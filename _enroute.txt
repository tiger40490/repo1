=====Q (Deepak19): given a black/white but mostly white matrix, for each cell, compute the least horizontal/vertial steps (shortest distance) to a black cell.

Theoretical limit: O(NN) assuming square matrix

--idea 1 (DP):
Scan#1 from top left, update each cell with a "left-score" i.e. shortest dist assuming all lower and rightside cells are hopeless.

Scan#2 from bottom right

Scan#3 (can be part of Scan#2)combine the data
