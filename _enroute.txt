It's relatively easy n enjoyable to review some of the classicGenerators problems. 

====Q [c !e] next split@N boys
====Q [c !e str] longest palindrome subsequence
====Given two positive decimal numbers , A and B , write an algorithm to find the precision of Number A and truncate number B to the same level of precision.

Eg: 
A=0.01
B=0.66789363
Output :- 0.66

Eg:- 
A=0.0067
B=0.06375813
Ooutput : 0.0637

Eg:- 
A=0.1
B=0.678
Op 0.6

Eg:-
A=0.001
B=0.67
O/p :0.67
============= problems below should be posted to blog
====Q[c L]: sort a list in O(N logN) but constant space? 
I think swap is way to go, but recursion stack space? iterative?

--merge sort using an aux array of same size
1) divide the array into 2^j segments each up to 2 elements, rembering the (segment) boundaries.
2) sort each segment
3) merge first 2 segments and output to a new array of N but only use the first few slots
4) similarly , merge 3rd and 4th segments into the new array, using the next few slots
Once we merge all pairs, entire new array is populated and old array can be reset to 0 and usable as a blank array
Now the segment boundaries are updated and reduced by half. When segment count becomes 2, we would be on the last merge.
5) repeat Step 3

In total we visit each of N nodes logN times
