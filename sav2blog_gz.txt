--new or update:
strategic orgro is elusive. I can only think of c++ (lots of IV, but not increasing my salary...) and python
I think every other tsn attampt has some "buts". Does it mean we should stop trying? No. If I had stayed within java/sql/perl then I would have been worse off.... fewer job opportunities,  less broadended techncial base

my tsn ambition/dream is largely constrained by risks:
* stigma/respect
* figure things out faster than colleagues

For these specific risks, my current risk tolerance is higher so I ought to be bolder.

Note these risks exist with/out tsn. If want to minimize these risks we need to find a low-calibre team like RTS, or OC (95G?)

--new blogpost ..
am i too preoccupied with PIP stigma? Spending this much time is probably unproductive.

The risk is real. So long as I have no thoughts about the topic i should keep working on it?

my tech xx can't be driven completely by IV. I would end up chasing the tails in jxee...
my tech xx can't be driven completely by the elusive concept of zbs.
my tech xx can't be driven by rank promotion including GTD as promotion is likely due to multiple factors

my c# xx journey was exciting but .. In contrast, my core-java/c++ (not jxee) journey has generated superior ROTI because 
* the topics are stable and 
* I was able to stick to these career directions

However, most of the java5 features are out of fashion in interviews. How about j8 features?

--workload concerns even when peers are not faster than me
Daniel Yan cited the factor of imposed deadline by exchange
Another person cited the fire-fighting mode
CSDoctor said in some companies like Huawei, there's unhealthy culture of long hours in the office, eroding family time, but i think this is rare nowadays. 
I feel most stressful "high performance" teams emphasize output and intensity ("productivity" and "efficiency") ... remember Kevin. 
However, my Barcap workload was not so heavy but high impact :)

--since 2007, very few examples of "effort->ROTI" including financial ROTI
(vague, not worth publishing)
* c++/C#/java IV pass rate
* pure algo IV pass rate
* online timed coding IV pass rate
* passive income growing including Energy12
* diet
