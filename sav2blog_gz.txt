--no blogpost: I actually felt good receiving low salary offers like Nasdaq and NCS
Somehow it confirms my value-add to the economy, my "health condition"

I think every other tsn attampt has some "buts". Does it mean we should stop trying? No. If I had stayed within java/sql/perl then I would have been worse off.... fewer job opportunities,  less broadended techncial base

--new?
my tsn ambition/dream is largely constrained by risks:
* stigma/respect
* figure things out faster than colleagues

For these specific risks, my current risk tolerance is higher so I ought to be bolder.

Note these risks exist with/out tsn. If want to minimize these risks we need to find a low-calibre team like RTS, or OC (95G?)

am i too preoccupied with PIP stigma? Spending this much time is probably unproductive.

The risk is real. So long as I have new thoughts about the topic i should keep working on it?

my tech xx can't be driven completely by IV. I would end up chasing the tails in jxee...
my tech xx can't be driven completely by the elusive concept of zbs.
my tech xx can't be driven by rank promotion including GTD, as promotion is likely due to multiple factors

my c# xx journey was exciting but .. In contrast, my core-java/c++ (not jxee) journey has generated superior ROTI because 
* the topics are stable and 
* I was able to stick to these career directions

However, most of the java5 new features are out of fashion in interviews. How about j8 features?
--since 2007, very few examples of "effort->ROTI" including financial ROTI
(vague, not worth publishing)
* c++/C#/java IV pass rate
* pure algo IV pass rate
* online timed coding IV pass rate
* passive income growing including Energy12
* diet
--new or update:
strategic orgro is elusive. Biggest success I can only think of is c++ (thanks to lots of IV) but in terms of salary increasae, I can't think of any... perhaps quant dev
