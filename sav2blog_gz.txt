--no blogpost: I actually felt good receiving low salary offers like Nasdaq and NCS
Somehow it confirms my value-add to the economy, my "health condition"

overrated -- engagement 
overrated -- strategic orgro
--new blogpost delights: strategic, engaged

I feel my expectation was invariably too high in terms of strategic value therefore underwhelming. (engagement ... expectation was moderately too high) Against this backgrop, there are little delights, but stigma/respect (not salary!) was too huge a factor and overshadowed those little delights. For a perspective, look at the spreadsheet "predict next 3-5Y job satisfactioni"

I chose a python job at Macq .. engaged for a few months and never disengaged, to my delight
I chose the c++ job at RTS .. engaged for 6 months, and never disengaged, to my delight. 
* Reason: interviews
* Reason: socket QQ was in-demand
* Reason: QQ discussions with colleagues .. visible progress

I chose a c# job ... engaged for a year, shorter than expected

I think every tsn attampt has some "buts". Does it mean we should stop trying? No. If I had stayed within java/sql/perl then I would have been worse off.... fewer job opportunities,  less broadended techncial base
no differentition from regular java guys
sql and perl falling out of fashion

my tsn ambition/dream is largely constrained by risks:
* stigma/respect
* figure things out faster than colleagues

For these specific risks, my current risk tolerance is higher so I ought to be bolder.

Note these risks exist with/out tsn. If we want to minimize these risks we need to find a low-calibre team like RTS, or OC (95G?)

my c# xx journey was exciting but .. In contrast, my core-java/c++ (not jxee) journey has generated superior ROTI because 
* the topics are stable and 
* I was able to stick to these career directions

However, most of the java5 new features are out of fashion in interviews. How about j8 features?
--since 2007, very few examples of "effort->ROTI" including financial ROTI
(vague, not worth publishing)
* c++/C#/java IV pass rate
* pure algo IV pass rate
* online timed coding IV pass rate
* passive income growing including Energy12
* diet
--new or update:
strategic orgro is elusive. Biggest success I can only think of is c++ (thanks to lots of IV) but in terms of salary increasae, I can't think of any... perhaps quant dev
