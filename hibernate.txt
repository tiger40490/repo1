--Re the net income impact, I gave up the 2k additional CVA for xx and carefree. Regret? No

--propose to Jay
Hi Jay,

Here's a new proposal
* I will take a sabastical for about 20 months starting Jul (or Aug, Oct) 2019
* will rejoin CEM in spring 2021, on my own to set things up for the family. I will then bring my family over before my son turns 13 in Aug.

Reason 1: to spend a few years with my aging parents. My last chance, as they can't travel to the U.S. to live with me.
Reason 2: More Chinese educatio for my kids, but my son needs to leave Singapore before turning 13 to avoid a heavy NationalService liability deposit
Reason : My h1b 6-year cap is limited. It's advantageous for me to save it by waiting for my green card outside U.S. I can recapture the 20 months spent outside the U.S.
Reason (minor): income and cost -- there's cost saving in living with family. Please note higher salary is not so important to me -- As you know I walked away from higher offers many times (Morgan Stanley, Pimco etc). I'm impressed with your flexibility, efficiency and trustworthiness so I plan to stay with your firm when I return.

Legal questions:
Q: My priority date will be unaffected since CEM won't revoke my i-140?
Q: China-EB2 vs China-EB3 queues. Not sure which is faster. I have a U.S. master degree (UChicago) so you can help me upgrade to EB2 when needed, right?
Q: my wife and daughter needs to be on the GC process, are they?

My decision is not finalized. If no good plan, then I can bring my family over in 2019 or 2020.

--notes on hibernaet timing
avoid accidental billing loss, so better arrive in SG and immediately start working. Better do that After Korea trip

--priority for sg search:
workload is more imp than commute or income, but workload is hard to predict.

So my tentative priorities:
* max salary with promised carefree
* commute
* LG - strategic tsn such as more c++

I still see more room for growth in my c++ecosystem profile, which primises to enhance my java profile

Java continues to be my stronger arm and lower-hanging fruit

今天收到美国移民部 I-140 批准函， 我正式完成绿卡过程第二阶段。 再等上几年就可以拿绿卡了。 I-140 批准意味着我可以选择换雇主调高薪水， 也可考虑回新工作几年。

2021年8月大宝13岁前要离新赴美 （以避免 $75000 兵役押金）。 美国9月开学， 可以5-7月来， 暖和。

在纽约换雇主..据说不难。 我不急。

回新最早2019年8月， 最晚 12 月。 几个原因：

* 工作压力： 目前很舒服， 值得珍惜。 
* 收入： 回新可能高一些， 但在纽约换雇主也可提薪， 而不换工作。
* 开支： 回新可以省 每月 $2000 左右 包括女佣，房租，机票
* 家人团聚： 目前几个月飞一次感觉很不错。 难得老板允许我在新加坡上班。
* 找工作 11 月开始淡季， 因此最晚 2019年10月找到工作， 最多要求推迟2个月上班。 
* 如果 2019年10月没找到工作，就2020年初再试。 不理想 -- 浪费我仅有的 6 年自由。 幸好仅浪费几个月。
