-- polytechnic teaching
Hi HK,

Thank you for the suggestion of polytechnic teacher as a second career.

As I said, my default plan is ... WallSt contractor SWE, a familiar, proven career path for me.

Since I enrolled in UChicago, I have repeatedly revisited the polytechnic career option
* math, computing .. are some of the subjects I'm probably qualified to teach
* good -- stable job. Low anxiety about retrenchment
* good -- I can stay in Singapore and attend to my mother and other family members.
* personal talents as a lecturer? Unsure. I think with good attitude, I can leverage on my talents and overcome my shortcomings as a lecturer.

I foresee that the biggest factor is personal attitude including commitment to the adjustment.
