--Filipinos (Caribbeans? Nigerians?) can speak decent Eng but 
Most can't earn a living in US/UK/Canada/Australia or Singapore.

Language proficiency is necessary but insufficient... There are huge cultural differences between two English-speaking countries at different affluence levels.

Affluence (more than the technology) determines the culture.

--income and cost of living in BGC
minimum salary P520/D in Manila
minimum salary P350/D in provincial rate

* BGC cleaner earns P537 a day. She said up to 13k a month, presumably including overtime.
* BGC supermarket cashiers earn up to 20k a month
* BGC Security guards (7 days a week) or call center guys probably earn 25k including overtime

I feel at the urban blue-collar level, it's roughly comparable to a SGD 2.5k job. SGD2.5k / PHP 25k = 4 times.

I believe BGC cost level is slightly higher than countryside. A foodcourt meal costs P150.

--I felt "very" low efficiency living in BGC
* limited mobility
* foods are not so easily available as in SG.

As in my first U.S. stay, having a car might remove half the frictions .

Big lesson learnt -- At this stage, except trivial cases cost-saving is beyond my "sphere of influence", but how about my diet and time-spend?
