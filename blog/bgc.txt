--NCT vs Aleris
[s] next few days of short term rental
[s] past HOA dues -- Anyway I will split the savings with NCT unless I back out of the lawsuit
[s=small amount] 

.. in favor or NCT
trust
I will need to rely on NCT once a while
[s] sunk cost sharing on the initial set-up

.. in favor of Aleris
I don't know the agent behind NCT. I know Aleris to some extent.
She takes note of my preferences and tries to meet my criteria regardless of other units. NCT doesn't care about my requirements, and operates a collective instead.
has staff
more professional relationship, rather than friend friend
far better documentation
more long-term, sustainable set-up
no worry about "what if NCT stops working there"

--After the 38k figure was revealed to me, the offer from Aleris didn't move, and I didn't sign any contract.

--fuxi: ph capital gain tax (6%) is supposed to be payable by seller, but seller would pass the amount to buyer and require buyer to pay

--fuxi: why rental yield varies so much across countries
culture is one reason (Chinese^American)

Aleris said traffic jam is another reason.

--new: damage during a stay
Before a tenant moves in, agency or previous tenant would clean up and take pictures.

Any damage would be deducted from security deposit

--fuxi: some of the BGC tenants are students learning english in Manila, and their parents. 

--fuxi: Contrary to some claims, compared to 2BR studios are faster to rent out. More affordable to more tenants including students and couples. 

--new expatriation .. large amount takes weeks, but Aleris could speed it up.

--new: Ph rental yield is effectively tax-free !
No one declares it.
Tax department has no manpower for it.

most rental prop owners don't pay tax. If you tell a tax preparer you want to declare rental income, she would ask what amount you prefer to declare. No evidence needed.

--new: Manila: foreign-owned condos are a different asset compared to local-owned units.

There's overdemand from other foreign investors, not only Chinese. Due to the 40% quota on each condo building, these guys can only buy from an f existing oreign owner.

In other words, a foreigner buying from a local would break 40% quota if the builing already has 40% foreign ownership.

--fuxi: Ashish and Sachin both prefer a company not an individual, even if fees are higher.

Raymond also felt NCT is not a company.

--fuxi: PNB accounts
AT-card account 3k maintenance balance. 0.01% pa interest.

Can deposit cash in CashAcceptanceMachine at Infinity branch

CD interest is quoted pretax ... about 0.375% pa for up to P250k. Tax rate is flat 20%
