--some of the tenants are students learnin g english in Manila, and their parents

--compared to 2BR, studios are faster to rent out. More tenants including students and couples. 

--Both PPE and Aleris prefer long-term rental

--transferring large amount takes weeks

--most rental prop owners don't pay tax. If you tell a tax preparer you want to declare rental income, she would ask what amount you prefer to declare. No evidence needed.

--Manila: foreign-owned condos are a different asset compared to local-owned units.

There's overdemand from foreign investors, not only Chinese. Due to the 40% quota on each condo building, they can only buy from another foreign owner.

In other words, a foreigner buying from a local would break 40% quota if the builing already has 40% foreign ownership.

--Genn on rental income tax 
how to report.
how many percent?
how does the tax department catch us?

--Genn on legal contract

Agency agreement -- need to document the fees and responsibilities.

--Ashish and Sachin both prefer a company not an individual, even if fees are higher.

Raymond also felt NCT is not a company.

--income and cost of living in BGC
minimum salary P520/D in Manila
minimum salary P350/D in provincial rate

* BGC cleaner earns P537 a day. She said up to 13k a month, presumably including overtime.
* BGC supermarket cashiers earn up to 20k a month
* BGC Security guards (7 days a week) or call center guys probably earn 25k including overtime

I feel at the urban blue-collar level, it's roughly comparable to a SGD 2.5k job. SGD2.5k / PHP 25k = 4 times.

I believe BGC cost level is slightly higher than countryside. A foodcourt meal costs P150.
