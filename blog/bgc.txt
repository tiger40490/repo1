--Genn on rental income tax 
how to report.

Agency agreement -- need to document the fees and responsibilities.

--Ashish and Sachin both prefer a company not an individual, even if fees are higher.

Raymond also felt NCT is not a company.

--income and cost of living in BGC
minimum salary P520/D in Manila
minimum salary P350/D in provincial rate

* BGC cleaner earns P537 a day. She said up to 13k a month, presumably including overtime.
* BGC supermarket cashiers earn up to 20k a month
* BGC Security guards (7 days a week) or call center guys probably earn 25k including overtime

I feel at the urban blue-collar level, it's roughly comparable to a SGD 2.5k job. SGD2.5k / PHP 25k = 4 times.

I believe BGC cost level is slightly higher than countryside. A foodcourt meal costs P150.
