--need to record the "closing cost" in addition to the purchase price
Raymond said P 200k+

--Filipinos (Caribbeans? Nigerians?) can speak decent Eng but 
Most can't earn a living in US/UK/Australia or Singapore.

Language proficiency is a necessary but insufficient condition. There are huge cultural differences between two English-speaking countries at different affluence levels. 

Affluence (more than the technology) determines the consumer culture

--I could possibly fly in again, given my abundance of paid leaves.

--NCT as the dispatcher, fairness is up to him. No simple way to enforce.

--this 4D3N experience living in BGC is a immersion training / dress rehearsal / internship for a MY retirement.

Now I think MY retirement plan is based on logical reasoning + insufficient facts. It has slightly fewer uncertainties due to proximity to Singapore.

I need friends or similar people (mostly Chinese) living nearby

--I felt "very" poor efficiency living in BGC
* zero mobility
* foods are not so easily available.

As in my first U.S. stay, having a car might remove half the frictions .

Big lesson learnt -- At this stage, except trivial cases cost-saving is beyond my "sphere of influence", but how about my diet and time-spend?

--PNB accounts
AT-card account 3k maintenance balance. 0.01% pa interest.

Can deposit cash in CashAcceptanceMachine at Infinity branch

CD interest is quoted pretax ... about 0.375% pa for up to P250k. Tax rate is flat 20%

--for my bare bones ffree set-up, One of the biggest uncertainties is predictability of cash-flow. 
Every investment has uncertainties aka risks. 
Experienced investors often categorize dozens of common risks into some 5 categories. 
The grouping is mostly conceptual and arbitrary.

As Wallace Xu said, probably rental prop mgmt needs the owner to stay local and learn the legwork.
