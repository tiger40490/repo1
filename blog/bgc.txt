--NCT vs Aleris
.. in favor or NCT
trust
next few days of short term rental
past HOA dues -- Anyway I will split the savings with NCT
sunk cost sharing on the initial set-up

.. in favor of Aleris
I don't know the agent behind NCT. I know Aleris to some extent.
She takes note of my preferences and tries to meet my criteria regardless of other units. NCT doesn't care about my requirements, and operates a collective instead.
has staff
more professional
much better documentation
one layer fewer. I deal directly with the local agent. no key-person risk
more long-term, sustainable set-up
no worry about "what if NCT stops working there"

--letter to support Chun Tih
My friend and fellow investor Ng Chun Tih is preparing a formal complaint against Megaworld. This letter is written to support him.

We are a group of investors, each buying a unit in OneUptownResidence in BGC

In the official Deed of Assignment, handover date was stated as .............. but we only received the keys in Oct 2019. Therefore, there's an opportunity cost. We expected Megaworld to offer a compensation for this delay, but I don't know if there was any offer

In addition to the sales price, there are varius fees charged. Between two identical units X and Y, we expect the total fees on Unit X vs total fees on Unit Y be identical, but actually very different.

Lastly, official documents from Megaword on our investments are invariably unsigned, and therefore non-legal. 
These documents can be amended or withdrawn at will by Megaworld, so we as buyers could never feel confident about any documentation from Megaworld. 
The only signed and legal document to date is the initial Deed of Assignment. 

--fuxi: ph capital gain tax (6%) is supposed to be payable by seller, but seller would pass the amount to buyer and require buyer to pay

--fuxi: why rental yield varies so much across countries
culture is one reason (Chinese^American)

Aleris said traffic jam is another reason.

--new: damage during a stay
Before a tenant moves in, agency or previous tenant would clean up and take pictures.

Any damage would be deducted from security deposit

--fuxi: some of the BGC tenants are students learning english in Manila, and their parents. 

--fuxi: Contrary to some claims, compared to 2BR studios are faster to rent out. More affordable to more tenants including students and couples. 

--new expatriation .. large amount takes weeks, but Aleris could speed it up.

--new: Ph rental yield is effectively tax-free !
No one declares it.
Tax department has no manpower for it.

most rental prop owners don't pay tax. If you tell a tax preparer you want to declare rental income, she would ask what amount you prefer to declare. No evidence needed.

--new: Manila: foreign-owned condos are a different asset compared to local-owned units.

There's overdemand from other foreign investors, not only Chinese. Due to the 40% quota on each condo building, these guys can only buy from an f existing oreign owner.

In other words, a foreigner buying from a local would break 40% quota if the builing already has 40% foreign ownership.

--fuxi: Ashish and Sachin both prefer a company not an individual, even if fees are higher.

Raymond also felt NCT is not a company.

--fuxi: PNB accounts
AT-card account 3k maintenance balance. 0.01% pa interest.

Can deposit cash in CashAcceptanceMachine at Infinity branch

CD interest is quoted pretax ... about 0.375% pa for up to P250k. Tax rate is flat 20%
