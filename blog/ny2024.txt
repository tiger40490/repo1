The Pscb banking trips took too long.... not worth it. I had limited time left for anything else.
passport: ICBC and HSBC completed quickly
winter clothing from Beijing .. I did /pick up/ some [socks, glove, thermal pants, jacket,,,]

Some of the jobs well done. I am (not only) "lucky" to achieve them . Few people can achieve them. :
* stitches x 2
* naps after lunch and at E36
* flossing x 2 during PEK->NY
* stretch .. multiple times

-- buy 
some healthy snacks -- peanuts, fruits, pre-washed salad
washing detergent
