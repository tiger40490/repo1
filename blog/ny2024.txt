The Pscb banking trips took too long.... not worth it. I had limited time left for anything else.
passport: ICBC and HSBC completed quickly
winter clothing from Beijing .. I did /pick up/ some [socks, glove, thermal pants,,]

Some of the jobs well done. I am (not only) "lucky" to achieve them . Few people can achieve them. :
* stitches x 2
* naps after lunch and at E36
* flossing x 2 during PEK->NY
* stretch .. multiple times

-- [o] review will #optional

Grandpa said no hurry. Can wait till next trip.
