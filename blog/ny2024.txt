-- I don't want to criticize myself on productivity
Q: what progress criteria do project assessors have for Fail/Pass/Exceed?
%%A: looks like very low bar. Lucky guy, or karma?

-- fuxi: well done
eco .. saving water and heating in hotel
laundry .. saving time, money (for employer), and water/electricity
food waste .. avoided every day, in every buying decision
I gave away lots of chocolates/peanuts as they became emotional baggage .. I didn't want to discard them.
was able to get up (and sleep) as planned
able to add value to Swat effort .. main j4 this entire trip
had some chia. The amount I brought is more than what I would need, so one or two servings (per week) are very good.
All my meet-up dinners featured healthy items.
yoga .. emphasized throughout
laptop .. avoid carrying it back n forth... reducing hazards
lipitor, dental .. consistently
-- fuxi: lucky so far
hotel-office commute very convenient
Swat team isn't going to look into Genepai limitations and the paper-over-cracks
Boss was helpful in many discussions
no sickness
wellness center
Some of the fancy restaurant dishes were actually special
===== time mgmt
-- fuxi: G5 priorities:
[1] engagement with swat team .. top priority of management. More important than Genepai-Algo
solitude campout mode and make progress on Genepai-algo
[5] maintain diet, workout. If workout requires time, then let's allocate the time. prefer simpler ones .. see bpost on NY2024 workout

-- distractions
:) no kids; no DIYHI; no mailbox
laundry .. luckily I found some routine
meetups
lipitor
fancy cakes, fruits .. luckily I found my way... red velvet cake, pistachio cake, small ice creams
fine dining on my own .. high tcost on research, plann,, Low value
nostalgic destinations .. 8thAve is similar to Flushing
===== update bpost on diet/workout
-- DosToros:
Bowl is much better value than tacos x2. SeeWhatYouPick. Total t$cost is much better than all the restaurants I have tried.
Overall, I feel wholesome about (my version of) DosToros. This came as a surprise. 

Starch .. rather low. Mostly in (controlled amount of) beans, farro
cooked veg .. tasty and not much oil
raw veg .. better taste in the bowl, than my all-raw veg
meat .. no visible fat
guaca .. slightly lighter than avocado. Portion size is limited by defaut :)
dips and chips .. not for me !

-- I chose to relax my "delay meal" rule again (relaxed frequently in SG like company meals, family meals...) because it was impractical at that time. As HuiMei said, I need quality of life.

-- 17 Jan I had lots of raw veg.
-- 18 Jan had some raw veg
gave away some starchy snack to Fiona
delayed lunch till 7pm. Relatively healthy DosToros meal. 
Greenwich lounge : careful food selection

If food quality is comparable in-flight vs at airport, then I would skip airport meal, to save cost for employer
