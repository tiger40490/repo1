I reviewed mtg 2023 statement well in advance, to pre-empt a key stressor that would emerge on 20 Jan 
I bend over backward to avoid plastic bottles in the hotel even though they provide it free
I bend over backward to avoid discarding foods, esp. expensive foods
eco .. saving water and heating power in hotel
laundry .. saving time, money (for employer), and water/electricity
food waste .. avoided every day, in every buying decision
I gave away lots of chocolates/peanuts as they became emotional baggage .. I didn't want to trash perfectly good food.
was able to get up (and sleep) as planned
able to add value to Swat effort .. main j4 this entire trip
had some chia. The amount I brought is more than what I would need, so one or two servings (per week) are very good.
All my meet-up dinners featured healthy items.
yoga .. emphasized throughout
laptop .. avoid carrying it back n forth... reducing hazards
lipitor, dental .. consistently
santander .. closed successfully.
L36 didn't give any problem as feared, partly because I took care of it... avoid carrying it enroute
I used *108* throughout my NYC stay, to save money for MLP

--fuxi: reflections on PEK stopover
Some of the jobs well done. I am (not only) "lucky" to achieve them . Few people can achieve them. :
* nursing home visit
* stitches x 2 .. needed in NYC
* naps at home after lunch, and at E36 .. cushion for the 15H ordeal
* flossing x 2 during PEK->NYC
* stretch .. multiple times
* cleared most of the reading materials, exceeding self-expectation
* delayed movies until I felt too sleepy

===== fuxi or update bpost on diet/workout
small ice creams, small cakes worked better for BMI and waste reduction, even though higher unit cost. The pistachio cake was way too big.
-- I chose to relax my "delay meal" rule again (relaxed frequently in SG like company meals, family meals...) because it was impractical at that time. As HuiMei said, I need quality of life.
