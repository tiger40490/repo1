I choose to relax my "delay meal" rule again (relaxed frequently in SG like company meals, family meals...) because it's impractical at this time. As HuiMei said, I need quality of life.

-- 17 Jan I had lots of raw veg.

-- I don't want to criticize myself on productivity

-- I could make some progress on tbl-codegen

-- fuxi: well done
eco .. saving water and heating in hotel
laundry .. saving time,,,,
food waste .. avoided every day, in every buying decision
I gave away lots of chocolates/peanuts as they became emotional baggage .. I didn't want to discard them.
was able to get up (and sleep) as planned
able to add value to Swat effort .. main j4 this entire trip
had some chia. The amount I brought is more than what I would need, so one or two servings (per week) are very good.
All my meet-up dinners featured healthy items.
yoga .. emphasized throughout
laptop .. avoid carrying it back n forth... reducing hazards
lipitor, dental .. consistently
-- fuxi: lucky so far
hotel-office commute very convenient
Swat team isn't going to look into Genepai limitations and the paper-over-cracks
Boss was helpful in many discussions
no sickness
wellness center
Some of the fancy restaurant dishes were actually special
===== time mgmt
Time is too limited. No spare capacity for sight-seeing or fine dining

-- fuxi: G5 priorities:
[1] engagement with swat team .. top priority of management. More important than Genepai-Algo
solitude campout mode and make progress on Genepai-algo
[5] maintain diet, workout. If workout requires time, then let's allocate the time. prefer simpler ones .. see bpost on NY2024 workout
[9] buying gifts for family .. too much time deciding what to buy

-- distractions
:) no kids; no DIYHI; no mailbox
laundry .. luckily I found some routine
meetups
lipitor
fancy cakes, fruits .. luckily I found my way... red velvet cake, pistachio cake, small ice creams
fine dining on my own .. high tcost on research, plann,, Low value
nostalgic destinations .. 8thAve is similar to Flushing

-- todo
[9] buy more snacks for family .. on the days without dining meet-ups
.. gummy bear
.. pecans (#1 most rare nuts in Sg): unsalted + honey-coated. Unsalted is more healthy, and less prone to binge
.. pistachio kernel (2nd rare nuts in Sg)
.. fancy chocolates but don't rush to buy as you may have to return
