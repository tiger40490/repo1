-- Sat plan:
Cosme

tcost: drip-dry.
tcost: washing during shower. Slower than handwash
tcost: rinse 

-- fuxi: well done
saving water and heating in hotel
I avoid food waste every day, in every buying decision
I gave away lots of chocolates/peanuts as they became emotional baggage .. I didn't want to discard them.
was able to get up (and sleep) as planned
able to add value to Swat effort .. main j4 this entire trip
had some chia. The amount I brought is more than what I would need, so one or two servings (per week) are very good.
had lots of fruits and raw veg
All my meet-up dinners featured healthy items.
lipitor .. consistently

-- fuxi: lucky so far
no jet lag
Swat team isn't going to look into Genepai limitations and the paper-over-cracks
Swat guys are nice
Boss was helpful in many discussions
no sickness
wellness center
Some of the fancy restaurant dishes were really special
===== time mgmt
Time is too limited. No spare capacity for sight-seeing or fine dining

-- fuxi: G5 priorities:
solitude campout mode and make progress on Genepai-algo
[1] engagement with swat team .. top priority of management. More important than Genepai-Algo
[5] maintain diet, workout. If workout requires time, then let's allocate the time
[9] buying stuff for family

[2] meetups

[1] engage with Swat team .. not really a distraction, but a "distraction to my Genepai-Algo" project
