-- fuxi: too many small stressor upon return to Sgp
cubicle set-up
unpack luggage
CNY24 plann, calling hotlines, 
prepare to engage with Jordhy and with Larry
make progress with Genepai
diet restriction and slim down .. lots of mental energy (beyond sys1 resources) required
fan remote + door closer #2
HRBlock + Oracle 
need time for reflective blogg/email, but no O2

Slowly my overloaded mind is unwinding and recovering

-- fuxi: well done
I reviewed mtg 2023 statement well in advance, to pre-empt a key stressor that would emerge on 20 Jan 
minimalist: I bend over backward to avoid plastic bottles in the hotel even though they provide it free
I bend over backward to avoid discarding foods, esp. expensive foods
minimalist: eco .. saving water and heating power in hotel
minimalist: laundry .. saving time, money (for employer), and water/electricity
food waste .. avoided every day, in every buying decision
I gave away lots of chocolates/peanuts as they became emotional baggage .. I didn't want to trash perfectly good food.
was able to get up (and sleep) as planned
able to add value to Swat effort .. main j4 this entire trip
had some chia. The amount I brought is more than what I would need, so one or two servings (per week) are very good.
All my meet-up dinners featured healthy items.
yoga .. emphasized throughout
laptop .. avoid carrying it back n forth... reducing hazards
lipitor, dental .. consistently
santander .. closed successfully.
L36 didn't give any problem as feared, partly because I took care of it... avoid carrying it enroute
I used *108* throughout my NYC stay, to save money for MLP

-- fuxi: lucky so far
meimie is very close to daddy
boy is improving drastically
NY remains a viable job market for me
Swat team isn't going to look into Genepai limitations and those paper-over-cracks
Boss was helpful in many discussions
no sickness, didn't lose anything
wellness center
tongue wound healed
starhub roaming ... see bpost https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/44172/starhub-billing-issues/

Q2: what measurable progress criteria do project assessors have in terms of Fail/Pass/Exceed?

Q2b: Lucky guy, or karma?
%%A: karma i.e. cause and effect

--fuxi: reflections on PEK stopover
Some of the jobs well done. I am (not only) "lucky" to achieve them . Few people can achieve them. :
* stitches x 2 .. needed in NYC
* naps at home after lunch, and at E36 .. cushion for the 15H ordeal
* flossing x 2 during PEK->NYC
* cleared most of the reading materials, exceeding self-expectation
* delayed movies until I felt too sleepy
* yoga block proved helpful
