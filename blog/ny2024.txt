-- Monday plann
return early to pack up. Buy luggage if needed

-- fuxi: well done
saving water and heating in hotel
I avoid food waste every day, in every buying decision
I gave away lots of chocolates/peanuts as they became emotional baggage .. I didn't want to discard them.
was able to get up (and sleep) as planned
able to add value to Swat effort .. main j4 this entire trip
had some chia. The amount I brought is more than what I would need, so one or two servings (per week) are very good.
had lots of fruits and raw veg
All my meet-up dinners featured healthy items.
yoga .. emphasized throughout
lipitor .. consistently
-- fuxi: lucky so far
Swat team isn't going to look into Genepai limitations and the paper-over-cracks
Swat guys are nice
Boss was helpful in many discussions
no sickness
wellness center
Some of the fancy restaurant dishes were actually special
no jet lag
===== time mgmt
Time is too limited. No spare capacity for sight-seeing or fine dining

-- fuxi: G5 priorities:
[1] engagement with swat team .. top priority of management. More important than Genepai-Algo
solitude campout mode and make progress on Genepai-algo
[5] maintain diet, workout. If workout requires time, then let's allocate the time

-- distractions
[9] buying stuff for family .. too much time deciding what to buy
:) no kids; no DIYHI; no mailbox
meetups
workout .. Reduce tcost allocation. prefer simpler ones .. see bpost on NY2024 workout
lipitor
fine dining on my own .. high tcost on research, plann,,
nostalgic destinations .. 8thAve is similar to Flushing

-- todo
[9] buy more snacks for family .. on the days without dining meet-ups
.. pecans (#1 most rare nuts in Sg): unsalted + honey-coated
.. pistachio kernel (2nd rare nuts in Sg)
