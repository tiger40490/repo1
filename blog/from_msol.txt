--iSOS
App is in company mobile. Need to register on the app.

Before travelling, better ask tech support how to set up data roaming…

In a foreign country, all medical costs are covered by Cigna, but we should call iSOS for advice or repatriation

@reboot is a special crontab feature

--new blogpost: standard free tools
I favor free, standard tools because in some places we have nothing else

•	Notepad++ and text files, instead of RTF 
•	Standard diff tools
•	VIM, available in git-bash !

--Martin's low-latency java talk
Deallocation is worse than allocation. Deallocation may use locking if performed across threads.

My Questions
Q: for low latency should we avoid concurrency ?

Q: If I don’t use heap, and only use stack and static memory….?
A: heap allows sharing between threads

Q: why is JIT not available to c++?

--new: cake better buy small slice
big ice-cream/cake is cheaper but more damaging than small slices.

Small slice is expensive but relieves me of the struggle, pain and guilt of overeating.

My last experience – big slice of choco cake from CakeHistory … unable to leave half to next day
--new blogpost: nuts
Very few people point out the high fat + high calorie content of just a few nuts. See the picture  of 100g of nuts in ….

Other website highlight that nut fat is heart-healthy.

I like the Raffles magazine summary – need portion control to tiny amount of nuts…. so tiny that I would rather eat a big serving once a few months.

I think tiny amount of nuts are good for salad.

My son doesn’t need so much heart-healthy fat. He can enjoy nuts but in very small quantity
--why I have a warming feeling for New York City
After talking to you about your first impression with NYC, I decided to take this opportunity to reflect why I have a warming feeling for the big apple.

Many Americans tell me NYC is full of energy.  There are many young people, and many events. They make me feel lively, not lonely. I certainly wish to see more Chinese faces. Luckily, some of the young people and older people attracted to New  York City are actually Chinese. 

The three Chinatowns in NYC (Manhattan Chinatown, Flushing and eighth avenue) make me feel less isolated than in other U.S. cities.  Jersey City also has a large Chinese population, much higher than an average U.S. city.

Incomes are slightly higher in NYC than other U.S. cities. I feel lucky for that. Even though prices are also higher, I don’t usually buy anything in Manhattan. As a result, I get to save more in NYC than other cities.
