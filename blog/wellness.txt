-- reflections on the kidney health brochure
no [:=zero or very low] pleasure in alcohol, salt, or gaming ... is loss of enjoyment but I wish to have this more boring life .. more a blessing than a curse

Angelina Jolie chose to have her breasts removed.. loss of pride, joy and pleasure, but compare that loss to the pain of kidney failure or long-term cancer care !

Mass media (beyond advertisement) portray pleasures in food, alcohol, tobacco, sex, extreme sports ... In contrast, my chosen lifestyle is boring. 
Boring lifestyle is correlated with less pain, less bodily harm [incl. illnesses]

More than 50% of the people secretely with that the consequence of those pleasures is a painless death at an earlier age than the boring life. Most of these individuals underestimate the length and severity of ill health during the twilight years.

Kidney patients have many diet restrictions. I guess some of them may consider the question "what would I tell my younger self?" I think some may face the stark choice between 2 lifestyles

* longevity as the priority. Restrict calories, sweet, alcoholic foods. Is such a life worth re-living? Perhaps this is a Buddhist perspective but I want to downplay the Buddist influence.
* pleasure as a basic priority, but plenty of sufferings down the road

-- new: OK to have a favorite workout@@ or update blogpost on workout priorities https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=10950&action=edit
.. the need to balance enjoyments with wellness priorities 
some people (mostly women) enjoy yoga and nothing else.
some people (mostly men) enjoy muscle training and nothing else .. I think many Americans do.
some people enjoy jogging among other cardios such as skip rope, and nothing else. I still find stadium more conducive than other jogging places.

I don't want to sound negative, alarming and detract from your enthusiasm for your favorite workout, but in each case there is a small risk of neglecting other exercises.

Too much muscle training can affect BMI and flexibility, two of the most important aspects of wellness. I am unlikely to become bulky, but flexibility is a traditionally neglected area.

Too much jogging can lead to loss of flexibility and muscle as we age.

Some women do mostly yoga including some limited strength training, so they lack CRE. Therefore, some combine yoga with cardio. 

Ideally, you would want to enjoy a range of workouts, but few individuals are so lucky. For every adult and child, consistent workout is repetitive and requires a lot of effort and absorbency. Team sports and golf are more fun but requires a lot of external help.
