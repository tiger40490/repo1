-- new: when I come home, I look forward to (expectation of) a reward for the sacrifices, an unwinding of the strict control 
I feel I deserve some comfort food.

It feels too harsh to deny myself of the comfort foods.

Luckily I don't demand starch or fattty comfort foods.
Fancy fruits are fine.

-- new: stay above 56 kg
As my height shrinks to 1.74, a 18.5 BMI would mean 56.0 kg.
That would be deep-green for me. 

Probably well before that, I would look too thin to be acceptable to myself.

-- fuxi or new: wellness effort = uninspiring
I told grandpa that 1)diet and 2) weekly exercise are more important than earn-more/move-up.

However, wellness effort (esp. diet restriction) is not inspiring, not exciting, not engaging. We have to accept that, if we want to maximize our lifetime total happiness.

Some women may find diet restriction a short-term sacrifice for a huge gratification -- improved body shape.

-- new: wrong* temptations@family outing

Option: eat nothing, but it's hard to enjoy the family outing. Tough choice.
Option: controlled indulgence, but the cCost is extremely dangerous
Option: just stay out of the scene. Perhaps leave early.

.. tip: bring fruits + raw veg
.. tip: eat dessert only.


-- fuxi: the MLP monitor in Room2 can become a hindrance to the more-standing initiative. Detach it at times.

-- fuxi: the picnic basket (and wife's picnic food) is 
* high starch
* relatively high fat due to cheese, creams, baking oily/starchy
* very low amount of veg (less than 1% by weight)

It's error-prone to extrapolate. To me, most fancy foods, special occassion foods are tasty due to starch + fat. Raw veg is the least welcome feature.

In a way, the vast majority of people (in my familiar places) are attracted by foods high in starch, fat and sugar. Therefore, it requires daily battles and "personal strengths" (see my blogpost) to resist the temptations. 

In hindsight, I feel I ate too much starch even when not so tasty. In contrast, at LZ.Yu's dinner, I had very little starch, not even the corn

Wrong-time temptation .. I fought a good battle.
Wrong-quantity temptation .. can do better next time. My son was far more successful.
wrong-food temptation .. luckily I had my carrots. My son didn't like some of the starchy/oily foods and discard them after one byte. Good for him.

--fuxi or new: bigger risk: too(much^little)nice food@home
I feel 80% of the risk is the too-much risk

In the too-little scenario (too little healthy comfort food at home), I could end up eating ice cream, or toast+peanut butter, or quick noodles, or peanuts

In Bayonne, I had too little food at home and I coped well.

I have tried Ikea cafe food more than 10 times. I think it's slightly healthier than average. 
Obviously, at every restaurant, your personal choice of foods is the deciding factor. Ikea tends to offer more varieties of relatively healthy choices.

Still, I believe "reasonable" self-disciple in this context is simply insufficient. Your nutrional balance is probably reasonable, but there would be too much fat and insufficient vegetables. The overal c-cost would be too high.

I think most  attractive foods are similar. It's rare to find attractive yet healthy foods. 

-- fuxi: why no toothache in the last 10-20Y, basically never since 1991 /whereas/(not "while") I had toothaches in China? 
No age pattern among the population.
So I guess I'm just lucky.

My dental care is one contributing factor including brushing and frequent checks.

-- fuxi: knowing that BMI is not that critical when your nutiional mix is excellent, I still want to ask
Q: is it possible to put on weight by eating lots of carrots, and other raw veg + fruits?
A: I don't think so.

I think the amount of meat, starch and fat might be underestimated.

Cocacola and other beverage vendors have worked for decades to improve the appeal of sugar-free products.

I think most people still find those drinks inferior and not much better than water.

I think Colacola is trying to keep the customer hooked...

Most cusomers would buy the sugar-free version once a while, and buy the sugary version most of the time. The sugar-free version makes the customer less likely to detract.

-- fuxi: learn (on video) the basics of air-boxing to add fun to jogging. 

-- fuxi: many women are married to husbands who don't pay enough attention to flexibility. Both husband and wife suffer as a result
Men are natually tighter.
I feel proud about my commitment (more than attitude) to flexibility. I think it's foresight.

-- fuxi: looking at my yoga classmates including many super-flexible women, I remind myself that they are probably unimpressive in fitness, balance, strength etc.

I realize my priorities are
1) BMI
2) cardio and muscle endurance
) strength
) flexibility
) power

So I feel my current position is superior and enviable compared to them.

--fuxi: when making smoothie, remember the risk of one contaminated ingredient spoiling the entire smoothie.
If you have something very delicious or costly (time or $) then don't put too many other ingredients esp. if they could be unclean

--fuxi: floor fwd bend: better start with knees bent

--fuxi: as I told boy...
when i face a wrong-* temptation outside home, I only need to say NO once. There's no wrong-qty temptation. The high price tag is on my side.

when i face a wrong-* temptation at home, I need to say NO over and over. There's less wrong-food temptation. The 'soon-to-be-discarded' SMS is an enemy.

--fuxi: mix veg rice without rice, with potato
I could try this more. 
Without rice, I felt less guilty, more free

tanko asked: if healthy longevity is so important to you, what else are you doing beside diet and exercise?
I mentioned strong family bond, peaceful, robust response to adversities such as bonus stigma
Then I mentioned wife's health will be a key factor in my golden years. I might become more dependent on her as I grow older. I will learn to be more independent.

sexual health is another factor for "healthy longevity" though I didn't tell him.

--fuxi:
how would LKY or a rich guy deal with the temptations of home cooking?

What if money is not an issue? i would live away from family for several days when my diet gets out of control.
Or I could have a maid and give the left-over food to her.
