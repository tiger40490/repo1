-- Henry Lew suggestions:
Sugg 1: After seeing the home-cooked dinner, allocate a fixed portion for the night. Do not keep eating beyond that. 

Sugg 1b: Reduce allocation by 20%. The body and mind may not notice it.

Sugg 2: pre-emptive compensation .. Predict "night time compensation". If positive, then eat some starch (or whatever enticing food) before going home.
Then at home reduce the "allocation" by the pre-comp amount.

Sugg 3: when the craving starts, locate the part of the body. Then locate another part of the body that's comfortable. That makes a pair. Breathe in to the craving part, and breathe out to the comfort part.

enviable BMI can come at disproportionate cost
* Older adults often need to fight, on their back heels, an uphill battle to retain muscles. Losing muscle can reduce your BMI but it also affects your metabolism rate
* amputation can reduce your BMI, but do you want that?
