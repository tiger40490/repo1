Q: EastCoast family outing -- in what contexts would I "be there" with family at McDonald's without eating the wrong foods?

It's revealing that if I don't go near McDonald's then I won't feel any appetite, but if I spend more than 3 minutes there with family, the (wrong time) temptation would feel irresistible.

A: if I'm more than 95% full then only I would feel no appetite for the ice cream. The level of physical fullness is a very poor predictor of appetite!
A: if I spend only half a minute at McDonald's, without prior planning.

Bao3shan1 -- eating one ice cream is not that bad if I don't continue eating 5 more.

With watermelon (and some low-calorie smoothies), I feel very safe in the sense that even though I could be very full after overeating, most of the stuff would go out of my system soon and I would not put on weight.

--fuxi:
if i eat dinner when not hungry, I can get very hungry in the morning, even though dinner calorie content was very high.

This confirms my observation that calorie-induced hunger is mostly about timing

--update blogpost on overeat
clean, simple tofu is safe to overeat -- low starcch, low fat, some protein, high water content

if you are serious about visible fat, then avoid meat coated with flour. More than half the times I find skin or fat concealed by the coating.

"wrong time" is such a prevalent problem in SG (U.S. is costlier and less convenient). It is a problem even at food court, but the $$cost requires me to choose only one meal. The cost makes me slow down and think.

With home meal there's no speed bump! So we have to exercise self-constraint which is tough for most of us.

eat lots of veg + fruits + milkshake
