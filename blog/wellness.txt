Why is fitness class easier than self-practice?
Self-practice requires constant SMS, constant motivating (like dRam refresh), constant push beyond the comfort zone. Lots of system2 work.
For example, after a rest we need System 2 to decide when to restart, set a target and keep count.
In a class, we can relax System2 and follow the instructor and other students. System 1 is efficient.

Remember the Bayonne yoga class led by the Russian student.

-- fuxi: flexibility is a lifelong struggle, visible weakness
Rather few parts of my life has been this difficult.

persistent, hopeless lack of positive feedback .. Promethean struggle.
The more I focus on flexibility, the worse I tend to feel.
Now I'm learning to focus on it and take some actions.

-- fuxi: Belinda pointed out mobility vs flexibility (obstacle holding some body part) 
She hinted that mobility might be more important to many older people.
-- update yoga frq (which blogpost?)
at twice a week, the total hours would be 3 to 5/wk, based on my Bayonne experience. This is much more than the hours I can allocate to all other workouts combined. Therefore, the tcost is unsustainable.

Reality is, yoga isn't life-saving like kidney dialysis that must be performed weekly. Most guys are unable to do 3 sessions/week and therefore 3 sessions/week is unrealistic for most people, just like 5 workouts/week.Â 

The sustainable tcost has to be based on self-practice.

"you need to increase practice" otherwise progress will remain very slow. 6M is not long enough. Improvement can take decades
shoulder needs opening. Y-junction would then open up
Breathe through nose, never mouth.

Yoga is not a contest. 

When I'm very tight in some part, then certain pose is tough but beneficial, and good ROI and ROTI. 
In contrast, some very flexible students don't improve and don't benefit much in terms of flexibility (they come for relaxation), and may feel compelled to go into more advanced poses. I guess those poses are more difficult and dangerous, therefore hard to practice without assistance, 

-- new: OK to have a favorite workout@@ or update blogpost on workout priorities https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=10950&action=edit
.. the need to balance enjoyments with wellness priorities 
some people (mostly women) enjoy yoga and nothing else.
some people (mostly men) enjoy muscle training and nothing else .. I think many Americans do.
some people enjoy jogging and nothing else. I still find stadium more conducive than other jogging places.

I don't want to sound negative, alarming and detract from your enthusiasm for your favorite workout, but in each case there is a small risk of neglecting other exercises.

Too much muscle training can affect BMI and flexibility, two of the most important aspects of wellness. I am unlikely to become bulky, but flexibility is a traditionally neglected area.

Too much jogging can lead to loss of flexibility and muscle as we age.

Some women do mostly yoga including some limited strength training, so they lack CRE. Therefore, some combine yoga with cardio. 

Ideally, you would want to enjoy a range of workouts, but few individuals are so lucky. For every adult and child, consistent workout is repetitive and requires a lot of effort and absorbency. Team sports and golf are more fun but requires a lot of external help.
-- new or fuxi: flatus
Low-fodmap diet can reduce it.
some medication could help reduce it.
sanitary pad (40/$1.20) .. absorbent; cheaper
-- new: Dr Wee [gastro specialist] said
Liver cancer always comes with (verifiable) liver symptoms. If tests show no symptom, then basically no chance of liver cancer.

Regular ultrasound enough for annual screening. AFP could remain elevated. Rising AFP could be a cause of concern.

Sleep deprivation (not late sleep per se) can increase dementia risk, but not liver or other organs

I asked moderna vs Sinovac. Sinovac less effective -- antibody level is lower. better use Pfizer booster.

.. fatty liver
Always due to diet+workout
Many people have fatty livers but clean blood test -- not to worry.

Need to get knowledgeable and get used to fatty liver.

== fuxi: buy a yoga mat
Leave it on the floor everyday. Not so much space
A kind of nudge. It may or may not be enough to overcome the huge obstacle. 

Sugg: get kids to sit on it and play.
Sugg: get wife to ..
sugg: sit on it in lotus when watching a movie
but I already have good alternatives.

sugg: improve push-up a bit. 
but I already have good alternatives.

alternative -- the black exercise mat? Not a yoga mat and may not help encourage me to practice. If I were to buy, it has to be thick enough.

When I bought the standing desk, I also envisioned using it for leg stretch ..

-- Disuse after honeymoon? If it can increase my practice by 1h/week for 20 weeks, it's worthwhile. But I don't envision myself keep it there for years.
cost compared to yoga classes?
cost compared to the importance of stretch?

I had a blue yoga mat for years ... 

Q: lifestyle creep, knowing that after 20 weeks it would be put away?
