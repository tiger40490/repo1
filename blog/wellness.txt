--new: yoga tips from Steve
Steve spoke some truths that other instructors couldn't
* sugg: hold longer, like yin yoga, and rest in the pose.
* sugg: need to relax much more. If you are tense, then the muscle can't stretchÂ 

The pain in the affected body part ... is part of the process. It would improve over time. Should not be uncomfortable at the whole-person level meaning you must be able to relax with the pain. It's possible.
There's a harmony between the pain and the relaxation.
