--why weekly yoga is harder than diet, jogging, codingDrill..
yoga, diet daily battle, coding drill .. all feel like Promethean struggles.

Why was yoga so utterly hopeless compared to the others? 
* key reason -- whatever my effort, I remain clearly way below average among the "peers" though in reality those "peers" are mostly women and yoga instructors

* key reason -- yoga is too hard to hold and require too much willpower. Jogging and coding drill are better. The yoga poses I pick are way too painful. I can barely hold for 5 seconds but I force myself to hold many times longer. I set an unrealistic target and set myself up for failure

* reason (?) -- i don't see any progress. This is actually a common "phenomenon" in diet, coding drill, jogging etc. Somehow I used this argument for decades to dismiss the idea of daily stretch.

--yoga: i tend to compare with ..
1. I tend to compare with long-time practitioners. Note most long-time practitioners are pretty good at yoga. I'm a real hero because I am a long-time practitioner even though I'm not good at it.

2. Most of the experienced practitioners are women. I end up treating them as my peers.

3. for guys, I mostly look at yoga instructors.

4. for the regular guys, I mostly look at the poses they are good at and basically ignore the many more poses that I'm good at.

--new: yoga4life: regular practice

.. frq and duration
Aim at 1 min/session, 5 sessions a week, for 2 months.
Longer sessions? not practical due to my current mental block
short sessions have the "anywhere" advantage
less frq? not so effective. 

.. modest vs tough poses
In Macq corridor, I focused on only the hard poses and gave up within weeks. Now I want to use modest ones.

Jess Lin said even the easy poses can be helpful. 

Jess said many easy poses can become harder when you focus on your form.
Downward dog is good case in point.

I would use mostly modest poses, and try hard ones only when in the mood.

When you stop breathing (perhaps in the tough zone), your focus is off and you are no longer doing yoga.

.. how many poses?
Pick from a modest pool of 20 poses. There are hundreds of poses but I can ignore them for my life and still have a rewarding yoga habit.

.. yoga self^group practice
For lifelong practice, foundation has to be self practice. I don't want to rely solely on the fancy facilities.. unsustainable.

Classes can get me into the tougher zone and longer session. Classes can also reboot a declining routine.

--xp
eating lots of fruits + veg even when not hungry didn't add to my weight.

I feel starch, fat and perhaps protein add to my weight.

Fish? Not sure

milk? not sure

--new: ## easy stretches I can do any time, even at home
* lotus on sofa
* downward dog
* back/side bend, twist

--Q: why buy mixed veg rice when I have free home cooking?
A: there are many veg (+meat) missing in my home cooking
A: qty-tempation in home cooking. Outside food is rationed
When I reach home late and the leftover is boxed up, I feel no obligation to "finish that tiny amount". 

--fuxi: 
sugar + fat + salt is the common description of modern processed food.

For me the killer combo is starch + fat + sugar, in that order.

--fuxi: the pizzahut experience

I couldn't stick to my rule "no food if not hungry". I decided to break my rule but I fought a Baoshan war :

* chia seeds ... added to mushroom soup 
* cabbage + onion ... added to pizza
* I ordered the veg soup instead of mushroom soup

Every small decision counts. I feel proud of myself.

--new (jolt): yoyo diet != trivial
The "relax" phase must not become too unconstrained, otherwise the tight-belt phase will become too hard too long, to slowly get rid of the excesses. 

Therefore, if a yoyo diet actually reduces weight without serious side effects, it is rather effective and successful.

Nothing to laugh at.

If you laugh at yoyo diet, just try to reduce your own weight. You will realize how damn hard it is.

--fuxi: for stable cholesterol level, one test per year is good enough. 
Remember to include full blood count

--new: yoga is strategic
Yoga is somewhat strategic to my current lifestyle, as I could feel the physical "decline" more often

In contrast, BMI, cardio .. are more likely to be strategic.

However, yoga Can (not could, not merely in-theory) have a slow, long-term effect on my mental + physical health.
Regular yoga can possibly help some mild hypertension patients. I think breathing and meditation are relevant.
it can help me learn to relax
it helps me open myself to a proven method of relaxation.
It can slowly build my self-confidence that I could overcome something really hard.
It can slowly build my self-esteem that I could keep working on a really serious weakness, almost like a handicap, like stammer.

To a lesser extent, starch reduction has a similar effect on my self-confidence and long-term lifestyle benefit

--fuxi: nutrient timing is invented for ultra-endurance athletes. The reserach findings are not directly applicable to the ordinary people.
--fuxi when it comes to calorie counting, One of the least noticed math features is
various degrees of "bad" when we decide to loosen up and eat bad food
I feel creamy cakes are among the worst, but for most people, it is probably impractical to completely avoid creamy foods as if they were opium. Various degree of bad -- fried peanut and alcohol are both worse than creamy.. tobacco is worst than alcohol and drugs are worse than tobacco. 

In the mass media, we can see the different attitudes towards different categories of "bad" foods

More stupid are the calorie-dense foods that aren't satisfying -- fried peanuts; alcohol; mint ice-cream; cheese chunks; 

--fuxi: yoga or jogging [1] can interfere with my xx/codingDrill, boy's math, work laser ...

[1] swimming is more time consuming.

mini-exercise is less interference

--fuxi: wellness review on bizclass flight
* salad very healthy, without dressing. I at the more salad today than any day over last 6M
* three servings of fruits
* rice I didn't eat up, better than before
* some stretching
* plenty of water
* moderate red wine for heart health
* restraint on cakes, chocolate, ice cream etc, not as unconstrained as before

--fuxi: luxury, medically unnecessary -- these commercial offerings are effective for some athletes or patients, but not clinically proven to be nearly as effective as medicines
* skincare products
* hair treatments
* most MLM supplements
* meal timing
