Why BMI challenge is so tough in SG vs U.S... could be 1)home cooking or 2)homeostatic hunger in the SG climate
With the same food intake, in the U.S. I tend to feel less hungry.

-- new: delay breakfast^reward early rise
If i didn't really get up early, then perhaps no need to reward

-- new or fuxi: 
The focusing illusion exaggerates the importance of flexibility, and exaggerates my Relative weakness, as compared to a published instruction. 

Q: what's the published vs experienced pains/dangers of inflexibility?

Q: what's the publisied vs experienced benefits of stretch, breathing or meditation?

The published studies are from different sources. Tother they prove beyond reasonable doubt that yoga has no major side effects. As to the benefits, studies often say "can improve ...". It reminds me of my myopic treatments in Beijing [laser, massage] and my Indian colleagues' experience of ginseng. 

Experienced benefits are obvious (will not elaborate today) in CRE, strength. Some of those benefits are shared with (the strenguous form of) yoga.

Experienced pains of poor CRE/strength are obvious (will not elaborate today).

Flexibility does (I believe) help reduce probability and severity of injuries. I also believe in delaying the decline of flexibility. The decline is inevitable for 99% of men, due to aging.

However, the yoga style deep stretch may not improve flexibility, partly because the improvement has a half-life = 1week.

Aura yoga: $55 for 10D unlimited. Good for when I return to office
