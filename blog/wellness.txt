-- update bpost on 5/wk
my 5/wk routine is the /exemplification/ of successZ, and really tough except during a few weeks when I'm motivated and confident. (However, that "honeymoon" lasts rarely exceed a month.)

Most adults (like 98%) between 18 and 60 who are not in army would find it really tough. (Servicemen and Pre-college students are different because they have physical training + fitness tests.)
In their views, which type of workout of this bpost is most frequently questioned as too light? 
A: skiprope, squat... but "their view" is based on popular perception only.

In my own view which workout is most frequently questioned as too light?
A: skiprope, stairs

Frequency is the key and also the real challenge. To maintain frequency, I increase variety, and incorporate incentives.

when people say avocado, nuts, salman...are good for slimming, and backed by research, they mean "better than the mainstream junk foods".

If you are already on healthy diet, then those could be more less healthy!
