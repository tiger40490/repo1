eating lots of fruits + veg even when not hungry didn't add to my weight.

I feel starch, fat and perhaps protein add to my weight.

Fish? Not sure

milk? not sure

--## easy stretches I can do any time, even at home
* lotus on sofa
* downward dog

--fuxi: 
sugar + fat + salt is the common description of modern processed food.

For me the killer combo is starch + fat + sugar, in that order.

--fuxi: the pizzahut experience

I couldn't stick to my rule "no food if not hungry". I decided to break my rule but I fought a Baoshan war :

* chia seeds ... added to mushroom soup 
* cabbage + onion ... added to pizza
* I ordered the veg soup instead of mushroom soup

Every small decision counts. I feel proud of myself.

--new (jolt): yoyo diet != trivial
The "relax" phase must not become too unconstrained, otherwise the tight-belt phase will become too hard too long, to slowly get rid of the excesses. 

Therefore, if a yoyo diet actually reduces weight without serious side effects, it is rather effective and successful.

Nothing to laugh at.

If you laugh at yoyo diet, just try to reduce your own weight. You will realize how damn hard it is.

--fuxi: for stable cholesterol level, one test per year is good enough. 
Remember to include full blood count

--new: yoga is strategic
Yoga is somewhat strategic to my current lifestyle, as I could feel the physical "decline" more often

In contrast, BMI, cardio .. are more likely to be strategic.

However, yoga Can (not could, not merely in-theory) have a slow, long-term effect on my mental + physical health.
Regular yoga can possibly help some mild hypertension patients. I think breathing and meditation are relevant.
it can help me learn to relax
it helps me open myself to a proven method of relaxation.
It can slowly build my self-confidence that I could overcome something really hard.
It can slowly build my self-esteem that I could keep working on a really serious weakness, almost like a handicap, like stammer.

To a lesser extent, starch reduction has a similar effect on my self-confidence and long-term lifestyle benefit

--fuxi: nutrient timing is invented for ultra-endurance athletes. The reserach findings are not directly applicable to the ordinary people.
--fuxi when it comes to calorie counting, One of the least noticed math features is
various degrees of "bad" when we decide to loosen up and eat bad food
I feel creamy cakes are among the worst, but for most people, it is probably impractical to completely avoid creamy foods as if they were opium. Various degree of bad -- fried peanut and alcohol are both worse than creamy.. tobacco is worst than alcohol and drugs are worse than tobacco. 

In the mass media, we can see the different attitudes towards different categories of "bad" foods

More stupid are the calorie-dense foods that aren't satisfying -- fried peanuts; alcohol; mint ice-cream; cheese chunks; 

--fuxi: yoga or jogging [1] can interfere with my xx/codingDrill, boy's math, work laser ...

[1] swimming is more time consuming.

mini-exercise is less interference

* most MLM supplements
* meal timing
