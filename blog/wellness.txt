* lipido .. Doctor said a urologist could prescribe medication but I don't feel a need for it.
* wine to help sleep. Red wine in moderation has health benefits (will try it more). All wines are better than sleeping pills but it's not idea to depend on substances for sleep. Occassional use of wine for sleep is OK.
* yellowish .. Doctor noticed improvement over 11 months. Face is less affected than palm and sole. Doctor has done all the test needed to assess health risks associated with yellowish skin.

on a staycation, just about every meal is supposed to be special and invariably (like 99%) unhealthy.

In reality, my family members can accept ordinary meals, but I (and some of them) tend to have a hard time accepting it, as I really want to give them a memorable experience.

I often regret on two fronts -- calorie control out-of-control; waste of money on forgettable foods (not really memorable for any one of us).

What can we do? Perhaps keep an open mind about food choices.

99% of advertized foods in mass media are calorie-dense by my standard -- high starch (#1 most common), high fat (#2 most common) [creamy]

I basically rely on Sys2 to ignore and avoid those attention grabbers, but Sys1 would be drawn to them automatically.

to meet my intimacy needs (underfucked), wife needs to sacrifice sleep either late night, or early morning.

For the early morning, I can identify with her. Effort required.

To "steal" on boy's outing days, I would need to stay fit every day. That's not easy and demands absorbency.

To keep meimei in her own room, I would need to give up my study room, and also buy a new bed for her. Wife needs to do a lot of work to persuade her.

-- new : yoga!= supposed2b %% #1 weakness
Each person, me included, has some flexible areas and some stiff/tight areas. My overall flexibility is average among men of my age. Most of the men I see are Chinese, Indian or Caucasian, with slight differences in average stiffness.

Even when compared to women regardless of age, I am probably average. I can recall my observations in Bayonne and the ClassPass yoga. Many women praised my flexibility in various poses, but I tend to forget or brush them off.

Only in RealYoga do I feel a consistent and visible weakness. I feel like a weakling, a handicapped person.
Unknown to me, RealYoga members are mostly advanced practitioners. RealYoga is possibly the wrong place to start for a self-conscioius beginner.

Primarily based on RealYoga experience, I tell people my flexibility is my biggest weakness. It has become a body image problem.

Q: why did I care that much about my "handicap" in flexibility but not my handicap in .. stutter, slow handwriting, yellowish skin?
A: focusing illusion. RealYoga sessions always focuses my attention on the relative weakness and limitation.

Why BMI challenge is so tough in SG vs U.S... could be 1)home cooking or 2)homeostatic hunger in the SG climate
With equivalent amount of intake, in the U.S. I tend to feel less hungry.

If i didn't really get up early, then perhaps no need to reward

-- new or fuxi: 
The focusing illusion exaggerates the importance of flexibility, and exaggerates my Relative weakness. That weakness is obvious when I compare myself to a published instruction on any yoga pose. 

Q: what's the published vs experienced difficulties (or dangers) due to inflexibility?

Q: what's the publisied vs experienced benefits of stretch, breathing or meditation?

The published studies are from different sources. Together they prove beyond a reasonable doubt that yoga has no major side effects. As to the benefits, studies often say "can improve ...". It reminds me of my myopic treatments in Beijing [laser, massage] and my Indian colleagues' experience of ginseng. 

Experienced benefits are obvious (will not elaborate today) in CRE and strength. Some of those benefits are shared with (the strenguous form of) yoga.

Experienced pains of poor CRE/strength are obvious (will not elaborate today).

Flexibility does (I believe) help reduce probability and severity of injuries. I also believe in delaying the decline of flexibility. The decline is inevitable for 99% of men, due to aging.

However, the yoga style deep stretch may not improve flexibility, partly because the improvement has a half-life = 1week.
