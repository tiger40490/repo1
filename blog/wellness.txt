--new: fried starch: lousy bargain
Fried starch is
·         Extremely Binge-risky, more so than fat alone or starch alone
·         More calorie-dense than starch
·         Not always tasty. As such, it offers a lousy bargain.

Some familiar fried starch foods
·         Potato (and corn) chips and French fries
·         Starch Coating on fish/meat before frying
·         Bun in chili crab
