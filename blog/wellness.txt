--new: left-over noodles
when I turned down wife's invitation to finish meimei's left-over noodles at Vivocity, it was the archetypical daily battle.
wrong-time temptation is the opponent of this battle. Every time I concede a heavy calorie casulty, it had better be a conscious decision [1], not a mindless action, going with the flow.

This conscious decision requires a certain tcost that I need to understand. Not tcost of nutritional research but a tcost of thinking through and making that decisions [1] -- tcost of fighting THE battle.

There are so many such daily battles everyday. The tcost adds up.
There's a huge roti to this huge tcost -- as I change my habits, I would change my destiny. 

[1] Am not advocating impossibly tough abstinence. Am advocating conscious decision based on quick but highly personal cost/benefit analysis.

Earlier in the same day, I made a conscious decision to eat grandma's cornflour bread, millet porridge with fresh onion, fish and long beans. That was a lighter and much healthier meal than the left-over noodles! 

Later in the same day, I made a conscious decision to eat a sweet dessert at Vivocity Kopitiam. Less starchy, lots of ice, therefore much lighter.

Both meals are more satisfying !
--update blogpost on "best starch": grandma said some raw grains are more fibrous, but to me, all grans are starch
Starch means addictive, wrong-quantity temptation, and heavy impact on weight.

I still prefer green peas and beans for the lower starch density

--new: cakes feel richest
tags: comfort food, temptation
Among all addictive, craving foods, creamy cakes are by far the most seductive, more powerful. 
Cakes feel richer, heavier, more satisfying and more damaging than ice cream, nuts...

Fortunately, cakes fill me up quickly so I am unable to eat 2 kilos.

--new: starch feels more filling than fat
Protein is the new contender. I should consider protein as a viable hunger fighter.

--new:
eg: 10 min actual swim takes 30 min in the water, and at least 1 hour total due to commute + shower etc
eg: 50 min yoga class requires about 3H including wind-down.

For these workouts, if you try to reduce the 'spillage' you may hit a stonewall.

eg: jogging has much lower spillage
eg: mini-workout has the lowest spillage

I used to undervalue the Roti of workout
Now I feel prioritizing workout (over other t-spend) means accepting the spillage
