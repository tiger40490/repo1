--new: BMI L@ctrl: self-care^self-hate
a big part of my cabin fever is diet loss@control, esp. the wrong-time temptation.

I'm used to be in control, so the loss of control is devastating, degenerative and destructive.

self-hate, unreasonable expectation are part of the underlying.

What we need is compassion and self-care. In my preoccuation with BMI, I fail to recognize and celebrate the huge effort and success in
* avoid family meal when not hungry
* starch
* fat
* raw veg + fruits
* chia seeds

Pehraps my diet is not lost, but BMI battle is in decline. If that's the case then we need the bao3shan1 strategy.

Perhaps the increased calorie intake (presumably due to starch and fat) is directly due to coping with stress

Perhaps what I need is intermittent fasting or warrior diet. Go without starch/fat for 16H everyday.

--new: 2-sleep
consider sleeping 3am-9am (before kids start shouting), then afternoon nap.

Afternoon nap can be effective if I feel really sleepy.
