-- all my life the biggest calorie contributor is starch not fat or protein. 100% of my binges invole high starch, until recently when I started to cut down starch

-- the MLP monitor in Room2 can become a hindrance to the more-standing initiative. Detach it at times.

-- at Shangrila, I saw many white men (also some Asian men), mostly fathers in my age group.
Mostly affluent families, based on my guestimate and intuition.

However, they don't seem to have the highest level of wellness that I used to associate with white men.

My decade-long inferiority is now put into question.

In terms of brbr, I have reason to believe I'm in much better "shape". The same evening, I discussed the same topic with the LZ.Yu family. For some individuals, excess cash balance is like desserts left in a fridge... will disappear sooner or later.

-- new: the picnic basket (and wife's picnic food) is 
* high starch
* relatively high fat due to cheese, creams, baking oily/starchy
* very low amount of veg (less than 1% by weight)

It's error-prone to extrapolate. To me, most fancy foods, special occassion foods are tasty due to starch + fat. Raw veg is the least welcome feature.

In a way, the vast majority of people (in my familiar places) are attracted by foods high in starch, fat and sugar. Therefore, it requires daily battles and "personal strengths" (see my blogpost) to resist the temptations. 

In hindsight, I feel I ate too much starch even when not so tasty. In contrast, at LZ.Yu's dinner, I had very little starch, not even the corn

Wrong-time temptation .. I fought a good battle.
Wrong-quantity temptation .. can do better next time. My son was far more successful.
wrong-food temptation .. luckily I had my carrots. My son didn't like some of the starchy/oily foods and discard them after one byte. Good for him.


-- fuxi: knowing that BMI is not that critical when your nutiional mix is excellent, I still want to ask
Q: is it possible to put on weight by eating lots of carrots, and other raw veg + fruits?
A: I don't think so.

I think the amount of meat, starch and fat might be underestimated.

Cocacola and other beverage vendors have worked for decades to improve the appeal of sugar-free products.

I think most people still find those drinks inferior and not much better than water.

I think Colacola is trying to keep the customer hooked...

Most cusomers would buy the sugar-free version once a while, and buy the sugary version most of the time. The sugar-free version makes the customer less likely to detract.

-- fuxi: learn (on video) the basics of air-boxing to add fun to jogging. 

-- new or fuxi: many women are married to husbands who don't pay enough attention to flexibility.
Men are natually tighter.
I feel proud about my commitment (more than attitude) to flexibility. I think it's foresight.

-- new: yongTauFoo+salad as stress relief
now at a time of stress, sitting outside Koufu food court, I really need some comfort food, to help me calm down.

However, not really hungry. No craving for ice cream or oily/starchy stuff (in fact, small portion of these foods would likely trigger a craving for bigger portion.. valuable self knowledge.)

Salad with some comfort components (not raw veg alone) is a good choice. Yong Tau Foo is a soup version of salad since raw veg is not popular in Chinese diet. It costs $5 but buys me mild stress relief without the cCost (and guilt/self-hate).

Now, in some cases I still need some more substantial comfort food. The big "salad" as a huge appetizer tends to reduce its portion.

I have tried Ikea cafe food more than 10 times. I think it's slightly healthier than average. 
Obviously, at every restaurant, your personal choice of foods is the deciding factor. Ikea tends to offer more varieties of relatively healthy choices.

Still, I believe "reasonable" self-disciple in this context is simply insufficient. Your nutrional balance is probably reasonable, but there would be too much fat and insufficient vegetables. The overal c-cost would be too high.

I think most  attractive foods are similar. It's rare to find attractive yet healthy foods. 

--fuxi: stretch in shower: prefer sitting postures for safety.

-- fuxi: looking at my yoga classmates including many super-flexible women, I remind myself that they are probably unimpressive in fitness, balance, strength etc.

I realize my priorities are
1) BMI
2) cardio and muscle endurance
) strength
) flexibility
) power

So I feel my current position is superior and enviable compared to them.

--fuxi: when making smoothie, remember the risk of one contaminated ingredient spoiling the entire smoothie.
If you have some very decious or costly (time or $) then don't put too many other ingredients esp. if they could be unclean

-- fuxi: am becoming less tolerant of hunger sensation
-- fuxi: why no toothache in the last 10-20Y, basically not in SG /whereas/(not "while") I had them in China? 
No age pattern among the population.
So I guess I'm just lucky.

My dental care is one contributing factor including brushing and frequent checks.
--fuxi or new: bigger risk: too(much^little)nice food@home
I feel 80% of the risk is the too-much risk

In the too-little scenario (too little healthy comfort food at home), I could end up eating ice cream, or toast+peanut butter, or quick noodles, or peanuts

In Bayonne, I had too little food at home and I coped well.

--as I told boy...
when i face a wrong-* temptation outside home, I only need to say NO once. There's no wrong-qty temptation. The high price tag is a natural defense on my side.

when i face a wrong-* temptation at home, I need to say NO over and over. There's less wrong-food temptation. The 'soon-to-be-discarded' SMS is an enemy.

--fuxi: mix veg rice without rice
I could try this more. 
Without rice, I felt less guilty, more free

--fuxi:
how would LKY or a rich guy deal with the temptations of home cooking?

What if money is not an issue? i would live away from family for several days when my diet gets out of control.

Q: Can protein powder replace a meal?
With plenty of ice (chia seed is secondary) it did fill my stomach AND provide energy. However, the wrong-time temptation is overpowering. 
I think key is starch. Protein powder has no starch. If I have not tasted starch for a while, then it's hard. Try adding some cooked green beans, corn or rice

Q: how about red bean paste?
Let me say it again -- chia, ice, protein powder can provide a full meal, but if you have had no starch for a while, then the temptations simply wipe out everything and you can feel hungry (hedonic) again. This is the nature of our senses.
