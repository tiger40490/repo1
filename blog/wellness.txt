-- intercourse frequency .. is it correlated with overall wellness? Dr Lau pointed out perhaps family harmony is more important to my wellness.

I told Dr Lau that I have to accept lower frequency for two reasons
* wife's (lack of) support .. leads to conflicts.
* as i age, I depend on workout to maintain the frequency. If I reduce my workout, then I have to live with lower frequency.

-- heavy snacking, with lots of nuts -- not unhealthy, based on the data
in Jul 2021, I told Dr Lau I want to control this tendency.
-- New risk: Vitamin D below sufficient level
Supplement prescribed in 2021. I paid for two bottles but only took home one bottle due to expiry.

More sunshine would be good. Evening not much sunshine.
-- known risk: white blood cell
Not too worrisome. Some healthy people may have a different baseline than the population mean.

-- liver 
-- BMI
Please maintain muscle. It is more important than reducing BMI.

I told her I might lose muscle as I strive for lower BMI. She cautioned against it.As we age, we tend to lose muscle.

"Lose fat if you want, not muscle"

Consider 63 kg as a long-term target. Dr Lau agreed

-- late or irregular sleep
IFF you get enough sleep (Your body will tell you), then late sleep is not necessarily harmful. Look at shift workers.

Many times, my family members show me some research suggesting health hazards if your midnight hour like 12 to 2 is not spent sleeping. I feel such a research is one of the thousands of studies I don't completely believe. None of the published studies claim that shifting the sleep period has a definite health effect.

Actually my late sleep routine will end when I need to be in office 9am. Late sleep for a few months (or a few years) is not so dangerous.
-- non-risk: Yellowish skin is "definitely" due to food. (Genetics? not a reason.) She was confident. My carotene intake is probably much higher than the minimum, probably higher than "normal".

I told her I intend to increase intake to the extreme. She suggested widening the range of fruits and veg. More colorful diet. Consider steamed broccoli.
-- heel pain: To be effective, you need the expensive ($600+) professional insoles from a specialist foot doctor. She believed it's simpler and cheaper for me to buy proper branded running shoes.
-- cancer markers: Very few other cancer markers available. Next time can screen for lung cancer.
-- heart risk is rated low, even though I stressed my family history.
cholesterol medication: Actually no doctor ever said "It's OK to forget frequently."

Need better consistency like 1 Hypercol/day.

-- update 5/wk post:
For squat and stairs, we can incrementally build up a session.

-- update post on ICON screening
A mix of nuts is possibly better than peanuts alone.

Salmon, avocado, nuts are considered healthy fats if taken in moderation.

Muscle relaxation medicine has the least side effects. Take it only when needed.

Shift more focus from jogging to muscle maintenance as we age. I think x-training is best.

-- new: buying wellness: how effective@@
There are many "research" or marketing that link fancy new products to wellness. You would think the rich would live healthier lives? Alas, the correlation is very low.

I will use star-rating and dollar-rating ..
$$$*** more free time .. commute; lower-pay jobs
* less driving, more walking, cycling
* simple, low-cost workout equipmenets similar to what I now keep
$$* nearby gym/pool/basketballCourt/// as provided by an office or condo
$** yoga (and other) classes
$ fancy fruits

Note most of the cost-effective items are low-cost.

Note I consciously reject most of the supplements, fancy expensive food. 

$130/M gym fee is tolerable to me, but most of us use the gym only once a week. Let's assume 8 times/M

How about $16/visit flat rate? I would feel I could save the money by working out at home. 
Jolt: but can you do that consistently?

Paying the monthly fee motivates me to go there regularly.

-- new: challenge of chin-up target
A realistic goal would be one a day, but such a goal doens't generate positive feedback. 

I remember my yoga goal was one minute a day. I managed to change my perception to feel good about it.

For chin-up, I need the same change of perception.

-- fuxi
with squat, stairs, chin-up etc (mostly against body weight), even the slowest workout has a real intensity.

With boxing and jogging, slow means low intensity. Speed would easily tripple the intensity.

-- new: commercial^home cooking #quantity^quality
t_misperception

Critical thinking .. home cooking is better nutrition, but why my experience proved that my BMI was always better when living alone without home cooking? I would say quantity outweighs quality. 

quality of comercial food .. nowadays I buy more raw foods, less affected by inferior nutritional quality of commercial cooking. 
fast food .. is known for poor nutritional quality, but I seldom eat fast food when living alone.
home food still involves commercial cooked foods such as bakeries, ice creams
nuts .. as a group is never home-cooked. If I eat at home, the nuts in the home stash become unexpected and hazardous.
fish and meat .. perhaps home cooking is better quality, but by how many percent?
vegetables.. perhaps home cooking is better quality. Nowadays I tend to eat raw.
starch at home .. tend to be too enticing. The home stash has lots of outside starch food
starch bought outside .. tend to have more fiber, and stored in a stash under control
soymilk .. home-made is better, and I don't overeat.
milkshake .. home-made is better. 

-- new: compensation when coming home
when I come home, I look forward to (expectation of) a reward for the sacrifices, an unwinding of the strict control 
I feel I deserve some comfort food.

It feels too harsh to deny myself of the comfort foods.

Luckily I don't demand starch or fattty comfort foods. Fancy fruits are fine.

It is a sign of good appetite for relatively healthy foods. You don't want get rid of this appetite, do you? What you want to get rid of is the unexpected food
