--no blog: step back. Recognize that I don't really have a power surge for jogging 2 times in a row

i feel guilty for not going there but going has a tcost and an opportunity cost. Am not as efficient as I claim to be when scolding my son.

If I have the power surge I could simply work out in office or at home! 
Limiting factor is not time but absorbency

--new: jogging, not yoga, gives me the confidence that I can be avialble for my son for many years.
Basically cardio wellness is the main concern.

To a lesser extent, yoga also improve my long-term wellness.

jogging is a great wellness hobby. Compared to yoga, swimming etc, jogging routine is much more "flexible"  -- Requires fewer facilities, therefore, no timing restrictions when in the mood.
