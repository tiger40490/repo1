--yoga4life: everyday daily practice

.. frq and duration
Aim at 1 min/session, 5 sessions a week.
Longer sessions? not practical due to my current mentality
short sessions can be done anywhere
less frq? not so effective. 

.. easy vs hard poses
In Macq, I focused on only the hard poses and gave up within days. Now I want to usse easy ones.
Jess Lin said even the easy poses can be helpful. Jess said many easy poses can become harder when you focus on your form
Downward dog is best example

I would use mostly easy poses, and try hard ones only when motivated.

When you stop breathing (perhaps in the tough zone), your focus is off and you are no longer doing yoga.

.. how many poses?
Pick a few from a pool of 20 poses. There are more than 100 poses but I don't need to explore all.

.. yoga self practice^class
For lifelong practice, foundation has to be self practice. I can't always rely on the fancy facilities.. unsustainable.

Class can get me into the tougher zone and longer session. Classes can also reboot my routine.

--Q: am i improving in yoga
After talking to Jess Lin, I concluded that I'm improving compared to before yoga, even though I don't see it.

I told Jess that the improvement is mostly up here, pointing my finger at my head. The physical improvement will happen automatically over years and can be unnoticeable. The controlling factor is mental.

When on my flight I started sitting for hours with knees under armrest, I was improving.

When I engage in weekly practice, I am improving. Weekly is the minimum consistency to start the ball rolling. That's all in mind. On the body level, perhaps daily frequency is the minimum, but the real battle and real progress is mental.

Jess said even 1 minute a day of consistent practice is not easy.

When I realize the Grade-A flexible girls are not stronger than me and I'm not hopeless at yoga, I am improving.
When I no longer feel hopeless about my flexibility. I am improving. Hope is priceless. Confidence is precious.
When I no longer feel yoga is a useless waste of time as I used to say, I'm improving.
When I compare jogging with yoga and see my double-standard, I'm improving.
When I finally see a glimmer of hope that I could possibly practice yoga *consistently_for_life*, I'm improving.

Q: why so many beginners try yoga and give up?
A: many of my mental blocks were blocking them too. In fact, many of them can improve, over years, but they can't see beyond a few months.

All the improvements above are mental. Real battlefield is in the head. Rationality is winning. Yoga is winning.

"Mind-over-body". The body improvement will follow in due course.
--new: How yoga is different from stretching

I have a book on daily stretches..

Diff: yoga has a mental element and is classified as relaxation
Diff: yoga has a meditation element.
Diff: breathing is central to many if not all yoga practices
Diff: yoga poses have a balancing element.
Diff: In terms of goal, yoga is not so focused on reaching a particular range of motion. For me, I don't aim at that at all, though I may achieve that as a by-product.
Diff: hard stretch for athletes and dancers often feel like painful tortures. I now believe yoga should NEVER feel torturous. You need effort, not brute force willpower.
Diff: yoga is more gentle, and accessible to everyone
Diff: yoga doesn't use equipment. Some people can use a towel and a block

--xp
eating lots of fruits + veg even when not hungry didn't add to my weight.

I feel starch, fat and perhaps protein add to my weight.

Fish? Not sure

milk? not sure

--## easy stretches I can do any time, even at home
* lotus on sofa
* downward dog

--fuxi: 
sugar + fat + salt is the common description of modern processed food.

For me the killer combo is starch + fat + sugar, in that order.

--fuxi: the pizzahut experience

I couldn't stick to my rule "no food if not hungry". I decided to break my rule but I fought a Baoshan war :

* chia seeds ... added to mushroom soup 
* cabbage + onion ... added to pizza
* I ordered the veg soup instead of mushroom soup

Every small decision counts. I feel proud of myself.

--new (jolt): yoyo diet != trivial
The "relax" phase must not become too unconstrained, otherwise the tight-belt phase will become too hard too long, to slowly get rid of the excesses. 

Therefore, if a yoyo diet actually reduces weight without serious side effects, it is rather effective and successful.

Nothing to laugh at.

If you laugh at yoyo diet, just try to reduce your own weight. You will realize how damn hard it is.

--fuxi: for stable cholesterol level, one test per year is good enough. 
Remember to include full blood count

--new: yoga is strategic
Yoga is somewhat strategic to my current lifestyle, as I could feel the physical "decline" more often

In contrast, BMI, cardio .. are more likely to be strategic.

However, yoga Can (not could, not merely in-theory) have a slow, long-term effect on my mental + physical health.
Regular yoga can possibly help some mild hypertension patients. I think breathing and meditation are relevant.
it can help me learn to relax
it helps me open myself to a proven method of relaxation.
It can slowly build my self-confidence that I could overcome something really hard.
It can slowly build my self-esteem that I could keep working on a really serious weakness, almost like a handicap, like stammer.

To a lesser extent, starch reduction has a similar effect on my self-confidence and long-term lifestyle benefit

--fuxi: nutrient timing is invented for ultra-endurance athletes. The reserach findings are not directly applicable to the ordinary people.
--fuxi when it comes to calorie counting, One of the least noticed math features is
various degrees of "bad" when we decide to loosen up and eat bad food
I feel creamy cakes are among the worst, but for most people, it is probably impractical to completely avoid creamy foods as if they were opium. Various degree of bad -- fried peanut and alcohol are both worse than creamy.. tobacco is worst than alcohol and drugs are worse than tobacco. 

In the mass media, we can see the different attitudes towards different categories of "bad" foods

More stupid are the calorie-dense foods that aren't satisfying -- fried peanuts; alcohol; mint ice-cream; cheese chunks; 

--fuxi: yoga or jogging [1] can interfere with my xx/codingDrill, boy's math, work laser ...

[1] swimming is more time consuming.

mini-exercise is less interference

--fuxi: wellness review on bizclass flight
* salad very healthy, without dressing. I at the more salad today than any day over last 6M
* three servings of fruits
* rice I didn't eat up, better than before
* some stretching
* plenty of water
* moderate red wine for heart health
* restraint on cakes, chocolate, ice cream etc, not as unconstrained as before 
* before the flight, I did eat lots of fruits + radish

--fuxi: luxury, medically unnecessary -- these commercial offerings are effective for some athletes or patients, but not clinically proven to be nearly as effective as medicines
* skincare products
* hair treatments
* most MLM supplements
* meal timing
