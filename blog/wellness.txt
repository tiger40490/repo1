Consider a heart-beat monitor if you run very fast.

If all tests are clear, then perhaps the tests were insensitive and insufficient. 

Q: competitive running/jogging .. fall at the end? Yes dangerous to the heart
AA: Aim at endurance and don't sprint. Maintain pace. 
%%A: My younger-day habit of sprint in the last lap is no longer safe at my age

I tend to use my running performance as a guage of my aging, but we don't need to feel bad about performance decline.

Q: 20km hard running?
%%A: 20km is fine 

Prof Lee of NUS .. death after a run

-- fuxi: Henry Lew suggestions:
Sugg 1: After seeing the home-cooked dinner, allocate a fixed portion for the night. Do not keep eating beyond that. 

Sugg 1b: Reduce allocation by 20%. The body and mind may not notice it.

Sugg 2: pre-emptive compensation .. Predict "night time compensation". If positive, then eat some starch (or whatever enticing food) before going home.
Then at home reduce the "allocation" by the pre-comp amount.

Sugg 3: when the craving starts, locate the part of the body. Then locate another part of the body that's comfortable. That makes a pair. Breathe in to the craving part, and breathe out to the comfort part.

Q: since what age did you start to notice appetite out of control
%%A: definitely before 30. Whenever I try to control my appetite, I would often find it hard to control.

Psychological inflexibility .. the behavior + the feeling follows one direction, but the control [self2 judge] is steering towards another direction. Conflict and loss of control. These negative consequences are not necessary. Controlled release/surrender can be beneficial.

enviable BMI can come at disproportionate cost
* Older adults often need to fight, on their back heels, an uphill battle to retain muscles. Losing muscle can reduce your BMI but it also affects your metabolism rate
* amputation can reduce your BMI, but do you want that?
