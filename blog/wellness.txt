--new jolt: wellness to receive more attention....
for a few years (2018-2019) I valued wellness higher relative to FOMO, benchmark exams, wealth ...
Now in mid 2020, wellness is again taking a backseat. 

How do I change my perception and belief to get wellness /restored to its rightful place/? I may need to consciously downplay the other preoccupations.

Q: after a yoga/pull-up/diet/bmi improvemenet, how do I derive the same positive feeling (like pride) as derived from an investment success or job offer?

“high levels of physical activity seem to be very important for maintenance of lost weight, HIGH as more than an hour of exercise daily."

"Exercise helps keep lost pounds off, but exercise alone can’t do the initial job of losing it."

"To exercise your way out of overeating is impossible."

"To be sure, some people can work weight off, experts say. These include those who exercise vigorously for long periods, and professional athletes, who typically engage in high-intensity workouts. But they are the exceptions. Those high-level workouts are 'not something most people' "

--new: weight-loss supplements: questionable
https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/metabolism/art-20046508 claims

"As you get older, the amount of muscle tends to decrease and fat accounts for more of your weight, slowing down calorie burning."

"Aerobic exercise is the most efficient way to burn calories and includes activities such as walking, bicycling and swimming. As a general goal, include at least 30 minutes of physical activity in your daily routine."

Strength training exercises at least twice a week. Strength training is important because it helps counteract muscle loss associated with aging. And since muscle tissue burns more calories than fat tissue does, even at rest, muscle mass is a key factor in weight loss.

"Don't look to dietary supplements for help in burning calories or weight loss." Manufacturer may cite clinical trials and claim "98%" effective, but the statistics are often weak and flawed. They may use the most obese individuals whose weight fluctuate a lot.
