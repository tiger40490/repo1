In Dec 2023 I started to worry about quality_of_life in my mom's twilight years, either in a Beijing nursing home, or a Singapore nursing home, or living with my wife (while I'm away in the U.S.), gainst the backdrop of her declining health.

This is another side of VV (one of the trio).

All the scenarios appear pathetic, unappealing, scary,,, As people grow old, they are bound to experience (some or all of) mobility decline, mental decline, living away from immediate family, or outside their own comfortable home. Inevitable for many in their 80s and beyond. 

Given an elderly's health, financial and family situation, his choices are often limited. If money is not the problem (willing suspension of disbelief), then perhaps he can live with family + adequate healthcare at home [R.Teo's dad?]. Hopefully (big hope), the in-law caregivers are able to cope, supported by plenty of external resources. This "acceptable" bar is too high to be realistic.

Before I can plan ahead, I have to give up on unrealistic expectations.

How about my ADL insurance? I now feel somewhat more vindicated. 

The more children and grandchildren I have, the more resources I have available in my old age.

My depression is about coping (and making peace) with aging. 

My aging is kind of gathering pace, and I think it will accelerate. Gradually I will lose physical and some mental capacities. 
I will adjust to it, even though adjustment can be stressful, painful, frustrating,,,

Hba1c is slightly more accurate than FPG. For future blood tests, include both.

Q: some sites classify 5.6% as prediatetic? 
A: 5.5% vs 5.6% is insignificant difference in Hba1c. Nutritional adjustment should be enough to restore 5.5%
A: If really worried, then reduce carbs as a long-term lifestyle improvement.

-- Henry Lew suggestions:
Sugg 1: After seeing the home-cooked dinner, allocate a fixed portion for the night. Do not keep eating beyond that. 

Sugg 1b: Reduce allocation by 20%. The body and mind may not notice it.

Sugg 2: pre-emptive compensation .. Predict "night time compensation". If positive, then eat some starch (or whatever enticing food) before going home .. pre-emptive compensation.
Then at home reduce the "allocation" by the pre-comp amount.

Sugg 3: when the craving starts, locate the part of the body. Then locate another part of the body that's comfortable. That makes a pair. Breathe in to the craving part, and breathe out to the comfort part.

Q: since what age did you start to notice appetite out of control
%%A: definitely before 30. Whenever I try to control my appetite, I would often find it hard to control.

Psychological inflexibility .. the behavior + the feeling follows one direction, but the control [self2 judge] is steering towards another direction. Conflict and loss of control. The neg consequences are not necessary. Controlled release/surrender can be beneficial.

Simplest, sustainable exericse?

-- update which one?
I attended UrbanDen(beneath CIMB) yoga class with 20 other students, the first big yoga class in a year.
Some of the students near my mat were, like deja vu, so flexible as to put me to shame. 

.. Sinking feeling. 
If you have been working out on CRE, strength, etc but neglected flexibility, you are bound to hit a sinking feeling .. left behind.

Quality of life.

Suppose you go to a developing country where everyone you see is slim, mobile, able-bodied, and flexible, you may hit a sinking feeling like -- In the grand scheme of things, how valuable is your net worth?
Concrete example -- YY.Tao has an enviable net worth, but complained about his knee condition. As we age, such conditions are less likely to improve and recover.

BMI can come at disproportionate cost
* Older adults often need to fight, on their back heels, an uphill battle to keep muscles. Losing muscle can reduce your BMI but it also affects your metabolism rate
* amputation can reduce your BMI, but do you want that?

What foods have the biggest (PCA) impact based on observation and personal research? I don't have verifiable data. Established calorie science is highly imperfect in my experience.
A: Starch, hidden fat, nuts, not fruits, not milk
