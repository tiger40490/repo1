-- fuxi: dental review at Nuffield RaffP
dental care is mostly about pain prevention.

overall good condition. No majorproblem including inter-dental. Dr S attributed it to "good diet". An earlier dentist (Russell?) attributed it to saliva quality.

Seeking a variety of professional opinions .. plausible not unnecessary. It does requries financial support, so I'm grateful to MLP.

flossing .. I have better habits now than 3Y ago. Dr S felt flossette can be fairly effective cf floss

Plaque needs effort. Dr S said 6M recheck is fine, but I like more frequent

Extreme ends of lower arc needs special flossing

Some inflamation at some /gumline/ areas

-- low fat salad dressing .. usually has harmful ingredients
Looks like only homemade low-fat dressing is safer

-- new: dementia: G5 modifiable risk factors
I doubt there's consensus about the ranking among these items, so I will "mix in" what I know about my environment and self-knowledge.

Here are some of the modifiable risk factors. Note age and genetics are not modifiable.
smoking and alcohol .. G3 factor
cardio::LDL cholesterol.. G3 factor
diabetes .. a G7 factor
cardio::hypertension .. G9 for me
overweight .. G9 for me
chronic sleep problem? G5
isolation? G5 IMO. I think going out of your lonely home helps. Mobility impairment may become a contributing factor.
hearing loss .. G7 factor

I think this is a good motivator, given that my mom mentions dementia frequently.

-- fuxi: BMI is no longer the primary, dominent control factor. 
I feel gastritis is a key factor

-- fuxi: Henry Lew suggestions:
Sugg 1: After seeing the home-cooked dinner, allocate a fixed portion for the night. Do not keep eating beyond that. 

Sugg 1b: Reduce allocation by 20%. The body and mind may not notice it.

Sugg 2: pre-emptive compensation .. Predict "night time compensation". If positive, then eat some starch (or whatever enticing food) before going home.
Then at home reduce the "allocation" by the pre-comp amount.

Sugg 3: when the craving starts, locate the part of the body. Then locate another part of the body that's comfortable. That makes a pair. Breathe in to the craving part, and breathe out to the comfort part.

Q: since what age did you start to notice appetite out of control
%%A: definitely before 30. Whenever I try to control my appetite, I would often find it hard to control.

Psychological inflexibility .. the behavior + the feeling follows one direction, but the control [self2 judge] is steering towards another direction. Conflict and loss of control. These negative consequences are not necessary. Controlled release/surrender can be beneficial.

-- fuxi or update which one?
I attended UrbanDen(beneath CIMB) yoga class with 20 other students, the first big yoga class in a year.
Some of the students near my mat were, like deja vu, so flexible as to put me to shame. 

.. Sinking feeling. 
If you have been working out on CRE, strength, etc but neglected flexibility, you are bound to hit a sinking feeling .. left behind.

Quality of life.

Suppose you go to a developing country where everyone you see is slim, mobile, able-bodied, and flexible, you may hit a sinking feeling like -- In the grand scheme of things, how valuable is your net worth?
Concrete example -- YY.Tao has an enviable net worth, but complained about his knee condition. As we age, such conditions are less likely to improve and recover.

-- fuxi: 
kimchi .. healthy in reasonable amounts
sweet fruits .. very healthy but some dietes risk if really high amount
alcohol.. healthy in very small amounts
nuts .. heart-healthy in small amounts only

-- fuxi or update bpost on bone/muscles
enviable BMI can come at disproportionate cost
* Older adults often need to fight, on their back heels, an uphill battle to retain muscles. Losing muscle can reduce your BMI but it also affects your metabolism rate
* amputation can reduce your BMI, but do you want that?

What foods have the biggest (PCA) impact based on observation and personal research? I don't have verifiable data. Established calorie science is highly imperfect in my experience.
A: Starch, hidden fat, nuts, not fruits, not milk
