--new: if i can tolerate the extreme form of diet  and celebrate it explicitly, then I develop a negative perception of the less extreme yet worthwhile endeavors

Eg: raw celery and carrot without any dressing
Eg: Sat morning yoga on hard surface .. is extreme, and when I decide to go realYoga studio I felt like a weakling
Eg: no movie for a year .. is extreme. When I decide to use movie as a reward I hear a zsms

--new: cooked child veg dish that don't need any starch (not too salty) is good. 

no need to reheat

Can freeze.

--new: slowly get into the habit of eating/buying small packet of nuts. This is based on an honest assessment of my limited self-restraint
