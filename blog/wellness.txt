many friends warn me that home cooking use far "healthier" food than commercial cooking.

raw food is safest!

For me, biggest problem is wrong time and wrong quantity, not wrong nutrition

--update blogpost on wrong-time temptation
"wrong time" is such a prevalent problem in SG (U.S. is costlier and less convenient). It is a problem even at food court, but the $$cost requires me to choose only one meal. The cost makes me slow down and think.

With home meal there's no speed bump! So we have to exercise self-constraint which is tough for most of us.

--new strategy against the starchy foods from grandma
eat lots of veg + fruits + milkshake
