Rahul was very determined and in-control, but he might be slightly overweight.

Many of my colleagues are overweight. I tend to assume they have poor control over diet or exercise, but I could be very wrong. 

Some slim individuals are not really better at self-control. I guess they are just lucky.

This "control" is central to successZ, but if our "system" is hard to control, then I think we need harmony. See the bpost on serenity

The western food culture depends on cheese so much that the media is unable to portray cheese as a fattening

-- update bpost on 5/wk
Is my 5/wk sustainable long-term like 3y?

my 5/wk routine is the /exemplification/ of successZ, and really tough except during a few weeks when I'm motivated and confident. (However, such a power surge "honeymoon" rarely lasts a month.)

Most adults (like 98%) after leaving school/army and before retirement would find it really tough. (Servicemen and Pre-college students are different because they have physical training + fitness tests.)
In their views, which type of workout of this bpost is most frequently questioned as too light? 
A: skiprope, squat... but "their view" is based on popular perception only.

In my own view which workout is most frequently questioned as too light?
A: skiprope, stairs

Frequency is the key and also the real challenge. To maintain frequency, I increase variety, and incorporate incentives.

when people say avocado, nuts, salman...are good for slimming, and backed by research, they mean "better than the mainstream junk foods".

If you are already on healthy diet, then the foods above could be less healthy than your current diet!
