--fuxi
now vs 2019, my bmi is worse due to 4kg, even though
* i have maintained my starch abstinence and veg/fruit + milkshake
* I have maintained my meal delay
* I have maintained to some extent intermittent fasting

I may have to accept status quo for now and keep working on BMI

--running shoes
buy some good quality but modest running shoes, before buying a specialized insole 

TPY should be good enough. No time to visit somewhere far

I guess stadium is better than hard surface.
