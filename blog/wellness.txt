-- new: bullied by shop assistants
A little more love for my still-intact heart... Frequent anger can affect blood pressure. My heart rate actually went up when confronting the bully. We get a burst of energy. If this happens often, it causes wear and tear on your artery walls. Research backs that up.

State your demnad like 'I hope you can accept your fault, and learn a lesson.' If the salesperson refuses, then at least I made my demand.

Speak slowly and avoid raising your voice.

Avoid attacking, which tends to invite counter-attacks and dangerous escalation of tension.

The salesperson is often young, untrained, and doing the job relunctantly.

2min twice a day .. emphasizing interval , rather than thoroughness.

I have to agree that long interval is a proven hazard in my personal experience

However, I practice a schedule modified for thoroughness. My minimum frequency is 7 times a week, consist of 1 or 2 flossings and 5 or 6 brushings. Each flossing session is often focused on a subset of teeth, so over a month, each teeth would receive some deep cleaning.

I often feel guilty about 7/week but it has worked reasonably well for me.

kimchi .. healthy in reasonable amounts, but now I worry about the sodium content
red wine.. healthy in very small amounts
nuts .. heart-healthy in small amounts only
70%+ dark chocolate ..  healthy in very small amounts

-- fuxi: Henry Lew suggestions:
Sugg 1: After seeing the home-cooked dinner, allocate a fixed portion for the night. Do not keep eating beyond that. 

Sugg 1b: Reduce allocation by 20%. The body and mind may not notice it.

Sugg 2: pre-emptive compensation .. Predict "night time compensation". If positive, then eat some starch (or whatever enticing food) before going home.
Then at home reduce the "allocation" by the pre-comp amount.

Sugg 3: when the craving starts, locate the part of the body. Then locate another part of the body that's comfortable. That makes a pair. Breathe in to the craving part, and breathe out to the comfort part.

Q: since what age did you start to notice appetite out of control
%%A: definitely before 30. Whenever I try to control my appetite, I would often find it hard to control.

Psychological inflexibility .. the behavior + the feeling follows one direction, but the control [self2 judge] is steering towards another direction. Conflict and loss of control. These negative consequences are not necessary. Controlled release/surrender can be beneficial.

I attended UrbanDen(beneath CIMB) yoga class with 20 other students, the first big yoga class in a year.

Concrete example -- YY.Tao has an enviable net worth, but complained about his knee condition. As we age, such conditions are less likely to improve and recover.

enviable BMI can come at disproportionate cost
* Older adults often need to fight, on their back heels, an uphill battle to retain muscles. Losing muscle can reduce your BMI but it also affects your metabolism rate
* amputation can reduce your BMI, but do you want that?
