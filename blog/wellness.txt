-- knowing that BMI is not that critical when your nutiional mix is excellent, I still want to ask
Q: is it possible to put on weight by eating lots of carrots, and other raw veg + fruits?
A: I don't think so.

I think the amount of meat, starch and fat might be underestimated.
 
-- update blogpost: yellowish skin: another doctor also felt confident it is due to food. He reassured me it's harmless.

-- learn (on video) the basics of air-boxing to add fun to jogging. 

-- new or fuxi: many women are married to husbands who don't pay enough attention to flexibility.
Men are natually tighter.
I feel proud about my commitment (more than attitude) to flexibility. I think it's foresight.

-- new: yongTauFoo+salad as stress relief
now at a time of stress, sitting outside Koufu food court, I really need some comfort food, to help me calm down.

However, not really hungry. No craving for ice cream or oily/starchy stuff (in fact, small portion of these foods would likely trigger a craving for bigger portion.. valuable self knowledge.)

Salad with some comfort components (not raw veg alone) is a good choice. Yong Tau Foo is a soup version of salad since raw veg is not popular in Chinese diet. It costs $5 but buys me mild stress relief without the cCost (and guilt/self-hate).

Now, in some cases I still need some more substantial comfort food. The big "salad" as a huge appetizer tends to reduce its portion.

I have tried Ikea cafe food more than 10 times. I think it's slightly healthier than average. 
Obviously, at every restaurant, your personal choice of foods is the deciding factor. Ikea tends to offer more varieties of relatively healthy choices.

Still, I believe "reasonable" self-disciple in this context is simply insufficient. Your nutrional balance is probably reasonable, but there would be too much fat and insufficient vegetables. The overal c-cost would be too high.

I think most  attractive foods are similar. It's rare to find attractive yet healthy foods. 

--fuxi: stretch in shower: prefer sitting postures for safety.

-- fuxi: looking at my yoga classmates including many super-flexible women, I remind myself that they are probably unimpressive in fitness, balance, strength etc.

I realize my priorities are
1) BMI
2) cardio and muscle endurance
) strength
) flexibility
) power

So I feel my current position is superior and enviable compared to them.

--fuxi: when making smoothie, remember the risk of one contaminated ingredient spoiling the entire smoothie.
If you have some very decious or costly (time or $) then don't put too many other ingredients esp. if they could be unclean

-- fuxi: am becoming less tolerant of hunger sensation
-- fuxi: why no toothache in the last 10-20Y, basically not in SG /whereas/(not "while") I had them in China? 
No age pattern among the population.
So I guess I'm just lucky.

My dental care is one contributing factor including brushing and frequent checks.
--fuxi or new: bigger risk: too(much^little)nice food@home
I feel 80% of the risk is the too-much risk

In the too-little scenario (too little healthy comfort food at home), I could end up eating ice cream, or toast+peanut butter, or quick noodles, or peanuts

In Bayonne, I had too little food at home and I coped well.

--as I told boy...
when i face a wrong-* temptation outside home, I only need to say NO once. There's no wrong-qty temptation. The high price tag is a natural defense on my side.

when i face a wrong-* temptation at home, I need to say NO over and over. There's less wrong-food temptation. The 'soon-to-be-discarded' SMS is an enemy.

--fuxi: mix veg rice without rice
I could try this more. 
Without rice, I felt less guilty, more free

--fuxi:
how would LKY or a rich guy deal with the temptations of home cooking?

What if money is not an issue? i would live away from family for several days when my diet gets out of control.

Q: Can protein powder replace a meal?
With plenty of ice (chia seed is secondary) it did fill my stomach AND provide energy. However, the wrong-time temptation is overpowering. 
I think key is starch. Protein powder has no starch. If I have not tasted starch for a while, then it's hard. Try adding some cooked green beans, corn or rice

Q: how about red bean paste?
Let me say it again -- chia, ice, protein powder can provide a full meal, but if you have had no starch for a while, then the temptations simply wipe out everything and you can feel hungry (hedonic) again. This is the nature of our senses.
