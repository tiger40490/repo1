thick condom reduces pleasure but prolongs intimacy .. net positive.

The ring can be too tight. If not too tight, then the discomfort vs the duration enhancement is net positive.

I attended UrbanDen yoga class with 20 other students, the first big yoga class in a year.
Some of the students near my mat were, like deja vu, so flexible as to put me to shame. 
Sinking feeling. 

If you have been working out on CRE, strength, etc but neglected flexibility, you are bound to hit a sinking feeling .. left behind.

Quality of life.

Suppose you go to a developing country where everyone you see is slim, mobile, able-bodied, and flexible, you may hit a sinking feeling like -- In the grand scheme of things, how valuable is your net worth?
Concrete example -- YY.Tao has an enviable net worth, but complained about his knee condition. As we age, such conditions are less likely to improve and recover.

BMI can come at disproportionate cost
* Older adults often need to fight, on their back heels, an uphill battle to keep muscle. Losing muscle can reduce your BMI but it also affects your metabolism rate
* amputation can reduce your BMI, but do you want that?
* Losing your healthy appetite, and becoming someone like grandpa in his late 80s, can reduce your BMI, but do you want that?
* During my covid infection, I lost appetite and BMI, but it is not worth it.

If BMI improvement affect my intimacy, then let go of the BMI. My intimacy is more important.

sexual gratification (actually, longer active sex life) is sometimes more important to me than improving BMI to 64 kg

BMI helps my CRE and chin-up, but those things are far less important than deep-green.

BMI is more important than early sleep, but early sleep probably helps my diet.

-- limitations of calorie theory:
meal replacement powders

chia and other resistant starch .. can make me feel full for a while. Some lose the satiety effect soon :( Some actuall make me gain weight. So the calorie theory is inconssitent, confusing,,,

nuts .. very high cal density ... too high to believe

juices or whole milk is supposed to provide lots of calories, but I don't feel full 

--new: control over BMI ... or update post on passive acceptance
Rahul was very determined and in-control, but he might be slightly overweight.

Many of my colleagues are overweight. I tend to assume they have poor control over diet or exercise, but I could be very wrong. 

Some slim individuals are not really better at self-control. I guess they are just lucky.

This "control" is central to successZ, but if our "system" is hard to control, then I think we need harmony. See the bpost on serenity
