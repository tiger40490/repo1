--when it comes to calorie counting, One of the least noticed math features is
various degrees of "bad" when we decide to loosen up and eat bad food
I feel creamy cakes are among the worst.

More stupid are the calorie dense foods that aren't satisfying -- fried peanuts; alcohol; mint ice-cream; cheese chunks; 

--raw veg salad that my family can prepare for me
* pepper
* onion
* radish
* cucumber
* tomato
* chia
* fruits
* cooked carrot
* egg white
* crab meat
* chicken breast
? nuts and cheese? defeats the purpose

--new: the girl with A-grade flexibility (my grade? ...) 
may not be able to make a living as a yoga instructor
may not derive satisfaction and self-esteem from her superior flexibility
may be poor in balancing, strength and endurance (consider endurance sports)
is probably not going to win in any yoga competition, but why bother with competition? So why feel inferior to them?

--real cost of a yoga session
(great eg of git blogging beating web blogging!) 
$cost is trivial cf the other costs

By far the biggest cost is mental energy. I need to really persuade myself.

Another big cost is tcost. Commute, ..

Therefore, I would not worry about going in 5 min late.

--Make appt with Dr Colin Ong during lunch time?
I should this month, but no hurry

--update blogpost: nut oil is very different from animal fats

--new: weight-loss theories: conflicting evidence
even if i eat lots of fruits, meat and low starch, i could still put on weight
I may need to accept it. Calorie theory breakdown?
Perhaps see an expert dietitian?

More imp -- avoid eating when not hungry

There are many diverging opinions on calorie restriction and weight loss. Even the scientists disagree, with conflicting evidence. If you are serious about weight loss, you must choose what to believe. Here are a few pillar beliefs I choose to hold tight.
* my personal safe BMI is 18.5. A good summary is the letter to Susan Lee, but I have many blog posts under t_j4slim, written from different angles.
* raw vegetables are safe .. can eat as much as I like; most fruits are safe, even if sweet. The starchy fruits are not tasty and I won't eat too much anyway.
* home cooked vegetables are safe. Can eat with a bit of starch
* it's tough but safe to reduce oily and starchy food towards zero
* I don't worry about malnutrition as I do eat non-trivial amount of starch + fat 
* protein powder is generally safe

The calorie theory on weight loss is a life-science theory, not a physical science theory, so there are many exceptions.

--new: no stress no gain
BMI, diet, yoga, workout ... demand mental effort, focus and stress. 

A bullet fired towards a target is in free motion... hit or miss, but for a missile to aim at a moving target and adjust its flight, control is required.
As soon as we set an (however vague) expectation and take aim, we take on a challenge and set ourself up for stress.

Our self-esteem is now at stake.

Similarly the coding drill...

My son may not have this self-control yet.

--Singapore residents enjoy more workout facilities, mostly free. 
iFF they do use the facilities, then the national health would surely improve, in terms of mental health, sleep, appetite, freedom from illness, medical cost, 
This is arguably the most essential ingredient of quality of life in a country

--fuxi: wellness review on bizclass flight
* salad very healthy, without dressing. I at the more salad today than any day over last 6M
* three servings of fruits
* rice I didn't eat up, better than before
* some stretching
* plenty of water
* moderate red wine for heart health
* restraint on cakes, chocolate, ice cream etc, not as unconstrained as before 
* before the flight, I did eat lots of fruits + radish

--fuxi: protein smoothie
Most of the "marketing" and taste-enhancers are sugary, as majority of these consumers react to sugar.
Many sugary ingredients contain preservatives.

--new: primer on fatty foods
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good is a good overview with examples.

I tend to treat most fatty foods as equals .. unwise :(

Trans fats have no known health benefits and there is no safe level of consumption. Therefore, they have been officially banned in the United States

Saturated fats are common in the American diet. They are solid at room temperature and show up in red meat, whole milk and other whole-milk dairy foods including cheese.

Healthy fats are liquid at room temperature, not solid. There are two broad categories of beneficial fats: monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.

Good sources of monounsaturated fats are olive oil, avocados, and most nuts including peanuts. They are still calorie-dense.
