--new: filling foods may(not)add weight.
Starchy root plants like potato, yam .. do feel very filling. I FEEL (and believe) they are fattening to many people including me, but in reality, perhaps their dietary fiber pass through my system without adding to my weight? My personal experience proves otherwise.

Various nuts feel very filling. I FEEL they are fattening, but in reality, the overall quantity I eat tends to add to way below half the amount of starchy foods. 

In theory, these filling foods could reduce the hunger/craving, but in me, the hunger would come back within 3 hours. 
I have concluded from decades of self-observation that the hunger depends 99% on the availability of foods i.e. temptation.

So far, most satisfying foods do add weight to MY system, except a few precious items
* protein smoothie
* melons, grapes, 

Chia seeds are filling but not satisfying. I FEEL they aren't fattening at all.

--jolt
perhaps ice cream is not as fattening as feared. I think ice cream with chia could provide fiber, water, ..

--new: yoga: too easy^hard
yoga is much harder than jogging.

As I told Rahul, I am unable to find a mid point between

* too tough, painful, ... to practice on my own
* too easy and no effect, wasting my time.

In fact, in both cases I fail to see any lasting improvement. Promethean torment.

I think i need a way to measure the result and my progress. 
How about jogging? Gr8 question!

many dieters feel hopeless about cutting down one cake because the next meal would see a wipe-out of this "improvement". 
If you believe the temptation is always bigger than your resolve, then you would feel hopeless fighting it.

In reality, every successful dieter started by cutting down one cake. 

We slowly change our diet habits and combat the temptation. The temptation is not always bigger than us. We are not doomed.

--all of the efforts in calorie restriction, weight mgmt... has one key obstacle -- hunger

The sensation of hunger is complex.

Fiber, protein, chia seeds, ... all target hunger

--new: creamy cake=worse than ice cream
chia seeds are easy to add into ice cream
ice cream has lots of water content, therefore less calorie dense.
cakes has starch + fat

--new: is sweet fruit less healthy than veg@@
For me, the fruit sugar is not addictive and not adding to my weight. 

The only reason I prefer raw veg is that they is less palatable and trains my "system"

--the pizzahut experience

I couldn't stick to my rule "no food if not hungry". I decided to break my rule but I fought a Baoshan war :

* chia seeds ... added to mushroom soup 
* cabbage + onion ... added to pizza
* I ordered the veg soup instead of mushroom soup

Every small decision counts. I feel proud of myself.

--new (jolt): yoyo diet != trivial
The "relax" phase must not become too unconstrained, otherwise the tight-belt phase will become too hard too long, to slowly get rid of the excesses. 

Therefore, if a yoyo diet actually reduces weight without serious side effects, it is rather effective and successful.

Nothing to laugh at.

If you laugh at yoyo diet, just try to reduce your own weight. You will realize how damn hard it is.

--fuxi: Now I think I could reach lower BMI, deeper green if I simply delay meals as much as possible. 

Temptation is the real key. No temptation, suffering.

I need to reward myself with fancy fruits + protein powder milkshake

--fuxi: for stable cholesterol level, one test per year is good enough. 
Remember to include full blood count

--fuxi: calorie is not everything for my son, but is the most important factor
For a weight watcher, It's already very hard if you are able to focus on calorie restriction. Now if you get distracted by other confusing messages like "good fat", it will be even harder.

--fuxi: 
Yoga is not strategic to my current lifestyle. In contrast, BMI, endurance are more strategic as I could feel the physical "decline" more often

However, yoga Can (not could, not merely in-theory) have a slow, long-term effect on my mental + physical health.
it can help me learn to relax
it helps me open myself to a proven method of relaxation.
It can slowly build my self-confidence that I could overcome something really hard.
It can slowly build my self-esteem that I could keep working on a really serious weakness, almost like a handicap, like stammer.

To a lesser extent, starch reduction has a similar effect on my self-confidence and long-term lifestyle benefit

9 "stubborn" diet HABITS ranked in terms of impact on my long-term health

:) don't eat if not hungry, even when everyone is eating. My parents and in-laws believed we should all eat at the same time. Some people eat dinner early and don't feel hungry at night, but my body is different
:( heavy supper
:) self-restraint on oily, fried food , despite my nature
:) skip breakfast + lunch
:) delayed dinner
:) raw veg salad to break starch dependency
:( heavy afternoon snacks of nuts, starch ..
:) spot the visible fat. I believe every tidbit counts. I hate paying such high calorie "price" to gain basically nothing.
:) no coffee or sugary drink habit, despite peer influence 
:( cake-history buns once a day -- once formed, this habit was hard to break

--fuxi: nutrient timing is invented for ultra-endurance athletes. The reserach findings are not directly applicable to the ordinary people.
--fuxi when it comes to calorie counting, One of the least noticed math features is
various degrees of "bad" when we decide to loosen up and eat bad food
I feel creamy cakes are among the worst, but for most people, it is probably impractical to completely avoid creamy foods as if they were opium. Various degree of bad -- fried peanut and alcohol are both worse than creamy.. tobacco is worst than alcohol and drugs are worse than tobacco. 

In the mass media, we can see the different attitudes towards different categories of "bad" foods

More stupid are the calorie-dense foods that aren't satisfying -- fried peanuts; alcohol; mint ice-cream; cheese chunks; 

--fuxi: yoga or jogging [1] can interfere with my xx/codingDrill, boy's math, work laser ...

[1] swimming is more time consuming.

mini-exercise is less interference

--fuxi: wellness review on bizclass flight
* salad very healthy, without dressing. I at the more salad today than any day over last 6M
* three servings of fruits
* rice I didn't eat up, better than before
* some stretching
* plenty of water
* moderate red wine for heart health
* restraint on cakes, chocolate, ice cream etc, not as unconstrained as before 
* before the flight, I did eat lots of fruits + radish

--fuxi: luxury, medically unnecessary -- these commercial offerings are effective for some athletes or patients, but not clinically proven to be nearly as effective as medicines
* skincare products
* hair treatments
* most MLM supplements
* meal timing
