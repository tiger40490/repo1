among y favorite ice cream flavors are sweet corn and red bean.

My favorite salad is potato salad.

starch is a bigge feature in my "system" than other people's system. 

Therefore, my starch abstinence is harder and more remarkable.

for both my son and me, buying unhealthy food without eating is vastly better than taking the same free food, and eating

The "role model" of the guy who ran 70 miles on his 70th birthday has a negative impact on me.

It made me feel worthless, weak, guilty ... even though I'm more determined than most people.

jogging near office has a huge advantage -- other joggers and tourists to provide a much needed motivation. Jogging in isolation is quite boring. That's an absorbency I don't have.

I have the absorbency for QQ

--as I told boy...
when i face a wrong-* temptation outside home, I only need to say NO once. There's no wrong-qty temptation. The high price tag is a natural defense on my side.

when i face a wrong-* temptation at home, I need to say NO over and over. There's less wrong-food temptation. The 'soon-to-be-discarded' reminder is an enemy.

Many popular diets ignore the fact that per 100 gram, fat has more than twice the number of calories as carb or protein.

Therefore, I always insist on limiting fat intake.

I should try this more. 
Without rice, I felt less guilty, more free

how would LKY or a rich guy deal with the temptations of home cooking?

What if money is not an issue? i would live away from family for several days when my diet gets out of control.

Q: Can protein powder replace a meal?
With plenty of ice (chia seed is secondary) it did fill my stomach AND provide energy. However, the wrong-time temptation is overpowering. 
I think key is starch. Protein powder has no starch. If I have not tasted starch for a while, then it's hard.

Q: how about red bean paste?
Let me say it again -- chia, ice, protein powder can provide a full meal, but if you have had no starch for a while, then the temptations simply wipe out everything and you can feel hungry (hedonic) again. This is the nature of our senses.
