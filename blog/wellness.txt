With dental hygiene, I rely on highly frequent dental scaling to compensate for flossing.

The t$cost@scaling is tolerable in SG but will someday become less available, and resemble the yoga situation.

The challenge is mostly in the mind.

I was able to climb at least one flight of stairs every day when living in Blk 177 or #1173.

Daily stretch is supposed to be essential, but evidence is far from strong enough to change people's behavior. 
I wonder what strong evidence would provide sufficient absorbency for daily 1m practice.
I wonder what strong evidence would provide sufficient absorbency for daily 30m practice.

workout 5 days a week is the recommendation, but 90% of adults can't find the absorbency/time.

Frequent refresh is important to my son's academic studies, but he doesn't recognize it.

Daily flossing is recommended but I won't do it until my teeth give me big big problems.

-- reflections on the kidney health brochure
no [:=zero or very low] pleasure in alcohol, salt, or gaming ... is loss of enjoyment but I wish to have this more boring life .. more blessing than a curse

Angelina Jolie chose to have her breasts removed.. loss of joy and pleasure, but compare that loss to the pain of kidney failure or long-term cancer care.

Mass media (beyond advertisement) portray pleasures in food, alcohol, tobacco, sex, extreme sports ... In contrast, my chosen lifestyle is boring. 
Boring lifestyle is correlated with less pain, less bodily harm [incl. illnesses]

More than 50% of the people secretely with that the consequence of those pleasures is a painless death at an earlier age than the boring life. Most of these individuals underestimate the length and severity of ill health during the twilight years.

Kidney patients have many diet restrictions. I guess some of them may consider the question "what would I tell my younger self?" I think some may face the stark choice between 2 lifestyles

* longevity as the priority. Restrict calories, sweet, alcoholic foods. Is such a life worth re-living? Perhaps this is a Buddhist perspective but I want to downplay the Buddist influence.
* pleasure as a basic priority, but plenty of sufferings down the road

Hit  by Expected enticing foods a few times a week as in Bayonne, I win 80% of the time. The other times I have controlled indulgence.

Hit by UnExpected enticing foods on a daily basis, I win 20% of the time. The number of lost battles is now 5x

My BMI improvement comes at a cost, but the cost should not exceed a limit. I told the MS colleague in the 750Seventh pantry "Not exactly self-discipline per se." He was surprised and puzzled.

With the 10x hazard rate, I can easily win only 20% of the battles (no precise criteria) and I may need to win 90% to hit my BMI target, but that may require undue deprivation[1], superhuman self-discipline, lots of raw celery ! 

If the effort is always a superhuman effort and requires that much sacrifice and willpower, then the effort is unsustainable, and not worth it.

eg: To be sustainable, yoga should be rewarding not a torture. My fwd bend in Sec 1 was a torture, unsustainable and unrewarding. Supuerhuman self-discipline is insufficient in the long run.

eg: "Skating practice should be enjoyable and rewarding, not dreadful."

-- [1] deprivation? Food should be a joy at least some of the times. 
eg: Availability of alcohol creates a struggle in the recovering alcoholic, possibly torture. However, ultimately, you could get over it and live with the availability, rather than get tortured by it year in year out.

why the yoga instructors give such tough instructions? Because some students can do it !

In contrast, cardio classes don't make me feel so bad because instructions are reasonable to me, but probably unreasonable to some.

It's tough to tell yourself "If I can't follow the instruction then I just take things easy." The whole point of coming to the class is the team environment.

-- new chin-up
retraining chin-up (and stretch) is dreadful but not push-up or cardio

My self-talk matters. My self-talk reflects my perception of reality. This perception affects my actions.

I guess my target for chin-up is too high. I typically aim at 10 chin-up or 40 push-up in a session. 

I think the start-up is harder for chin-up. 5 chin-up = 20 push-up.

-- update: modified form
modified form is required when most of the poses are unreachable. However, when I try my own modified forms, they criticize me.

-- update frq:
at twice a week, the total hours would be 3 to 5/wk, based on my Bayonne experience. This is much more than the hours I can allocate to all other workouts combined. Therefore, the tcost is unsustainable.

Reality is, yoga isn't life-saving like kidney dialysis that must be performed weekly. Most guys are unable to do 3 sessions/week and therefore 3 sessions/week is unrealistic for most people, just like 5 workouts/week.Â 

The sustainable tcost has to be based on self-practice.

-- new: OK to have a favorite workout@@ or update blogpost on workout priorities https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=10950&action=edit
.. the need to balance enjoyments with wellness priorities 
some people (mostly women) enjoy yoga and nothing else.
some people (mostly men) enjoy muscle training and nothing else .. I think many Americans do.
some people enjoy jogging among other cardios such as skip rope, and nothing else. I still find stadium more conducive than other jogging places.

I don't want to sound negative, alarming and detract from your enthusiasm for your favorite workout, but in each case there is a small risk of neglecting other exercises.

Too much muscle training can affect BMI and flexibility, two of the most important aspects of wellness. I am unlikely to become bulky, but flexibility is a traditionally neglected area.

Too much jogging can lead to loss of flexibility and muscle as we age.

Some women do mostly yoga including some limited strength training, so they lack CRE. Therefore, some combine yoga with cardio. 

Ideally, you would want to enjoy a range of workouts, but few individuals are so lucky. For every adult and child, consistent workout is repetitive and requires a lot of effort and absorbency. Team sports and golf are more fun but requires a lot of external help.

-- new: challenge of chin-up target
A realistic goal would be one a day, but such a goal doens't generate positive feedback. 

I remember my yoga goal was one minute a day. I managed to change my perception to feel good about it.

For chin-up, I need the same change of perception.

-- fuxi: compensation when coming home
when I come home from office, I look forward to (expectation of) a reward for the sacrifices, an unwinding of the strict control 
I feel I deserve some comfort food.

It feels too harsh to deny myself of the comfort foods.

Luckily I don't demand starch or fattty comfort foods. Fancy fruits are fine.

It is a sign of good appetite for relatively healthy foods. You don't want get rid of this appetite, do you? What you want to get rid of is the unexpected food
