--somehow, I feel icecream is lighter than the starchy foods in Singapore.

I think my feeling is contraciting published calorie density.

I think ice cream has lots of water. 
--new strategy against the starchy foods from grandma
eat lots of veg + fruits + milkshake

--new: 4 types of carbs
re the blogpost on resistant starch

I think the U.S. weight-loss industry targets all forms of carbs indiscriminately. Many commentators exclude fiber. Some exclude fruit sugar. My view is kinda mainstream in my focus on table sugar and starch

* table sugar and ... are widely critized and should be taken in moderation. Table sugar can affect heart and diabetes.
* fruit sugar -- is widely considered similar to table sugar but I doubt it completely. No evidence suggests fruit sugar cause weight gain.
* starch -- I find it quite fattening, but I believe the calorie density is below half of fat. Most people tend to eat many many grams of starch so it is probably responsible for weight
* dietary fiber -- there's plenty of research showing these carbs are not absorbed, but still most calorie numbers treat it same as table sugar

Around the time of SiemReap flight booking, I ate quite a lot of starchy foods grandma bought or cooked.

This is a classic case study.

One factor is stress. The flight booking was stressful.

One factor is wrong-* temptations. In this case, there was a bit of wrong-time temptation in the morning after the flight booking. I was not hungry, but I gave in to the temptation after the food was heated.

One factor is quality of nutrition. This starchy food is not as bad as creamy cakes or ice cream. I also ate carrot for balance.
 
One of the biggest factors in my mind was quantity of calories. I can only guesstimate that the quantity was huge.

This blogpost is about diet. Beyond diet, a major factor affecting my zsms is the burn/rot/roti on that day. I had a coding drill with Ashish, one of the toughest in 3 months. I then went back to office and did a bit of work. In office I had a stressful call with NCT. I also had a useful dabao coaching session on word problem, one of the most significant in a year. The cambodia trip legwork (visa, flight) was a major effort. I also had a few lotus sessions including in ofifce.. In hindsight, I dismissed/forgot these non-trivial achievements on that day and zoomed into the diet "loss of control".

--update blogpost on "best starch": grandma said some raw grains are more fibrous, but to me, all grans are starch
Starch means addictive, wrong-quantity temptation, and heavy impact on weight.

I still prefer green peas and beans for the lower starch density
