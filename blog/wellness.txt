--Saumik said twist and backbend would help straighten the spine and fix the scoliosis.
Without making effort, aging would worsen it.
x-ray could reveal it.

stretch should be enjoyable, not painful.
Postures are important but Modifications are often necessary.
I feel his modifications are not effective for me. 
I would go with my own modifications.

--new: cooked child veg dish that don't need any starch is good. 

no need to reheat

--Without maid, let's consider buying pre-washed leafy salad. More available in the U.S. 
In SG context... still Cheaper than maid and will boost my self-esteem.

ERE author said "The amount we spend reflects the extent of failure in our skills and imagination"

However, in wellness I beg to differ. I would take yoga classes and go for 3M dental cleaning because I know (and accept) my failure/limitation in terms of daily flossing. 

--Q: how did I become focused on such "alien" endeavors like yoga, raw veg, fasting, early sleep, protein powder, buying pre-washed salad, blood donation.

I said "focused" because with a steady focus I started trying and seeing improvements.

Most if not all of them were undreamed of for my entire life, and completely alien to the younger version of me.

Some of them I tried and failed repeated and gave up hope -- yoga, early sleep, 

Some of them were considered too expensive and not worthwhile -- pre-washed, protein, 


--fruit juice is more convenient than whole fruits but is inferior because
* many bad ingredients are hidden. 
* juice go bad as fast as half-eaten fruits
* less fiber, less filling
* many fruit flavored drinks are nothing but a regular sugary drink with a bit of fruit flavor additive. Nothing to do with juice at all.

--new: buying washed veg salad: spending habit change #watershed

The day before my 3k762 return flight, I bought a relatively expensive packaged salad for P109 as insurance. Bought without fear, regret, or oth

(I also bought raw onion but let's focus on the expensive packaged salad.)

benefit -- (limited) insurance against unhealthy group dining. (Limited like "daily cash" insurance) In that event, this insurance payout would buffer the impact, esp. in terms of guilt, self-contempt and self-hate.

benefit -- insurance against late night hunger on the final night.

Benefit -- insurance against in-flight hunger that I actually experienced. How effective is the insurance? Not perfect but it did help.

surprise benefit -- I was able to eat this raw leafy veg without meat, nuts, ice cream or starch .. a diet I never considered possible

Q: What if discarded? Should consider it as option premium.

--slowly get into the habit of eating/buying small packet of nuts

--many say health is #1 in their personal life, in their long view, but their personal actions don't reflect it

Am slowly pulling ahead of the pack, mostly in terms of diet, exercise, sleep etc. I notice my change when traveling with other people.

Perhaps more important than the (visible) habits (I don't like the word "lifestyle") is the perception (or wisdom).

I often say grandma tends to feel superior in her fitness. In personal wellness, perhaps some moderate level of superiority is a valuable part of self-respect, self-esteem and positive pride.

--sitting in Manila airport gate 9 waiting room, I slowly managed to achieve lotus pose that I never thought possible.

(similarly, the raw leafy salad I ate on 3k762 was something I never thought possible.)

Seat was not as deep as a regular sofa. 
Lotus is one of my weakest poses all my life.

I deserve a lot of credit. 

Hardly noticed but tough improvement
--turning point
At BGC yoga class with about 20 women, I am no longer the weakest student, with the poorest form.
Note The poses were not about hip opening, or splits, or back-bend. 
Nevertheless, none of the class is easy.

I think I was visibly weak only at TPY real yoga

In hind sight, viewed together with the VirginActive yoga instructor conversation (Jess?), This experience might be a turning point and game changer for me.

--diet loss@control due to self^them
when I lost control due to evn factors beyond my control, I tend to feel resentful and powerless. Family dinner and office free food are prime examples.

When I lose control due to personal conscious decision (including the decision to believe someone), I take responsibility. I have no one to blame. 
I tend to take action to correct it.
I know I could have better control next time.
====new: hard-driving^self-constraint
Both are considered self-control and self-discipline.

Among the thousands of people I consider comparable, My relative strength lies in self-constraint... 95 marks vs 93 marks in hard-driving.

-- Buddhism, wellness ... emphasize self-constraint 

eg: early rise. Many can't persuade themselves to sleep early
eg: slow jog of grandpa
eg: absorbency

-- achievement, competition, sports .. emphasize hard-driving. 

--combo of the two , or unclear
eg: refresh past learning

--new Q: 
why are yoga practitioners predominantly women?

The BGC yoga instructor observed
* men tend to see yoga as too slow.
* men tend to see flexibility as less important
* the muscular men tend to find yoga too hard. 

--Last BGC yoga trainer examined my neck and advised me
* daily head rotation to loosen the back-of-neck inflexibility
* I probably "incur" too much looking-upward as if sitting below the screen level

I think neck pain is very common among my peers.

--advice from two BGC yoga instructors on my lower-back fwd bend.
* D/dog should prioritize lower back rather than hamstring, and therefore favor knee-bend
* standard fwd-bend can also include knee-bend to provide better focus on lower-back.

Since tight hamstring often interfere with lower-back stretching, each time we need to prioritize between them. Lower back is clearly more important than hamstring.

--On the bgc trip, I decided and wrote down that "yoga is more important than remote work"
Yoga requires more absorbency than jogging, QQ, etc

--the only reason to prefer the yoga or driving here (over SG) is cost

--today at the 2 meals with the group, I practiced bao3shan1 tactics, effectively

The milkshake, though expensive, made me feel full, and in-control, self-respected (even superior)

--insight: 
In a slightly-low-cost location, I can allow myself to eat healthy-but-expensive, healthy-but-unappealing.

Q: what healthy food would I eat more often in SG?
A: pre-washed veg salad, packaged cut fruits, protein smoothie

--3 regrets@3company meals
* regret: dessert at Mexican. I said no but then no one else took the food. I hate to see waste of fine food. A doctor once wrote "still wasted if you throw the food into your stomach". Well, I feel unsure this time as it does satisfy a craving for the triple threat.
* wise: I added chia seeds to the Mexican dessert
* wise: didn't order any drink... expensive, no health benefit no satisfaction.
* wise: had lots of raw veg before these feasts
* wise: didn't eat the fried fish or army stew .. no satisfaction
* wise: very low amount of Korean fried rice. Mostly to help me digest the fried chicken
* regret? Korean fried chicken as it is hard to remove the fatty parts.

--
Myth: fruit sugar is as bad as table sugar. Well, there are lots of fiber and water content. Also minerals. 

Myth? Raisin is no different from sugar

Myth? egg yolk is as bad as other animal fat

Myth: peanuts, almonds .. are no different from cooking oil. Well, there's lots of fiber. Also, Animal fats are fundamentally different. Some minute amount of special something could make a difference .. making nuts heart-healthy.  

--fuxi: once my stomach is stretched due to a few big meals, it tends to send stronger hunger signal earlier than before.
My mom said this many years ago.

--why weekly yoga is harder than diet, jogging, codingDrill..
yoga, diet daily battle, coding drill .. all feel like Promethean struggles.
But Why was yoga so utterly hopeless compared to the others? 
* key reason -- whatever my effort, I remain clearly way below average among the "peers" though in reality those "peers" are mostly women and yoga instructors

* key reason -- yoga is too hard to hold and require too much willpower. Jogging and coding drill are better. The yoga poses I pick are way too painful. I can barely hold for 5 seconds but I force myself to hold many times longer. I set an unrealistic target and set myself up for failure

* reason (?) -- i don't see any progress. This is actually a common "phenomenon" in diet, coding drill, jogging etc. Somehow I used this argument for decades to dismiss the idea of daily stretch.

--new: yoga4life: regular practice

daily practice is not easy at all. Let's be realistic.

.. frq and duration
Aim at 1 min/session, 5 sessions a week, for 2 months.
Longer sessions? not practical due to my current mental block
short sessions have the "anywhere" advantage
less frq? not so effective. 

.. modest vs tough poses
In Macq corridor, I focused on only the hard poses and gave up within weeks. Now I want to use modest ones.

Jess Lin said even the easy poses can be helpful. 

Jess said many easy poses can become harder when you focus on your form.
Downward dog is good case in point.

I would use mostly modest poses, and try hard ones only when in the mood.

When you stop breathing (perhaps in the tough zone), your focus is off and you are no longer doing yoga.

.. how many poses?
Pick from a modest pool of 20 poses. There are hundreds of poses but I can ignore them for my life and still have a rewarding yoga habit.

.. yoga self^group practice
For lifelong practice, foundation has to be self practice. I don't want to rely solely on the fancy facilities.. unsustainable.

Classes can get me into the tougher zone and longer session. Classes can also reboot a declining routine.


--yoga: i tend to compare with ..
1. I tend to compare with long-time practitioners. Note most long-time practitioners are pretty good at yoga. I'm a real hero because I am a long-time practitioner even though I'm not good at it.

2. Most of the experienced practitioners are women. I end up treating them as my peers.

3. for guys, I mostly look at yoga instructors.

4. for the regular guys, I mostly look at the poses they are good at and basically ignore the many more poses that I'm good at.

--xp
eating lots of fruits + veg even when not hungry didn't add to my weight.

I feel starch, fat and perhaps protein add to my weight.

Fish? Not sure

milk? not sure

--new: ## easy stretches I can do any time, even at home
* lotus on sofa
* downward dog
* back/side bend, twist

--Q: why buy mixed veg rice when I have free home cooking?
A: there are many veg (+meat) missing in my home cooking
A: qty-tempation in home cooking. Outside food is rationed
When I reach home late and the leftover is boxed up, I feel no obligation to "finish that tiny amount". 

--fuxi: 
sugar + fat + salt is the common description of modern processed food.

For me the killer combo is starch + fat + sugar, in that order.

--fuxi: the pizzahut experience

I couldn't stick to my rule "no food if not hungry". I decided to break my rule but I fought a Baoshan war :

* chia seeds ... added to mushroom soup 
* cabbage + onion ... added to pizza
* I ordered the veg soup instead of mushroom soup

Every small decision counts. I feel proud of myself.

--fuxi: for stable cholesterol level, one test per year is good enough. 
Remember to include full blood count

--fuxi: nutrient timing is invented for ultra-endurance athletes. The reserach findings are not directly applicable to the ordinary people.
--fuxi when it comes to calorie counting, One of the least noticed math features is
various degrees of "bad" when we decide to loosen up and eat bad food
I feel creamy cakes are among the worst, but for most people, it is probably impractical to completely avoid creamy foods as if they were opium. Various degree of bad -- fried peanut and alcohol are both worse than creamy.. tobacco is worst than alcohol and drugs are worse than tobacco. 

In the mass media, we can see the different attitudes towards different categories of "bad" foods

More stupid are the calorie-dense foods that aren't satisfying -- fried peanuts; alcohol; mint ice-cream; cheese chunks; 

--fuxi: yoga or jogging [1] can interfere with my xx/codingDrill, boy's math, work laser ...

[1] swimming is more time consuming.

mini-exercise is less interference

--fuxi: wellness review on bizclass flight
* salad very healthy, without dressing. I at the more salad today than any day over last 6M
* three servings of fruits
* rice I didn't eat up, better than before
* some stretching
* plenty of water
* moderate red wine for heart health
* restraint on cakes, chocolate, ice cream etc, not as unconstrained as before 
* before the flight, I did eat lots of fruits + radish

--fuxi: luxury, medically unnecessary -- these commercial offerings are effective for some athletes or patients, but not clinically proven to be nearly as effective as medicines
* skincare products
* hair treatments
* most MLM supplements
* meal timing
