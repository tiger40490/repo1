Many popular diets ignore the fact that per 100 gram, fat has more than twice the number of calories as carb or protein.

Therefore, I always insist on limiting fat intake.

Q: Can protein powder replace a meal?
With plenty of ice (chia seed is secondary) it did fill my stomach AND provide energy. However, the wrong-time temptation is overpowering. 
I think key is starch. Protein powder has no starch. If I have not tasted starch for a while, then it's hard.

Q: how about red bean paste?
Let me say it again -- chia, ice, protein powder can provide a full meal, but if you have had no starch for a while, then the temptations simply wipe out everything and you can feel hungry (hedonic) again. This is the nature of our senses.
