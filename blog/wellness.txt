for the 2nd time I bought the $7.50 Novena salad
I would say the home cooking $cost of an equivalent meal is $2-5 but some of the ingredients are unavilable at home.

--new: oil-free grilling, steaming, boiling, microwaving=healthiest cooking methods
Most cooks including my family would use "a few drops" of oil to enhance taste, but it is a slippery slope.

For my longetivity, I want to develop my appetite and taste for
* oil-free "light" cooking
* raw food

Started in 2018, these changes sound impermanent, meerly fashionable, whimsical, and undefensible in the face of real-world challenges, but I think these small lifestyle changes go a long way towards wellness including immunity and longetivity.

--step back. Recognize that I don't really have a power surge for jogging 3 times in a row

i feel guilty for not going there but going has a tcost and an opportunity cost. Am not as efficient as I claim to be when scolding my son.

If I have the power surge I could simply work out in office or at home! 
Limiting factor is not time but absorbency

I feel SG is one of the better places to get treatment

--new or update blogpost on stamina/strength
freedom from ill health > healthy longevity > stamina > strong > flexible

"Freedom" includes things like immunity, recovery, and karma. It is slightly more achievable and predictable than longevity.

Note longevity-in-poor-health is not really my goal.

Strength is slightly more than muscles strength. Muscle mass is a low priority to me. Those (sportspeple) who gain muscle mass often have a hard time maintaining BMI in old age.

For bone health and some other elements of health, adequate muscle strength is crucial.

Fitness means slightly more than stamina. Stamina means cardio-respiratory endurance (CRE) to me. For me, fitness (and also most strengths) is measured against body weight.
