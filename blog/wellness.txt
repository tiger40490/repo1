-- update 5/wk post:
For squat and stairs, we can incrementally build up a session.
squat: [200<-500]

with squat, stairs, chin-up etc (mostly against body weight), even the slowest workout has a real intensity.

With boxing and jogging, slow means low intensity. Speed would easily tripple the intensity.

-- new: challenge of chin-up target
A realistic goal would be one a day, but such a goal doens't generate positive feedback. 

I remember my yoga goal was one minute a day. I managed to change my perception to feel good about it.

For chin-up, I need the same change of perception.

-- fuxi: compensation when coming home
when I come home, I look forward to (expectation of) a reward for the sacrifices, an unwinding of the strict control 
I feel I deserve some comfort food.

It feels too harsh to deny myself of the comfort foods.

Luckily I don't demand starch or fattty comfort foods. Fancy fruits are fine.

It is a sign of good appetite for relatively healthy foods. You don't want get rid of this appetite, do you? What you want to get rid of is the unexpected food
