-- ice cream vs fancy bread
In terms of BMI impact, I feel ice cream has 2 advantages
* lot of ice/water... filling
* portion control -- for a few years, each time the amount I take is usually beslow 1.5 cones. In contrast, fancy breads (breadtalk++) tend to get eaten in bigger portions.

cakes Bread has an advantage 
* raw veg -- ice cream can help me eat some raw veg but somewhat less than cakes/breads

--new: mini ice cream
Each mini cone is 28 ml. My favorite iberri cone is 110 ml, 3.93 times the size.

I don't know why, but in reality, my kids and I tend to eat 1 cone, at most 2, never four, so this is extremely effective portion control.

I guess my kids enjoy the fun of unwrapping. 

--new: mix veg rice without rice
I should try this more. 
Without rice, I felt less guilty, more free

--new:
how would LKY or a rich guy deal with the temptations of home cooking?

What if money is not an issue? i would live away from family for several days when my diet gets out of control.

--new: same tempting food always easier to manage if outside
That's why I always bring the most tempting food to office.

--update or fuxi
Can protein powder replace a meal?

With plenty of ice (chia seed is secondary) it did fill my stomach AND provide energy. However, the wrong-time temptation is overpowering. 

Let me say it again -- chia, ice, protein powder can provide a full meal, but if you have had no starch no fat for a while, then the temptations simply wipe out everything and you can feel hungry (hedonic) again. This is the nature of our senses.
