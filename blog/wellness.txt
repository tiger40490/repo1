--new jolt: home food is better quality but..
many friends warn me that home cooking use far "healthier" food than commercial cooking.

raw food is safest!

For me, biggest problem is wrong time and wrong quantity, not wrong nutrition

--update blogpost on wrong-time temptation
"wrong time" is a problem even at food court, but the $cost requires me to choose only one meal. The cost makes me slow down and think.

With home meal there's no speed bump! So we have to exercise self-constraint which is tough for most of us.

--fuxi: since boy lacks self-control, i can  bring his bad food to office and giving away

What he enjoys most is the buying not the eating !

Boy should pay for it.

--most foods pictured in commercials are calorie-dense

People get used to calorie-dense foods and crave for more.

CNY eve steamboat in hindsight
:) very very low starch and fried food, against temptation of wrong-food
:) removed all visible fat
:) no drinks
:) lots of veg + tofu for fill-up. Even more fruits
:) threw away jelly leftover by boy

lots of beef, pork and fish. In hindsight, slightly too much beef. Luckily grandma stopped me.

--fuxi: With an upcoming scheduled feast in mind, fasting becomes more manageable.

Without the feast, fasting feels self-deprivation.

--new strategy against the starchy foods from grandma
eat lots of veg + fruits + milkshake

--fuxi: 
Around the time of SiemReap flight booking, I ate quite a lot of starchy foods grandma bought or cooked.

This is a classic case study.

One factor is stress. The flight booking was stressful.

One factor is wrong-* temptations. In this case, there was a bit of wrong-time temptation in the morning after the flight booking. I was not hungry, but I gave in to the temptation after the food was heated.

One factor is quality of nutrition. This starchy food is not as bad as creamy cakes or ice cream. I also ate carrot for balance.
 
One of the biggest factors in my mind was quantity of calories. I can only guesstimate that the quantity was huge.

This blogpost is about diet. Beyond diet, a major factor affecting my zsms is the burn/rot/roti on that day. I had a coding drill with Ashish, one of the toughest in 3 months. I then went back to office and did a bit of work. In office I had a stressful call with NCT. I also had a useful dabao coaching session on word problem, one of the most significant in a year. The cambodia trip legwork (visa, flight) was a major effort. I also had a few lotus sessions including in ofifce.. In hindsight, I dismissed/forgot these non-trivial achievements on that day and zoomed into the diet "loss of control".
