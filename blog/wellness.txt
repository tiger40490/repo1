-- fuxi: why no toothache in the last 10-20Y, basically not in SG /whereas/(not "while") I had them in China? 
No age pattern among the population.
So I guess I'm just lucky.

My dental care is one contributing factor including brushing and frequent checks.
--fuxi or new: bigger risk: too(much^little)nice food@home
I feel 80% of the risk is the too-much risk

In the too-little scenario (too little healthy comfort food at home), I could end up eating ice cream, or toast+peanut butter, or quick noodles, or peanuts

--as I told boy...
when i face a wrong-* temptation outside home, I only need to say NO once. There's no wrong-qty temptation. The high price tag is a natural defense on my side.

when i face a wrong-* temptation at home, I need to say NO over and over. There's less wrong-food temptation. The 'soon-to-be-discarded' SMS is an enemy.

--fuxi: mix veg rice without rice
I could try this more. 
Without rice, I felt less guilty, more free

--fuxi:
how would LKY or a rich guy deal with the temptations of home cooking?

What if money is not an issue? i would live away from family for several days when my diet gets out of control.

Q: Can protein powder replace a meal?
With plenty of ice (chia seed is secondary) it did fill my stomach AND provide energy. However, the wrong-time temptation is overpowering. 
I think key is starch. Protein powder has no starch. If I have not tasted starch for a while, then it's hard. Try adding some cooked green beans, corn or rice

Q: how about red bean paste?
Let me say it again -- chia, ice, protein powder can provide a full meal, but if you have had no starch for a while, then the temptations simply wipe out everything and you can feel hungry (hedonic) again. This is the nature of our senses.
