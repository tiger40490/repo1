--new: wellness can be overrated
I and my friends often say net worth is overrated and wellness is undervalued.

Look at fitness instructors and discharged soldiers. Also some of the professional athletes. They are often very fit. Some (not all) of them are more healthy than the general population.

However, many of them struggle to make a living. A minority of them become successful businesspeople. The rest and the majority of them are ordinary in terms of income and life chances.

In my rather biased view, the most common "problem" with these physically fit people is brbr anad cash flow low ground. 

* if Bob among them is able to make a good living, then his fitness is a great asset in his life.
* if Alice among them is able to keep her burn rate very low, and hit brbr below 2, then her fitness is a great asset.

Now, most of my friends are not from that background. Our income is a few times above average. Some of us are still trapped on cashflow low ground, perhaps due to brbr, high leverage. Personal wellness is now a huge differentiator.

The relative importance of wellness is best seen in this context.

For decades, i seldom felt hungry in the morning.

Some told me to try and feel the hunger, create the appetite

Some said breakfast would delay the hunger for lunch. Completely wrong prediction in my case. Breakfast always intensifies, not decreases appetite at lunch time.

Some said a decent lunch would suppress hunger in the afternoon. Completely wrong in my case. The obvious fact in my case is, even if eat a resonable lunch at 2pm, by 5 i would experience real urge to eat

One of the least mentioned but most valuable resources I can give my kids is my live presence due to my healthy longevity.

Even at age 80 I can be a role model for them,  sharing my wisdom, otherwise my lessons learnt.

Look at grandpa or grandma. Their presence has a net-positive effect, because they are not yet dependent and burdensome.

now vs 2019, my bmi is worse due to 4kg, even though
* i have maintained my starch abstinence and veg/fruit + milkshake
* I have maintained my meal delay
* I have maintained to some extent intermittent fasting. I believe (without enough evidence) that iFF I cut the late night meal then BMI would improve

I may have to accept status quo for now and keep working on BMI
