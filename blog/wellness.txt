--new: Every now and then, I feel resentful for my wife's (and to a lesser extent my mother's) remarks that she thinks I look unhealthy.

I work very hard to reduce my calorie intake but her words  weaken the precious resolve I have built for my diet. Her words have the potential to derail my entire effort.

I feel scared -- Once I lose this precious resolve, I would put on, say, 3kg and hate myself (and her). What scares me most is my hatred. 

The frustration doesn't help my effort, but is there a way to turn her words into a positive force? Sometimes I want to demonstrate to my wife that I'm better than those individuals she considers healthier, but I am afraid of setting myself a target that creates more self-hate.

The control and responsibility belongs to me. I take full ownership. However, I feel vulnerable, weak and unstable, so much so that I notice a tendency to blame the environment and other people.

I wish I was stronger, able to withstand the adversities hitting me every now and then.

..reflection after the chat with Bindi
trust that you have the resolve and the strength to restore your current weight after a 5kg "disaster". I have the image of the aging Batman.

I tend to feel the current excellent BMI level is by luck, not effort. In the cool light of day, I see it's at least 70% by my effort.

Q: what if my wife says that again? Am scared.
A: try to stay calm and tell her that her words aren't helping. Then swiftly disengage. Ideally walk out.

Without the feast, fasting feels self-deprivation.

--new strategy against the starchy foods from grandma
eat lots of veg + fruits + milkshake

--update blogpost on best starch
grandma said some raw grains are more fibrous, but to me, all grains are starchy

Starch means addictive, wrong-quantity temptation, and heavy impact on weight.

I still prefer green peas and beans for the lower starch density

Around the time of SiemReap flight booking, I ate quite a lot of starchy foods grandma bought or cooked.

This is a classic case study.

One factor is stress. The flight booking was stressful.

One factor is wrong-* temptations. In this case, there was a bit of wrong-time temptation in the morning after the flight booking. I was not hungry, but I gave in to the temptation after the food was heated.

One factor is quality of nutrition. This starchy food is not as bad as creamy cakes or ice cream. I also ate carrot for balance.
 
One of the biggest factors in my mind was quantity of calories. I can only guesstimate that the quantity was huge.

This blogpost is about diet. Beyond diet, a major factor affecting my zsms is the burn/rot/roti on that day. I had a coding drill with Ashish, one of the toughest in 3 months. I then went back to office and did a bit of work. In office I had a stressful call with NCT. I also had a useful dabao coaching session on word problem, one of the most significant in a year. The cambodia trip legwork (visa, flight) was a major effort. I also had a few lotus sessions including in ofifce.. In hindsight, I dismissed/forgot these non-trivial achievements on that day and zoomed into the diet "loss of control".
