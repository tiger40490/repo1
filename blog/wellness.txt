--major lifestyle improvements in Sep 2019
* starch reduction
* 11pm craving effectively managed
* vegie salad
* early sleep
* elimination of starch and fat in office. I used to eat many snacks of biscuits, nuts, ..

Even if these improvements don't last, they are still worthwhile achievements to celebrate. They are very, very hard to achieve even if temporary

--luxury, medically unnecessary -- these commercial offerings are effective for some atheletes or patients, but not clinically proven to be effective as medicine
* skincare products
* hair products
* most supplements
* most MLM health supplements
* meal timing

--new: body-fat percentage
Many people believe that body-fat perentage is more improtant than weight. "If most of my weight is muscle and bones, then overweight is fine, like body builders; If some healthy-weight person is full of fat, that is real health issue."

I agree that BFP is more important than weight if measurable.

The problem is -- the measurement is extremely inaccurate. It's very hard to estimate the overall percentage of fat in our body. In particular, fat mass in our organs are impossible to measure. Any theory based on an unmeasurable quantity can't be a useful theory.

--update blogpost: even inconsistent meal skipping can be benefial to some people
Some parents believe delaying a meal by 30 minutes can harm their child. It's similar to the fear that a minute of sun radiation or 2nd-hand smoke can harm your health.

My Egyption roommrate at Bayonne believed the smell of any laundry that's not 100% dried could harm his health.

Q: without medication, Can my extreme diet alone keep LDL under control?
A: yes iFF lean enough. 

To be effective, I can cut further on ice cream, nuts, fried food, starch ..

--fuxi blog: 
most tempting bad foods for me -- 1) fat 2) starch 3) sugar(T) and combinations of them

--fuxi: nutrient timing is invented for ultra-endurance athletes. The reserach findings are not directly applicable to the ordinary people.

--new: fish cake
200 cal/100g, compared to 110 cal/100g of drained tuna. Should not overeat

I assume this is relatively high-quality protein.

:) Not addictive as port or chicken :)

--calorie is not everything for my son, but is the most important factor
For a weight watcher, It's already very hard if you focus on calorie restriction. Now if you get distracted by other things like "good fat", it will be even harder.

--Raffles screening
A man's health is not based on his "look". Chinese culture tends to associate plumpness with health.

consider knee support while jogging.

if cycling is too light for you, consider spin class.

--my stool nowadays are healthier .. less watery
When they were watery I was (more than slightly) worried, so now is time to feel good

--new: yoga Can (not could, not merely in-theory) have a slow, long-term effect on my mental + physical health
Yoga is not strategic to my current lifestyle. In contrast, BMI, endurance are more strategic as I could feel the physical "decline" more often

However, yoga Can (not could, not merely in-theory) have a slow, long-term effect on my mental + physical health
it can help me learn to relax
it helps me open myself to a proven method of relaxation
It can slowly build my self-confidence that I could overcome something really hard
It can slowly build my self-esteem that I could keep working on a really serious weakness (almost like a handicap)

Similarly, starch reduction has a similar effect on my self-confidence and long-term lifestyle benefit

--new: motivation4yoga was higher]Bayonne
due to my capabilities relative to classmates and instructor's expectation

SG yoga instructors had no encouraging words for a weak student like me.

! How does my son feel about my words on his math?

--my "extreme" diet is a keystone of minimalist lifestyle
starch reduction
calorie restriction
fiber intake
raw food

--fuxi when it comes to calorie counting, One of the least noticed math features is
various degrees of "bad" when we decide to loosen up and eat bad food
I feel creamy cakes are among the worst, but for most people, it is probably impractical to completely avoid creamy foods as they were opium. Various degree of bad -- alcohol is worse than creamy.. tobacco is worst than alcohol and drugs are worse than tobacco. 

In the mass media, we can see the different attitudes towards these "bad" foods

More stupid are the calorie-dense foods that aren't satisfying -- fried peanuts; alcohol; mint ice-cream; cheese chunks; 

--chia seeds fiber
Is the fiber contributing to calorie intake? I feel answer is no but research needed

Research show a non-trivial amount of fat content, but I don't feel any fat in its texture. Also, I would never eat more than 3 spoonful of chiat seeds a day.

I feel chia seed is very filling yet tastes very different from any of the fatty or starchy foods in my life. This is the main reason for my belief in its slimming benefit.

--new: the girl with A-grade flexibility (my grade? ...) 
may not be able to make a living as a yoga instructor, as Ankur could 
may not derive satisfaction and self-esteem from her superior flexibility
may be poor in balancing, strength and endurance (consider endurance sports)
is probably not going to win in any yoga competition, but why bother with competition? So why feel inferior to them?

--real cost of a yoga session
(great eg of git blogging beating web blogging!) 
$cost is trivial cf the other costs

By far the biggest cost is mental energy. I need to really persuade myself.

Another big cost is tcost. Commute, ..

Therefore, I would not worry about going in 5 min late.

--Make appt with Dr Colin Ong during lunch time?
I should this month, but no hurry

--update blogpost: nut oil is very different from animal fats

--fuxi: wellness review on bizclass flight

* three servings of fruits
* rice I didn't eat up, better than before
* some stretching
* plenty of water
* moderate red wine for heart health

* before the flight, I did eat lots of fruits + radish

--fuxi: protein smoothie
Most of the "marketing" and taste-enhancers are sugary, as majority of these consumers react to sugar.
Many sugary ingredients contain preservatives.
