--new: replace whole milk with lite icecream
Is icecream fattening. It feels like whole milk.

Perhaps I should replace a litter of whole milk with a cup of icecream?

--new: cake better buy small slice
big ice-cream/cake is cheaper but more damaging than small slices.

Small slice is expensive but relieves me of the struggle, pain and guilt of overeating.

My last experience – big slice of choco cake from CakeHistory … unable to leave half to next day

--new blogpost: nuts
Very few people point out the high fat + high calorie content of just a few nuts. See the picture  of 100g of nuts in ….

Other website highlight that nut fat is heart-healthy.

I like the Raffles magazine summary – need portion control to tiny amount of nuts…. so tiny that I would rather eat a big serving once a few months.

I think tiny amount of nuts are good for salad.

My son doesn’t need so much heart-healthy fat. He can enjoy nuts but in very small quantity

--loss ratio
mini-exercise has low overhead .. low loss
group class and jogging ... continuous
swimming has the poorest ratio
cycling is too light.. poor ratio

--yoga or jogging [1] can interfere with my xx/codingDrill, boy's math, work laser ...

[1] swimming is more time consuming.

mini-exercise is less interference

9 stubborn diet HABITS ranked in terms of impact on my long-term health

:) don't eat if not hungry, even when everyone is eating. My parents and in-laws believed we should all eat at the same time. Some people eat dinner early and don't feel hungry at night, but my body is different
:( heavy supper
:) self-restraint on oily, fried food , despite my nature
:) skip breakfast + lunch
:) delayed dinner
:) raw veg salad to break starch dependency
:( heavy afternoon snacks of nuts, starch ..
:) spot the visible fat. I believe every tidbit counts. I hate paying such high calorie "price" to gain basically nothing.
:) no coffee or sugary drink habit, despite peer influence 
:( cake-history buns once a day -- once formed, this habit was hard to break

--avoid ham showing sesame-sized visible fat. As stupid as fried peanuts, friend finger foods, alcohol. High calorie density but no pleasure whatsoever. 

--how I developed the late night supper habit
In my late teens or early 20's, I discovered that my mental sharpness, productivity peak at night. I guess the mental energy need fuel at night

--fuxi: Just as QQ is a surprise cornerstone of my entire career, weight is the surprise corner stone of my wellness

--two stress eating contexts
in office
family dinner -- escape if possible; otherwise drink a chia-milkshake right before the dinner
It also helps if they don't leave any rice. Rice is more dangerous than noodles etc. Rice is central to the family dinner struggle

--new?
In order to lower blood cholesterol, egg yolk avoidance was completely unnecessary and ineffective. This was my first big lesson about limitations of health science. 

Similarly, many people (boy, Deepak CM..) find it very hard to lose weight even if they follow all the tips. I feel their calorie intake is still too high.

--need to remind family members about boy's weight
On one hand, we want to be optimistic about boy's weight
On the other hand, statistically, most overweight kids aren't successful in losing weight

I need to be the role model in his life just like grandpa was in my life.

dental: brushing for 10 min? Actually more than 3 minutes each time hits /diminishing returns/ compared to flossing

frq of brushing is more important as bad stuff builds up over a few hours. Sansan learned from a book to brush 3 times daily -- role model

Thanks to my saliva, I didn't brush daily but still had no dental problem. Going forward, I want to be more proactive.

--new: weight-loss: popular yet ineffective ideas. NOte life science is fundamentally different from physical science. Individual differences often surprise us.
* heavy breakfast, light dinner
* reduce snacking
* no big meal after dinner like 8pm
* consistent meal timing
* fewer meals

--snacking can be good or bad for you
Some individuals take frequent snacks and others never take snacks. Both types can be healthy or unhealthy. There's poor correlation between health and snacking habith. How about the correlation between health and zodiac?

What matters is probably 1) calorie 2) quality of nutrition. Healthy snack nutrition is good; unhealthy snack nutrition is bad.

Some snackers (me for decades) eat hundreds of calories each snack. After the snack, either we delay/skip meals or keep big meals. The total calorie intake is heavily dependent on the snack + other meals during the day.

Effect on Total calorie is probably psychological. Mostly psychological in my case. For decades, my brain was trained to crave for snacks in late afternoon and late night. After the afernoon snack, the home meal is a real battle I win or lose every day -- not hungry but tempted by the sight of food.

--update blogpost: even inconsistent meal skipping can be beneficial to some people
Some parents believe delaying a meal by 30 minutes can harm their child. It's similar to the fear that a minute of sun radiation or 2nd-hand smoke can harm your health.

My Egyptian roommate at Juliet St ( Bayonne ) believed the smell of any laundry that's not 100% dried could harm his health.

Q: without medication, Can my extreme diet alone keep LDL under control?
A: yes iFF lean enough. 

To be effective, I can cut further on ice cream, nuts, fried food, starch ..

--fuxi: nutrient timing is invented for ultra-endurance athletes. The reserach findings are not directly applicable to the ordinary people.

--calorie is not everything for my son, but is the most important factor
For a weight watcher, It's already very hard if you are able to focus on calorie restriction. Now if you get distracted by other confusing messages like "good fat", it will be even harder.

--Raffles screening
consider knee support while jogging.

if cycling is too light for you, consider spin class.

--new: yoga Can (not could, not merely in-theory) have a slow, long-term effect on my mental + physical health
Yoga is not strategic to my current lifestyle. In contrast, BMI, endurance are more strategic as I could feel the physical "decline" more often

However, yoga Can (not could, not merely in-theory) have a slow, long-term effect on my mental + physical health
it can help me learn to relax
it helps me open myself to a proven method of relaxation
It can slowly build my self-confidence that I could overcome something really hard
It can slowly build my self-esteem that I could keep working on a really serious weakness (almost like a handicap)

Similarly, starch reduction has a similar effect on my self-confidence and long-term lifestyle benefit

--new: motivation4yoga was higher]Bayonne
due to my capabilities relative to classmates and instructor's expectation

SG yoga instructors had no encouraging words for a weak student like me.

! How does my son feel about my words on his math?

--fuxi when it comes to calorie counting, One of the least noticed math features is
various degrees of "bad" when we decide to loosen up and eat bad food
I feel creamy cakes are among the worst, but for most people, it is probably impractical to completely avoid creamy foods as if they were opium. Various degree of bad -- fried peanut and alcohol are both worse than creamy.. tobacco is worst than alcohol and drugs are worse than tobacco. 

In the mass media, we can see the different attitudes towards different categories of "bad" foods

More stupid are the calorie-dense foods that aren't satisfying -- fried peanuts; alcohol; mint ice-cream; cheese chunks; 

--new: the girl with A-grade flexibility (my grade? ...) 
may not be able to make a living as a yoga instructor, as Ankur could 
may not derive satisfaction and self-esteem from her superior flexibility
may be poor in balancing, strength and endurance (consider endurance sports)
is probably not going to win in any yoga competition, but why bother with competition? So why feel inferior to them?

--fuxi: wellness review on bizclass flight
* salad very healthy, without dressing. I at the more salad today than any day over last 6M
* three servings of fruits
* rice I didn't eat up, better than before
* some stretching
* plenty of water
* moderate red wine for heart health
* restraint on cakes, chocolate, ice cream etc, not as unconstrained as before 
* before the flight, I did eat lots of fruits + radish

--fuxi: luxury, medically unnecessary -- these commercial offerings are effective for some athletes or patients, but not clinically proven to be nearly as effective as medicines
* skincare products
* hair treatments
* most MLM supplements
* meal timing
