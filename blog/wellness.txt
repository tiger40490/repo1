Most elderly folks tend to become overweight, but some become underweight.

More prevalent than those two trends is loss of muscle mass.

I have hypolordosis (reduced lumbar lordosis). I sometimes imagine that if I could surgically sever some connective tissue in my lower back, then I would be able to bend forward "like them".

However, whatever is too short in my lowerback is still vital for my body. I am grateful to that piece, when I can swim, cycle, climb stairs, jog, squat, twist, side-bend, sit-up...

sweet potato .. I think sweet potato is starchy therefore less suitable for BMI
.. high insoluble fiber, better than white rice

I love sweet taste in my congee. Is honey and date better than sugar?
.. yes they are better than white sugar
.. monk fruit and stevia are real sugar substitute. No known risk

honey .. not real sugar substitute. Not really healthier than white sugar. Commercial RnD?

I have a habit of adding raw veg to an otherwise unhealthy snack. In hindsight, am not sure if the veg neutralized the unhealthy elements
.. not neutralized

dinner timing. If I try to accomodate meimei's timing for math, then I may need to delay my dinner by 30-60 minutes. Worthwhile?
.. 10pm start OK if you can avoid 2h dinner

date+walnet snack .. not too bad

holiday feast .. warm soup first;  minimize starch; limit cakes to 6 pieces/meal (assuming regular size).
I was reluctant to set target, but now I can accept the idea.

After age 60, can aim for BMI=25, and maintain muscle mass.
BMI 21.x is very good for my age.
Going back to 63 kg .. probably not something to aim at.

T2dm is not reversible but can be controlled. Prediabetes is reversible.

Sep 2024 sugg: slightly more protein, for my resistance training, including toufu, milk,,, Good idea for lunch or dinner. More beneficial than adding starch

exercise around times when you know hunger tends to strike .. may help some individuals deal with hedonic hunger. 

Some types of exercise such as short intensse workout may suppress levels of hormones known to drive appetite.

-- fuxi: Henry Lew suggestions:
Sugg 1: After seeing the home-cooked dinner, allocate a fixed portion for the night. Do not keep eating beyond that. 

Sugg 1b: Reduce allocation by 20%. The body and mind may not notice it.

Sugg 2: pre-emptive compensation .. Predict "night time compensation". If positive, then eat some starch (or whatever enticing food) before going home.
Then at home reduce the "allocation" by the pre-comp amount.

Sugg 3: when the craving starts, locate the part of the body. Then locate another part of the body that's comfortable. That makes a pair. Breathe in to the craving part, and breathe out to the comfort part.

Q: since what age did you start to notice appetite out of control
%%A: definitely before 30. Whenever I try to control my appetite, I would often find it hard to control.

Psychological inflexibility .. the behavior + the feeling follows one direction, but the control [self2 judge] is steering towards another direction. Conflict and loss of control. These negative consequences are not necessary. Controlled release/surrender can be beneficial.

enviable BMI can come at disproportionate cost
* Older adults often need to fight, on their back heels, an uphill battle to retain muscles. Losing muscle can reduce your BMI but it also affects your metabolism rate
* amputation can reduce your BMI, but do you want that?
