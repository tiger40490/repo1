-- new: OK to have a favorite workout@@ or update blogpost on workout priorities https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=10950&action=edit
.. the need to balance enjoyments with wellness priorities 
some people (mostly women) enjoy yoga and nothing else.
some people (mostly men) enjoy muscle training and nothing else .. I think many Americans do.
some people enjoy jogging among other cardios such as skip rope, and nothing else. I still find stadium more conducive than other jogging places.

I don't want to sound negative, alarming and detract from your enthusiasm for your favorite workout, but in each case there is a small risk of neglecting other exercises.

Too much muscle training can affect BMI and flexibility, two of the most important aspects of wellness. I am unlikely to become bulky, but flexibility is a traditionally neglected area.

Too much jogging can lead to loss of flexibility and muscle as we age.

Some women do mostly yoga including some limited strength training, so they lack CRE. Therefore, some combine yoga with cardio. 

Ideally, you would want to enjoy a range of workouts, but few individuals are so lucky. For every adult and child, consistent workout is repetitive and requires a lot of effort and absorbency. Team sports and golf are more fun but requires a lot of external help.
