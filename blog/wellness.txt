how would LKY or a rich guy deal with the temptations of home cooking?

What if money is not an issue? i would live away from family for several days when my diet gets out of control.

--new: same tempting food always easier to manage if outside
That's why I always bring the most tempting food to office.

Can protein powder replace a meal?

With plenty of ice (chia seed is secondary) it did fill my stomach AND provide energy. However, the wrong-time temptation is overpowering. 

Let me say it again -- chia, ice, protein powder can provide a full meal, but if you have had no starch no fat for a while, then the temptations simply wipe out everything and you can feel hungry (hedonic) again. This is the nature of our senses.
