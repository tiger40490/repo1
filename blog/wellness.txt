-- fuxi: wear tighter pants to company buffet. You won't regret.
-- fuxi: Whopper exprience @ TPY bus interchange
Price is much higher than the 山东大饼 or a hawker 杂菜饭. However, the dominant force needs to change from Price to nutrition. By customizing the cream level, whopper can be less oily than a lot of those foods.

Also, I have not tasted any beef burger for more than a year. Whopper is a premium version. The picture was enticing.
