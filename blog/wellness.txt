--new or update blogpost on stamina/strength
freedom from ill health > healthy longevity > stamina > strong > flexible

"Freedom" includes things like immunity, recovery, and karma. It is slightly more achievable and predictable than longevity.

Note longevity-in-poor-health is not really my goal.

Strength is slightly more than muscles strength. Muscle mass is a low priority to me. Those (sportspeple) who gain muscle mass often have a hard time maintaining BMI in old age.

For bone health and some other elements of health, adequate muscle strength is crucial.

Fitness means slightly more than stamina. Stamina means cardio-respiratory endurance (CRE) to me. For me, fitness (and also most strengths) is measured against body weight.
