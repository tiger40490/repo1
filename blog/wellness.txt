--Raffles screening
One's health is not based on the "look". Chinese culture tends to associate plumpness with health.

consider knee support while jogging.

if cycling is too light for you, consider spin class.

--my stool nowadays are healthier .. less watery
When they were watery I was (more than slightly) worried, so now is time to feel good

--new: motivation4yoga was higher]Bayonne
due to my capabilities relative to classmates and instructor's expectation

SG yoga instructors had no encouraging words for a weak student like me.

! How does my son feel about my words on his math?

--fuxi when it comes to calorie counting, One of the least noticed math features is
various degrees of "bad" when we decide to loosen up and eat bad food
I feel creamy cakes are among the worst, but for most people, it is probably impractical to completely avoid creamy foods as they were opium. Various degree of bad -- alcohol is worse than creamy.. tobacco is worst than alcohol and drugs are worse than tobacco. 

In the mass media, we can see that 

More stupid are the calorie-dense foods that aren't satisfying -- fried peanuts; alcohol; mint ice-cream; cheese chunks; 

--chia seeds fiber
Is the fiber contributing to calorie intake? I feel answer is no but research needed

Research show a non-trivial amount of fat content, but I don't feel any fat in its texture. Also, I would never eat more than 3 spoonful of chiat seeds a day.

I feel chia seed is very filling yet tastes very different from any of the fatty or starchy foods in my life. This is the main reason for my belief in its slimming benefit.

--new: the girl with A-grade flexibility (my grade? ...) 
may not be able to make a living as a yoga instructor, as Ankur could 
may not derive satisfaction and self-esteem from her superior flexibility
may be poor in balancing, strength and endurance (consider endurance sports)
is probably not going to win in any yoga competition, but why bother with competition? So why feel inferior to them?

--real cost of a yoga session
(great eg of git blogging beating web blogging!) 
$cost is trivial cf the other costs

By far the biggest cost is mental energy. I need to really persuade myself.

Another big cost is tcost. Commute, ..

Therefore, I would not worry about going in 5 min late.

Most of the "marketing" and taste-enhancers are sugary, as majority of these consumers react to sugar.
Many sugary ingredients contain preservatives.
