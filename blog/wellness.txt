#1 attractions of fish as compared to meat -- fat content

Intrinsic fat in fish is considered healthy. Intrinsic fat content is rather small even in fatty fish like salmon.

For red or white meat, the skin and other fats are heavy. Even for small bits of fat, I am pains-taking. Not needed with fish :)

eggs have the same advantage, but fish and egg white are the best animal proteins, even better than dairy.

if you are serious about visible fat, then avoid meat coated with flour. More than half the times I find skin or fat concealed by the coating.

--update blogpost on wrong-time temptation
"wrong time" is such a prevalent problem in SG (U.S. is costlier and less convenient). It is a problem even at food court, but the $$cost requires me to choose only one meal. The cost makes me slow down and think.

With home meal there's no speed bump! So we have to exercise self-constraint which is tough for most of us.
