--fuxi: mix veg rice without rice
I should try this more. 
Without rice, I felt less guilty, more free

--new jolt: Deepak on daily exercise
Deepak said compared to diet, exercise is relatively easy becasue he can do some exericse everyday. My perception of it affects my perception of my son. I tend to dismiss Deepak's claim on exercise. Perhaps he was doing relatively light exercise, perhaps for 30min+ each day for a few months. Reality is...
* Very few individuals (perhaps 1-3%) can achieve that.
* perhaps grandpa, with his strong self-mangement, could achieve something slightly higher at age 40. I'm not better than Deepak. I couldn't do 30min every day.
* even if his effort is not maintained for multiple years, there's a health benefit for the overweight individual, in terms of weight + various organs

--fuxi:
how would LKY or a rich guy deal with the temptations of home cooking?

What if money is not an issue? i would live away from family for several days when my diet gets out of control.

--new: same tempting food always easier to manage if outside home
That's why I always bring the most tempting food to office.

Can protein powder replace a meal?

With plenty of ice (chia seed is secondary) it did fill my stomach AND provide energy. However, the wrong-time temptation is overpowering. 

Let me say it again -- chia, ice, protein powder can provide a full meal, but if you have had no starch no fat for a while, then the temptations simply wipe out everything and you can feel hungry (hedonic) again. This is the nature of our senses.
