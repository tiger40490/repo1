if i eat a high-calorie, heavy dinner when not really hungry, I can still get really hungry the next morning.

This confirms my observation that calorie-induced ("genuine") hunger is largely driven by timing not .... The gap between the early dinner and the morning time is too long

--new jolt: icecream@eastCoast
Q: EastCoast family outing -- in what contexts would I "be there" with family at McDonald's without eating the wrong foods like ice cream?

It's revealing that if I don't go near McDonald's then I won't feel any appetite, but if I spend more than 3 minutes there with family, the (wrong time) temptation would feel irresistible.

A: if I'm more than 95% full then only I would feel no appetite for the ice cream. The level of physical fullness is a very poor predictor of appetite!
A: if I spend only half a minute at McDonald's, without prior planning.

Bao3shan1 -- eating one ice cream is not /destructive/ if I don't continue eating 5 more.

if you are serious about visible fat, then avoid meat coated with flour. More than half the times I find skin or fat concealed by the coating.

"wrong time" is such a prevalent problem in SG (U.S. is costlier and less convenient). It is a problem even at food court, but the $$cost requires me to choose only one meal. The cost makes me slow down and think.

With home meal there's no speed bump! So we have to exercise self-constraint which is tough for most of us.
