--update blogpost on home-food quality

buying icecream ^ home cooked meal

Ice cream cone is usually a conscious buy, less frequently wrong-time and rarely wrong qty.

home cooked food -- frequently wrong time and wrong qty.

The quality factor is smaller factor in the full picture.

In Bayonne I never had enticing home-cooked food waiting for me when I reach home.

In  SG, these foods are much more enticing than the restrictive foods I had in office !

Wrong time temptation? Partially, since I am not so hungry, but this is different from the typical case where I was not hungry at all.

wrong qty temptation? partially, since I tend to "finish off everything"

wrong food temptation? partially. These foods are not as light as the other foods

Sugg: use protein smoothie to combat the temptatioins?
Sugg: fancy fruits to combat the temptation
Sugg: eat something nice before coming home?

Due to family cooking (worse than the hawker foods), am fighting the daily battles more often, wrestling with the temptations more often. 

It's good to recognize the powerful environmental factors. Analog: trader blaming her predictive power and risk mgmt when the market is manipulated or influenced by a big player.

-- update blogpost on early rise
early rise is highly beneficial but can be overrated.
Need to document the costs!
* I could lose the late night momentum in coding drill, tech study, localSys etc
* camp-out is a proven big-gun  but contradicts early-rise

Similarly, regular workout has costs to be documented

--fuxi: dental care
i need more brushing, perhaps more frequent
I , meimei and boy need more frequent dental checks
meimei need to avoid sweet and also hard food

--fuxi: body scale
:) I nearly but didn't lose temper
:) no mean achievement to maintain below 64 kg for 5 months

--no blog: step back. Recognize that I don't really have a power surge for jogging 3 times in a row

i feel guilty for not going there but going has a tcost and an opportunity cost. Am not as efficient as I claim to be when scolding my son.

If I have the power surge I could simply work out in office or at home! 
Limiting factor is not time but absorbency

--fuxi: a covid19 infection in the family would disrrupt everything.
Be prepared psychologically.
I feel SG is one of the better places to get treatment
