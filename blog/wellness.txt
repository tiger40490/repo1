-- new: BMI: height measurement noise
Measurement noise (affects BMI) should NOT be 3cm. An Outram polyclinic doctor confirmed that my height was 176cm, so 1.73 or 1.74 would be a mismeasurement.

As we age, we will shrink, but until then, we should celebrate this "1 cm" and other small improvements.

Without tiptoeing, stand as straight as possible to maximize measurement. You can look up or down.

-- Henry Lew suggestions:
Sugg 1: After seeing the home-cooked dinner, allocate a fixed portion for the night. Do not keep eating beyond that. 

Sugg 1b: Reduce allocation by 20%. The body and mind may not notice it.

Sugg 2: pre-emptive compensation .. Predict "night time compensation". If positive, then eat some starch (or whatever enticing food) before going home .. pre-emptive compensation.
Then at home reduce the "allocation" by the pre-comp amount.

Sugg 3: when the craving starts, locate the part of the body. Then locate another part of the body that's comfortable. That makes a pair. Breathe in to the craving part, and breathe out to the comfort part.

Q: since what age did you start to notice appetite out of control
%%A: definitely before 30. Whenever I try to control my appetite, I would often find it hard to control.

Psychological inflexibility .. the behavior + the feeling follows one direction, but the control [self2 judge] is steering towards another direction. Conflict and loss of control. The neg consequences are not necessary. Controlled release/surrender can be beneficial.

I attended UrbanDen(beneath CIMB) yoga class with 20 other students, the first big yoga class in a year.
Some of the students near my mat were, like deja vu, so flexible as to put me to shame. 

.. Sinking feeling. 
If you have been working out on CRE, strength, etc but neglected flexibility, you are bound to hit a sinking feeling .. left behind.

Quality of life.

Suppose you go to a developing country where everyone you see is slim, mobile, able-bodied, and flexible, you may hit a sinking feeling like -- In the grand scheme of things, how valuable is your net worth?
Concrete example -- YY.Tao has an enviable net worth, but complained about his knee condition. As we age, such conditions are less likely to improve and recover.

If you never lose a battle, then you are not struggling enough and your goal is not challenging enough, or you are very harsh and depriving yourself completely.

BMI can come at disproportionate cost
* Older adults often need to fight, on their back heels, an uphill battle to keep muscle. Losing muscle can reduce your BMI but it also affects your metabolism rate
* amputation can reduce your BMI, but do you want that?
* Losing your healthy appetite, and becoming someone like grandpa in his late 80s, can reduce your BMI, but do you want that?
* During my covid infection, I lost appetite and BMI, but it is not worth it.

What's more important than BMI? See other bpost. freedom from ill health (aches), vitality, intimacy, longevity,,,

What's as important as BMI? muscle mass / strength. Note body fat is theoretically important but hard to measure

What foods have the biggest (PCA) impact based on observation and personal research? I don't have verifiable data. Established calorie science is highly imperfect in my experience.
A: Starch, hidden fat, nuts, not fruits, not milk

-- update (not new!)
If BMI improvement affect my intimacy, then let go of the BMI. My intimacy is more important.

sexual gratification (actually, longer active sex life) is sometimes more important to me than improving BMI to 64 kg

BMI helps my CRE and chin-up, but those things are far less important than deep-green.

BMI is more important than early sleep, but early sleep probably helps my diet.
