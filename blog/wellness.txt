kimchi
nuts .. MAY lower LDL iFF in small portions like 2 ounces of nuts a day. Studies have shown that walnuts MAY help protect the heart and lower the risk of heart attack for people who already have heart disease. 

-- new or update: kimchi
For someone vulnerable to hypertension, it's imprudent to ignore the sodium factor.

Even though Koreans eat kimchi every day for centuries, there is still widespread concern about sodium concentration in kimchi.

-- new: Shringles vaccine: CAD, cancer,,
Shringrix is an expensive vaccine but it is 80% effective against shringles infection.
I wish there are such shields against other adversities.

80% protection is very good already.

This protection is about pain, quality of life, and not about life expectancy.

CAD is about life expectancy, not quality of life. 
Cancer is about both life expectancy and quality of life.

Does CAD affect my life chances? It does if it hit me in my 30s, not if in my 80s

BBC program on intermittent fasting features many researcher who practice intermittent fasting. However, if a research paper uses a sample size of one, then the research has zero statistical significance.

-- fuxi: Henry Lew suggestions:
Sugg 1: After seeing the home-cooked dinner, allocate a fixed portion for the night. Do not keep eating beyond that. 

Sugg 1b: Reduce allocation by 20%. The body and mind may not notice it.

Sugg 2: pre-emptive compensation .. Predict "night time compensation". If positive, then eat some starch (or whatever enticing food) before going home.
Then at home reduce the "allocation" by the pre-comp amount.

Sugg 3: when the craving starts, locate the part of the body. Then locate another part of the body that's comfortable. That makes a pair. Breathe in to the craving part, and breathe out to the comfort part.

Q: since what age did you start to notice appetite out of control
%%A: definitely before 30. Whenever I try to control my appetite, I would often find it hard to control.

Psychological inflexibility .. the behavior + the feeling follows one direction, but the control [self2 judge] is steering towards another direction. Conflict and loss of control. These negative consequences are not necessary. Controlled release/surrender can be beneficial.

If you have been working out on CRE, strength, etc but neglected flexibility, you are bound to hit a sinking feeling .. left behind.

Quality of life.

Suppose you go to a developing country where everyone you see is slim, mobile, able-bodied, and flexible, you may hit a sinking feeling like -- In the grand scheme of things, how valuable is your net worth?
Concrete example -- YY.Tao has an enviable net worth, but complained about his knee condition. As we age, such conditions are less likely to improve and recover.

enviable BMI can come at disproportionate cost
* Older adults often need to fight, on their back heels, an uphill battle to retain muscles. Losing muscle can reduce your BMI but it also affects your metabolism rate
* amputation can reduce your BMI, but do you want that?
