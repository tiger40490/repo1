-- new: when I come home, I look forward to (expectation of) a reward for the sacrifices, an unwinding of the strict control 
I feel I deserve some comfort food.

It feels too harsh to deny myself of the comfort foods.

Luckily I don't demand starch or fattty comfort foods.
Fancy fruits are fine.

-- new: stay above 56 kg
As my height shrinks to 1.74, a 18.5 BMI would mean 56.0 kg.
That would be deep-green for me. 

Probably well before that, I would look too thin to be acceptable to myself.

-- fuxi or new: wellness effort = uninspiring
I told grandpa that 1)diet and 2) weekly exercise are more important than earn-more/move-up.

However, wellness effort (esp. diet restriction) is not inspiring, not exciting, not engaging. We have to accept that, if we want to maximize our lifetime total happiness.

Some women may find diet restriction a short-term sacrifice for a huge gratification -- improved body shape.

-- new: wrong* temptations@family outing

Option: eat nothing, but it's hard to enjoy the family outing. Tough choice.
Option: controlled indulgence, but the cCost is extremely dangerous
Option: just stay out of the scene. Perhaps leave early.

.. tip: bring fruits + raw veg
.. tip: eat dessert only.


-- fuxi: the MLP monitor in Room2 can become a hindrance to the more-standing initiative. Detach it at times.

-- fuxi: the picnic basket (and wife's picnic food) is 
* high starch
* relatively high fat due to cheese, creams, baking oily/starchy
* very low amount of veg (less than 1% by weight)

It's error-prone to extrapolate. To me, most fancy foods, special occassion foods are tasty due to starch + fat. Raw veg is the least welcome feature.

In a way, the vast majority of people (in my familiar places) are attracted by foods high in starch, fat and sugar. Therefore, it requires daily battles and "personal strengths" (see my blogpost) to resist the temptations. 

In hindsight, I feel I ate too much starch even when not so tasty. In contrast, at LZ.Yu's dinner, I had very little starch, not even the corn

Wrong-time temptation .. I fought a good battle.
Wrong-quantity temptation .. can do better next time. My son was far more successful.
wrong-food temptation .. luckily I had my carrots. My son didn't like some of the starchy/oily foods and discard them after one byte. Good for him.

--fuxi or new: bigger risk: too(much^little)nice food@home
I feel 80% of the risk is the too-much risk

In the too-little scenario (too little healthy comfort food at home), I could end up eating ice cream, or toast+peanut butter, or quick noodles, or peanuts

In Bayonne, I had too little food at home and I coped well.

-- fuxi
I have tried Ikea cafe food more than 10 times. I think it's slightly healthier than average. 
Obviously, at every restaurant, your personal choice of foods is the deciding factor. Ikea tends to offer more varieties of relatively healthy choices.

Still, I believe "reasonable" self-disciple in this context is simply insufficient. Your nutrional balance is probably reasonable, but there would be too much fat and insufficient vegetables. The overal c-cost would be too high.

I think most  attractive foods are similar. It's rare to find attractive yet healthy foods. 

-- fuxi: why no toothache in the last 10-20Y, basically never since 1991 /whereas/(not "while") I had toothaches in China? 
No age pattern among the population.
So I guess I'm just lucky.

My dental care is one contributing factor including brushing and frequent checks.

-- fuxi: knowing that BMI is not that critical when your nutiional mix is excellent, I still want to ask
Q: is it possible to put on weight by eating lots of carrots, and other raw veg + fruits?
A: I don't think so.

I think the amount of meat, starch and fat might be underestimated.
