for the 2nd time I bought the $7.50 Novena salad
I would say the home cooking $cost of an equivalent meal is $2-5 but some of the ingredients are unavilable at home.

At home there are almost always some temptation like wrong-time, wrong-food temptations. By paying extra outside, I buy freedom from these temptations.

--new: oil-free grilling, steaming, boiling, microwaving=healthiest cooking methods
Most cooks including my family would use "a few drops" of oil to enhance taste, but it is a slippery slope.

For my longetivity, I want to develop my appetite and taste for

* raw food

Started in 2018, these changes sound impermanent, meerly fashionable, whimsical, and undefensible in the face of real-world challenges, but I think these small lifestyle changes go a long way towards wellness including immunity and longetivity.

i feel guilty for not going there but going has a tcost and an opportunity cost. Am not as efficient as I claim to be when scolding my son.

If I have the power surge I could simply work out in office or at home! 
Limiting factor is not time but absorbency
