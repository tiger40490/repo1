biggest time-consuming procedures that require focus focus

#1 ice .. sugg make ice in office and bring home
.. worry: spill while putting in .. sugg: use tight boxes
.. worry: melt too fast if outside
.. worry: some ice chunks get stuck and wasted .. sugg: ignore them, and refill the box.
.. worry: ice melting in blender if left too long .. sugg: leave ice in blender and wait only without liquid.
.. sugg: use smaller ice bags. Can fit into the other drawers.
#2 carving out avocado

--new: yoga tips from Steve
Steve spoke some truths that other instructors couldn't
* sugg: hold longer, like yin yoga, and rest in the pose.
* sugg: need to relax much more. If you are tense, then the muscle can't stretch 

The pain in the affected body part ... is part of the process. It would improve over time. Should not be uncomfortable at the whole-person level meaning you must be able to relax with the pain. It's possible.
There's a harmony between the pain and the relaxation.

--new: j4 fitness classes or update https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=5023&action=edit
t_intro
Why is fitness class easier than self-practice?
Self-practice requires constant SMS, constant motivating (like dRam refresh), constant push beyond the comfort zone. Lots of system2 work.
For example, after a rest we need System 2 to decide when to restart, set a target and keep count.
In a class, we can relax System2 and follow the instructor and other students. System 1 is efficient.

Remember the Bayonne yoga class led by the Russian student.

-- update yoga frq (which blogpost?)
at twice a week, the total hours would be 3 to 5/wk, based on my Bayonne experience. This is much more than the hours I can allocate to all other workouts combined. Therefore, the tcost is unsustainable.

Reality is, yoga isn't life-saving like kidney dialysis that must be performed weekly. Most guys are unable to do 3 sessions/week and therefore 3 sessions/week is unrealistic for most people, just like 5 workouts/week. 

The sustainable tcost has to be based on self-practice.

-- new: OK to have a favorite workout@@ or update blogpost on workout priorities https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/10950/bmi-flexible-cre-strength/
.. the need to balance enjoyments with wellness priorities 
some people (mostly women) enjoy yoga and nothing else.
some people (mostly men) enjoy muscle training and nothing else .. I think many Americans do.
some people enjoy jogging and nothing else. I still find stadium more conducive than other jogging places.

I don't want to sound negative, alarming and detract from your enthusiasm for your favorite workout, but in each case there is a small risk of neglecting other exercises.

Too much muscle training can affect BMI and flexibility, two of the most important aspects of wellness. I am unlikely to become bulky, but flexibility is a traditionally neglected area.

Too much jogging can lead to loss of flexibility and muscle as we age.

Some women do mostly yoga including some limited strength training, so they lack CRE. Therefore, some combine yoga with cardio. 

Ideally, you would want to enjoy a range of workouts, but few individuals are so lucky. For every adult and child, consistent workout is repetitive and requires a lot of effort and absorbency. Team sports and golf are more fun but requires a lot of external help.
