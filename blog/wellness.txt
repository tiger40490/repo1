--as I told boy...
when i face a wrong-* temptation outside home, I only need to say NO once. There's no wrong-qty temptation. The high price tag is a natural defense.

when i face a wrong-* temptation at home, I need to say NO over and over. There's less wrong-food temptation. The 'soon to be discarded' reminder is an enemy.

--fuxi:
Many popular diets ignore the fact that per 100 gram, fat has more than twice the number of calories as carb or protein.

Therefore, I always insist on limiting fat intake.

--fuxi: mix veg rice without rice
I should try this more. 
Without rice, I felt less guilty, more free

--fuxi:
how would LKY or a rich guy deal with the temptations of home cooking?

What if money is not an issue? i would live away from family for several days when my diet gets out of control.

Q: Can protein powder replace a meal?
With plenty of ice (chia seed is secondary) it did fill my stomach AND provide energy. However, the wrong-time temptation is overpowering. 
I think key is starch. Protein powder has no starch. If I have not tasted starch for a while, then it's hard.

Q: how about red bean paste?
Let me say it again -- chia, ice, protein powder can provide a full meal, but if you have had no starch for a while, then the temptations simply wipe out everything and you can feel hungry (hedonic) again. This is the nature of our senses.
