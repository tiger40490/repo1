Not as powerful as the big one below my bedbug

One of the least mentioned but most valuable resources I can give my kids is my live presence due to my healthy longevity.

Even at age 80 I can be a role model for them,  sharing my wisdom, otherwise my lessons learnt.

Look at grandpa or grandma. Their presence has a net-positive effect, because they are not yet dependent and burdensome.

now vs 2019, my bmi is worse due to 4kg, even though
* i have maintained my starch abstinence and veg/fruit + milkshake
* I have maintained my meal delay
* I have maintained to some extent intermittent fasting. I believe (without enough evidence) that iFF I cut the late night meal then BMI would improve

I may have to accept status quo for now and keep working on BMI
