To reduce cholesterol, avoiding egg was completely unnecessary and ineffective. This was my first big lesson on the limitations of health science. 

Similarly, many people (boy, Deepak CM..) find it very hard to lose weight even if they follow all the tips. I feel their calorie intake is still too high.

dental: brushing for 10 min? Actually more than 3 minutes each time hits /diminishing returns/ compared to flossing

frq of brushing is more important as bad stuff builds up over a few hours. Sansan learned from a book to brush 3 times daily -- role model

Thanks to my saliva, I didn't brush daily but still had no dental problem. Going forward, I want to be more proactive.

--snacking can be good or bad for you
Some individuals take frequent snacks and others never take snacks. Both types can be healthy or unhealthy. There's poor correlation between health and snacking habith. How about the correlation between health and zodiac?

What matters is probably 1) calorie 2) quality of nutrition. Healthy snack nutrition is good; unhealthy snack nutrition is bad.

Some snackers (me for decades) eat hundreds of calories each snack. After the snack, either we delay/skip meals or keep big meals. The total calorie intake is heavily dependent on the snack + other meals during the day.

Effect on Total calorie is probably psychological. Mostly psychological in my case. For decades, my brain was trained to crave for snacks in late afternoon and late night. After the afernoon snack, the home meal is a real battle I win or lose every day -- not hungry but tempted by the sight of food.

--update blogpost: even inconsistent meal skipping can be benefial to some people

Some parents believe delaying a meal by 30 minutes can harm their child. It's similar to the fear that a minute of sun radiation or 2nd-hand smoke can harm your health.

My Egyption roommrate at Juliet St ( Bayonne ) believed the smell of any laundry that's not 100% dried could harm his health.

most tempting bad foods for me -- 1) fat 2) starch 3) sugar(T) and combinations of them

--fuxi: nutrient timing is invented for ultra-endurance athletes. The reserach findings are not directly applicable to the ordinary people.

--calorie is not everything for my son, but is the most important factor
For a weight watcher, It's already very hard if you focus on calorie restriction. Now if you get distracted by other things like "good fat", it will be even harder.

--Raffles screening
A man's health is not based on his "look". Chinese culture tends to associate plumpness with health.

consider knee support while jogging.

if cycling is too light for you, consider spin class.

--new: yoga Can (not could, not merely in-theory) have a slow, long-term effect on my mental + physical health
Yoga is not strategic to my current lifestyle. In contrast, BMI, endurance are more strategic as I could feel the physical "decline" more often

However, yoga Can (not could, not merely in-theory) have a slow, long-term effect on my mental + physical health
it can help me learn to relax
it helps me open myself to a proven method of relaxation
It can slowly build my self-confidence that I could overcome something really hard
It can slowly build my self-esteem that I could keep working on a really serious weakness (almost like a handicap)

Similarly, starch reduction has a similar effect on my self-confidence and long-term lifestyle benefit

SG yoga instructors had no encouraging words for a weak student like me.

--my "extreme" diet is a keystone of minimalist lifestyle
starch reduction
calorie restriction
fiber intake
raw food

--fuxi when it comes to calorie counting, One of the least noticed math features is
various degrees of "bad" when we decide to loosen up and eat bad food
I feel creamy cakes are among the worst, but for most people, it is probably impractical to completely avoid creamy foods as they were opium. Various degree of bad -- alcohol is worse than creamy.. tobacco is worst than alcohol and drugs are worse than tobacco. 

In the mass media, we can see the different attitudes towards these "bad" foods

More stupid are the calorie-dense foods that aren't satisfying -- fried peanuts; alcohol; mint ice-cream; cheese chunks; 

--chia seeds fiber
Is the fiber contributing to calorie intake? I feel answer is no but research needed

Research show a non-trivial amount of fat content, but I don't feel any fat in its texture. Also, I would never eat more than 3 spoonful of chiat seeds a day.

I feel chia seed is very filling yet tastes very different from any of the fatty or starchy foods in my life. This is the main reason for my belief in its slimming benefit.

--new: the girl with A-grade flexibility (my grade? ...) 
may not be able to make a living as a yoga instructor, as Ankur could 
may not derive satisfaction and self-esteem from her superior flexibility
may be poor in balancing, strength and endurance (consider endurance sports)
is probably not going to win in any yoga competition, but why bother with competition? So why feel inferior to them?

--real cost of a yoga session
(great eg of git blogging beating web blogging!) 
$cost is trivial cf the other costs

By far the biggest cost is mental energy. I need to really persuade myself.

Another big cost is tcost. Commute, ..

Therefore, I would not worry about going in 5 min late.

Most of the "marketing" and taste-enhancers are sugary, as majority of these consumers react to sugar.
Many sugary ingredients contain preservatives.
