For decades, i seldom felt hungry in the morning.

Some told me to try and feel the hunger, create the appetite

Some said breakfast would delay the hunger for lunch. Completely wrong prediction in my case. Breakfast always intensifies, not decreases appetite at lunch time.

Some said a decent lunch would suppress hunger in the afternoon. Completely wrong in my case. The obvious fact in my case is, even if eat a resonable lunch at 2pm, by 5 i would experience real urge to eat

One of the least mentioned but most valuable resources I can give my kids is my live presence due to my healthy longevity.

Even at age 80 I can be a role model for them,  sharing my wisdom, otherwise my lessons learnt.

Look at grandpa or grandma. Their presence has a net-positive effect, because they are not yet dependent and burdensome.

now vs 2019, my bmi is worse due to 4kg, even though
* i have maintained my starch abstinence and veg/fruit + milkshake
* I have maintained my meal delay
* I have maintained to some extent intermittent fasting. I believe (without enough evidence) that iFF I cut the late night meal then BMI would improve

I may have to accept status quo for now and keep working on BMI
