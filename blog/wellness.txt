$130/M gym fee is tolerable to me, but most people use the gym only once a week. Let's assume 8 times/M

How about $16/visit flat rate? I would feel I could save the money by working out at home. 
Jolt: but can you do that consistently?

Paying the monthly fee motivates me to go there regularly.

punchbag .. no weight resistance, so speed needed.

today's (late Jun) Chinatown lunch is famliar. Hopefully my past experience help me improve.

Better than home cooking in terms of unlimited quantity. 3 out of 4 dishes have limited quantity. At home, generally the quantity is higher.

rice .. I had a controlled indulgence. In the next few days I will reflect. There will be very limited evidence, so I may not have enough of a rational reason to change my behavior.

leftovers .. at home, I finished some of the leftovers without rice :)

street food + YueHwa .. thanks to my full stomach (https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/2021/05/02/fullnessavailability-hunger/), I didn't buy any :) Buying would lead to "obligation". So a "controlled indulgence" is a double-edged sword with unforeseen ramification.

-- new: buying wellness: how effective@@
There are many "research" or marketing that link fancy new products to wellness. You would think the rich would live healthier lives? Alas, the correlation is very low.

I will use star-rating and dollar-rating ..
$$$*** more free time .. commute; lower-pay jobs
* less driving, more walking, cycling
* simple, low-cost workout equipmenets similar to what I now keep
$$* nearby gym/pool/basketballCourt/// as provided by an office or condo
$** yoga (and other) classes
$ fancy fruits

Note most of the cost-effective items are low-cost.

Note I consciously reject most of the supplements, fancy expensive food. 

-- challenge of chin-up target
A realistic goal would be one a day, but such a goal doens't generate positive feedback. 

I remember my yoga goal was one minute a day. I managed to change my perception to feel good about it.

For chin-up, I need the same change of perception.

with squat, stairs, chin-up etc (mostly against body weight), even the slowest workout has a real intensity.

With boxing and jogging, slow means low intensity. Speed would easily tripple the intensity.

-- new: yoyo diet
Even a temporary weight improvement is no mean achievement.

Simiarly, a high score for my son's math is no mean achievement even if his scores revert to previous levels.

Bayonne stash was well-contolled without unexpected enticing foods, so I had no un-satisfying meals at home.

-- new:
many foods are advertised as "healthy" for no reason but a trace amount of omega3 oil, or heart-healthy oil, or antioxidant or some figer
The marketing propaganda exaggerates those small ingredients and say nothing about the excess amount of oil, sugar, animal fat, etc

-- new: supper floodgate
Why do I end my supper with lots of calorie dense comfort foods including starch, but I didn't feel the craving in the beginning?

I guess the floodgate was opened and hard to close.

-- fuxi:
Tip: end the planned supper with lots of comfort foods, rather than raw veg. I used to have lots of raw veg towards the end, hoping to fill up my stomach, but actually the stomach is impossible to fill up, and the untasty raw food demanded compensation in the form of comfort foods.

-- new: commercial^home cooking #quantity^quality
t_misperception

Critical thinking .. home cooking is better nutrition, but why my experience proved that my BMI was always better when living alone without home cooking? I would say quantity outweighs quality. 

quality of comercial food .. nowadays I buy more raw foods, less affected by inferior nutritional quality of commercial cooking. 
fast food .. is known for poor nutritional quality, but I seldom eat fast food when living alone.
home food still involves commercial cooked foods such as bakeries, ice creams
nuts .. as a group is never home-cooked. If I eat at home, the nuts in the home stash become unexpected and hazardous.
fish and meat .. perhaps home cooking is better quality, but by how many percent?
vegetables.. perhaps home cooking is better quality. Nowadays I tend to eat raw.
starch at home .. tend to be too enticing. The home stash has lots of outside starch food
starch bought outside .. tend to have more fiber, and stored in a stash under control
soymilk .. home-made is better, and I don't overeat.
milkshake .. home-made is better. 

-- update blogpost on noHunger-home-> 
.. is a sign of good appetite for relatively healthy foods. You don't want get rid of this appetite, do you? What you want to get rid of is the unexpected food

-- new: when I come home, I look forward to (expectation of) a reward for the sacrifices, an unwinding of the strict control 
I feel I deserve some comfort food.

It feels too harsh to deny myself of the comfort foods.

Luckily I don't demand starch or fattty comfort foods.
Fancy fruits are fine.

-- fuxi or new: wellness effort = uninspiring
I told grandpa that 1)diet and 2) weekly exercise are more important than earn-more/move-up.

However, wellness effort (esp. diet restriction) is not inspiring, not exciting, not engaging. We have to accept that, if we want to maximize our lifetime total happiness.

Some women may find diet restriction a short-term sacrifice for a huge gratification -- improved body shape.

I have tried Ikea cafe food more than 10 times. I think it's slightly healthier than average. 
Obviously, at every restaurant, your personal choice of foods is the deciding factor. Ikea tends to offer more varieties of relatively healthy choices.

Still, I believe "reasonable" self-disciple in this context is simply insufficient. Your nutrional balance is probably reasonable, but there would be too much fat and insufficient vegetables. The overal c-cost would be too high.

I think most  attractive foods are similar. It's rare to find attractive yet healthy foods. 

-- fuxi: knowing that BMI is not that critical when your nutrional mix is excellent, I still want to ask
Q: is it possible to put on weight by eating lots of carrots, and other raw veg + fruits?
A: I don't think so. In theory, possible, but I seriously doubt it.

I think the amount of meat, starch and fat might be underestimated.
