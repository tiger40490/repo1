As we age, some "system functions" will decline faser than other functions. Which ones are the most important to protect?

~~ Half Ranked: 
BMI
muscle strength + endurance
bone strength
CRE .. many elderly can maintain CRE through swim, hiking, jogging
sexual health without aid
short-term memory, 
appetite .. consider grandpa
eyesight, hearing

Note lower-ranked items are high-value but too hard (or too easy) to preserve. No perfect example, but I will say sexual.

-- yoga: maintain^improve #Steve
Maintenance is the main goal. Steve also felt the same way.

improvemenet is rarely a valid goal. Positive feedback is rare.
One type of visible improvement is "endurance" in a tough pose.

Steve spoke some truths that other instructors couldn't
* sugg: hold longer, like yin yoga, and rest in the pose.
* sugg: need to relax much, much more. If you are tense, then the muscle can't stretch 

The pain in the affected body part ... is part of the process. It would improve over time. Should not be uncomfortable at the whole-person level meaning you must be able to relax with the pain. It's possible.

I guess there's a harmony between the pain and the relaxation.

Why BMI challenge is so tough in SG vs U.S... could be homeostatic hunger in the SG climate
With the same food intake, in the U.S. I tend to feel less hungry.

-- new: delay breakfast^reward early rise
If i didn't really get up early, then perhaps no need to reward

-- new or fuxi: 
The focusing illusion exaggerates the importance of flexibility, and exaggerates my Relative weakness, as compared to a published instruction. 

Q: what's the published vs experienced pains/dangers of inflexibility?

Q: what's the publisied vs experienced benefits of stretch, breathing or meditation?

The published studies are from different sources. Tother they prove beyond reasonable doubt that yoga has no major side effects. As to the benefits, studies often say "can improve ...". It reminds me of my myopic treatments in Beijing [laser, massage] and my Indian colleagues' experience of ginseng. 

Experienced benefits are obvious (will not elaborate today) in CRE, strength. Some of those benefits are shared with (the strenguous form of) yoga.

Experienced pains of poor CRE/strength are obvious (will not elaborate today).

Flexibility does (I believe) help reduce probability and severity of injuries. I also believe in delaying the decline of flexibility. The decline is inevitable for 99% of men, due to aging.

However, the yoga style deep stretch may not improve flexibility, partly because the improvement has a half-life = 1week.

Aura yoga: $55 for 10D unlimited. Good for when I return to office
