--update blogpost on hunger?
empty stomach is a factor. Not as big as the temptations, but still a factor. In the face of mild temptations, an empty stomach would worsen the temptation 

Before going to a place of temptation, try to fill the stomach. It is helpful.

--new: buying salad without dressing/cheese
I am clearly stronger than most salad eaters -- In the recent past, I didn't need any taste-enhancers like dressing or avocado or cheese.

I am clearly improving. In the past, I couldn't swallow this kind of salad without dressing.

--new: score each delicious
For each highly attractive food (creamy cakes, flavored nuts,,,) I will record up to 3 scores
* published calorie density vs my own estimate thereof, on my own digestive system, in my own body
* the food's value as a taste-enhancer to help me take in more raw veg.

nuts are the prime example of its type -- high published density but lower density in my estimate, and high value as a companion for raw veg. For higher enhancer score, I should take only garlic flavored nuts without coating.

left-over starch in a delicious starchy food is an important case. For example, Red-bean bun or pizza,,,. 
I often use these foods to help me take in more raw veg. 
After I eat up the most tasty part, there's the left-over, usually starchy. I always feel a semi-conscious urge to finish the left-over but .. but the satisfaction+reward vs calorie "load" simply don't make sense!
 
.. minor scores:
* harms and benefits. Few foods have known side effects -- tobacco, trans-fat, alcohol, 

Before I blacklist a highly attractive food, I better decide really how bad it is.

No more than 4 different scores as I would tend to forget.
