holy grail: satisfying daily meals without BMI impact

Bayonne stash was well-contolled without unexpected enticing foods, so I had no unsatisfying meals at home.

atheletes often have stronger heart, lung and bones, able to withstand and recover from wear and tear.

Also better flexibility.
-- new: supper floodgate
Why do I end my supper with lots of calorie dense comfort foods including starch, but I didn't feel the craving in the beginning?

I guess the floodgate was opened and hard to close.

-- new: 
Tip: end the planned supper with lots of comfort foods, rather than raw veg. I used to have lots of raw veg towards the end, hoping to fill up my stomach, but actually the stomach is impossible to fill up, and the untasty raw food demanded compensation in the form of comfort foods.

t_misperception

Critical thinking .. home cooking is better nutrition, but why my experience proved that my BMI was always better when living alone without home cooking? I would say quantity outweighs quality. 

quality of comercial food .. nowadays I buy more raw foods, less affected by inferior nutritional quality of commercial cooking. 
fast food .. is known for poor nutritional quality, but I seldom eat fast food when living alone.
home food still involves commercial cooked foods such as bakeries, ice creams
nuts .. as a group is never home-cooked. If I eat at home, the nuts in the home stash become unexpected and hazardous.
fish and meat .. perhaps home cooking is better quality, but by how many percent?
vegetables.. perhaps home cooking is better quality. Nowadays I tend to eat raw.
starch at home .. tend to be too enticing. The home stash has lots of outside starch food
starch bought outside .. tend to have more fiber, and stored in a stash under control
soymilk .. home-made is better, and I don't overeat.
milkshake .. home-made is better.

.. is a sign of good appetite for relatively healthy foods. You don't want get rid of this appetite, do you? What you want to get rid of is the unexpected food

-- new: when I come home, I look forward to (expectation of) a reward for the sacrifices, an unwinding of the strict control 
I feel I deserve some comfort food.

It feels too harsh to deny myself of the comfort foods.

Luckily I don't demand starch or fattty comfort foods.
Fancy fruits are fine.

-- new: stay above 56 kg
As my height shrinks to 1.74, a 18.5 BMI would mean 56.0 kg.
That would be deep-green for me. 

Probably well before that, I would look too thin to be acceptable to myself.

-- fuxi or new: wellness effort = uninspiring
I told grandpa that 1)diet and 2) weekly exercise are more important than earn-more/move-up.

However, wellness effort (esp. diet restriction) is not inspiring, not exciting, not engaging. We have to accept that, if we want to maximize our lifetime total happiness.

Some women may find diet restriction a short-term sacrifice for a huge gratification -- improved body shape.

-- fuxi
I have tried Ikea cafe food more than 10 times. I think it's slightly healthier than average. 
Obviously, at every restaurant, your personal choice of foods is the deciding factor. Ikea tends to offer more varieties of relatively healthy choices.

Still, I believe "reasonable" self-disciple in this context is simply insufficient. Your nutrional balance is probably reasonable, but there would be too much fat and insufficient vegetables. The overal c-cost would be too high.

I think most  attractive foods are similar. It's rare to find attractive yet healthy foods. 

-- fuxi: knowing that BMI is not that critical when your nutrional mix is excellent, I still want to ask
Q: is it possible to put on weight by eating lots of carrots, and other raw veg + fruits?
A: I don't think so. In theory, possible, but I seriously doubt it.

I think the amount of meat, starch and fat might be underestimated.
