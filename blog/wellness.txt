--fuxi: once my stomach is stretched due to a few big meals, it tends to send stronger hunger signal earlier than before.
My mom said this many years ago. She could be right, and based on experience.

Now I have got used to big meals in 2020, I don't remember why I was able to live happily with half the food.

--new: yoga pose: modified^incorrect

Right postures are important but Modifications are often necessary. Saumik told me.

How do you tell the difference between a poor form vs a modification? I don't think we need a professional to devise the modifications.
I would go with my own modifications.
