--somehow, I feel icecream is lighter than the addictive starchy foods in Singapore.

I think my feeling is contradicting published calorie density.

I think ice cream has lots of water so calorie density is significantly lower. Some say one cup of ice cream is too small for most people, but without water, one cup may become half a cup.

--new strategy against the starchy foods from grandma
eat lots of veg + fruits + milkshake

--new: 4 types of carbs
re the blogpost on resistant starch

I think the western weight-loss industry targets all forms of carbs almost indiscriminately. Many commentators exclude fiber. Some exclude fruit sugar. My view is kinda mainstream in my focus on table sugar and starch.

* table sugar and derivatives are widely critized and should be taken in moderation. Table sugar can affect heart and diabetes.
* fruit sugar -- is widely considered similar to table sugar but I seriously doubt it. No evidence suggests fruit sugar cause weight gain.
* starch -- I find it quite fattening, but I believe the calorie density is below half of fat. Most people tend to eat many many grams of starch so it is probably responsible for weight
* dietary fiber -- there's plenty of research showing these carbs are not absorbed, but still most calorie numbers treat it same as table sugar

--new jolt: what calorie-dense foods are binge-risky
prime eg: nuts -- I can binge i.e. eat a lot quickly. Some people are naturally unable to.
starch -- I can eat a lot in one meal, including the fibrous starch like starchy roots.
! fruits -- most of us can't eat too much fruits with the sugar, largely thanks to the water content
creamy cakes, fried foods, chicken skin -- are the worst fatty foods. High binge risk.

--update blogpost on best starch
grandma said some raw grains are more fibrous, but to me, all grains are starchy

Starch means addictive, wrong-quantity temptation, and heavy impact on weight.

I still prefer green peas and beans for the lower starch density

Around the time of SiemReap flight booking, I ate quite a lot of starchy foods grandma bought or cooked.

This is a classic case study.

One factor is stress. The flight booking was stressful.

One factor is wrong-* temptations. In this case, there was a bit of wrong-time temptation in the morning after the flight booking. I was not hungry, but I gave in to the temptation after the food was heated.

One factor is quality of nutrition. This starchy food is not as bad as creamy cakes or ice cream. I also ate carrot for balance.
 
One of the biggest factors in my mind was quantity of calories. I can only guesstimate that the quantity was huge.

This blogpost is about diet. Beyond diet, a major factor affecting my zsms is the burn/rot/roti on that day. I had a coding drill with Ashish, one of the toughest in 3 months. I then went back to office and did a bit of work. In office I had a stressful call with NCT. I also had a useful dabao coaching session on word problem, one of the most significant in a year. The cambodia trip legwork (visa, flight) was a major effort. I also had a few lotus sessions including in ofifce.. In hindsight, I dismissed/forgot these non-trivial achievements on that day and zoomed into the diet "loss of control".
