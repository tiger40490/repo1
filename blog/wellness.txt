-- new or update buying salad meal 
starchy base .. can be low fat, high fibre and very filling

Leafy base .. I can choose 0 or more. Every week, I eat lots of raw veg already.
.. tip: If taking the salad to office or home, then I often have raw veg available for the mix :)

Dressing .. often the biggest calorie carrier. If no good choice, then pick something bland or no dressing at all.

-- fuxi: Whopper exprience @ TPY bus interchange
Price is much higher than the 山东大饼 or a hawker 杂菜饭. However, the dominant force needs to change from Price to nutrition. By customizing the cream level, whopper can be less oily than a lot of those foods.

Also, I have not tasted any beef burger for more than a year. Whopper is a premium version. The picture was enticing.

I think red meat is supposed to increase LDL.
