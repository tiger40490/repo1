A mix of nuts is possibly better than peanuts alone.

Salmon, avocado, nuts are considered healthy fats if taken in moderation.

Muscle relaxation medicine has the least side effects. Take it only when needed.

Shift more focus from jogging to muscle maintenance as we age. I think x-training is best.

-- new: buying wellness: how effective@@
There are many "research" or marketing that link fancy new products to wellness. You would think the rich would live healthier lives? Alas, the correlation is very low.

I will use star-rating and dollar-rating ..
$$$*** more free time .. commute; lower-pay jobs
* less driving, more walking, cycling
* simple, low-cost workout equipmenets similar to what I now keep
$$* nearby gym/pool/basketballCourt/// as provided by an office or condo
$** yoga (and other) classes
$ fancy fruits

Note most of the cost-effective items are low-cost.

Note I consciously reject most of the supplements, fancy expensive food. 

$130/M gym fee is tolerable to me, but most of us use the gym only once a week. Let's assume 8 times/M

How about $16/visit flat rate? I would feel I could save the money by working out at home. 
Jolt: but can you do that consistently?

Paying the monthly fee motivates me to go there regularly.

-- new: challenge of chin-up target
A realistic goal would be one a day, but such a goal doens't generate positive feedback. 

I remember my yoga goal was one minute a day. I managed to change my perception to feel good about it.

For chin-up, I need the same change of perception.

with squat, stairs, chin-up etc (mostly against body weight), even the slowest workout has a real intensity.

With boxing and jogging, slow means low intensity. Speed would easily tripple the intensity.

punchbag .. no weight resistance, so speed needed.

-- new: commercial^home cooking #quantity^quality
t_misperception

Critical thinking .. home cooking is better nutrition, but why my experience proved that my BMI was always better when living alone without home cooking? I would say quantity outweighs quality. 

quality of comercial food .. nowadays I buy more raw foods, less affected by inferior nutritional quality of commercial cooking. 
fast food .. is known for poor nutritional quality, but I seldom eat fast food when living alone.
home food still involves commercial cooked foods such as bakeries, ice creams
nuts .. as a group is never home-cooked. If I eat at home, the nuts in the home stash become unexpected and hazardous.
fish and meat .. perhaps home cooking is better quality, but by how many percent?
vegetables.. perhaps home cooking is better quality. Nowadays I tend to eat raw.
starch at home .. tend to be too enticing. The home stash has lots of outside starch food
starch bought outside .. tend to have more fiber, and stored in a stash under control
soymilk .. home-made is better, and I don't overeat.
milkshake .. home-made is better. 

-- new: compensation when coming home
when I come home, I look forward to (expectation of) a reward for the sacrifices, an unwinding of the strict control 
I feel I deserve some comfort food.

It feels too harsh to deny myself of the comfort foods.

Luckily I don't demand starch or fattty comfort foods. Fancy fruits are fine.

It is a sign of good appetite for relatively healthy foods. You don't want get rid of this appetite, do you? What you want to get rid of is the unexpected food
