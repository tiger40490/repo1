sexual gratification (actually, longer active sex life) is sometimes more important to me than improving BMI to 64 kg

BMI helps my CRE and chin-up, but those things are far less important than deep-green.

64 kg may come at a price in terms of muscle loss, but am not convinced.

BMI is more important than early sleep, but early sleep probably helps my diet.

-- limitations of calorie theory:
meal replacement powders

chia and other resistant starch .. can make me feel full for a while. Some lose the satiety effect soon :( Some actuall make me gain weight. So the calorie theory is inconssitent, confusing,,,

nuts .. very high cal density ... too high to believe

juices or whole milk is supposed to provide lots of calories, but I don't feel full 

-- new or fuxi: yoga, core workout: injury prevention/protection
--new: control over BMI ... or update post on passive acceptance
Rahul was very determined and in-control, but he might be slightly overweight.

Many of my colleagues are overweight. I tend to assume they have poor control over diet or exercise, but I could be very wrong. 

Some slim individuals are not really better at self-control. I guess they are just lucky.

This "control" is central to successZ, but if our "system" is hard to control, then I think we need harmony. See the bpost on serenity

-- update one of the bposts on smoothie

Gula syrup is more efficient but more expensive than condensed milk

Need to improve efficiency with chia, wash-up, ice(!)
