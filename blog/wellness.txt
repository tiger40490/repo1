Due to family cooking (worse than the Singapore commercial foods), am fighting the daily battles more often, wrestling with the temptations more often. 

It's good to recognize the environmental factor.

--fuxi: dental care
i need more brushing, perhaps more frequent
I , meimei and boy need more frequent dental checks
meimei need to avoid sweet and also hard food

--no blog: step back. Recognize that I don't really have a power surge for jogging 3 times in a row

i feel guilty for not going there but going has a tcost and an opportunity cost. Am not as efficient as I claim to be when scolding my son.

If I have the power surge I could simply work out in office or at home! 
Limiting factor is not time but absorbency

--fuxi: a covid19 infection in the family would disrrupt everything.
Be prepared psychologically.
I feel SG is one of the better places to get treatment
