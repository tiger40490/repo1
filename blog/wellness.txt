i need more brushing, perhaps more frequent
I , meimei and boy need more frequent dental checks

--no blog: step back. Recognize that I don't really have a power surge for jogging 3 times in a row

i feel guilty for not going there but going has a tcost and an opportunity cost. Am not as efficient as I claim to be when scolding my son.
