i feel guilty for not going there but going has a tcost and an opportunity cost. Am not as efficient as I claim to be when scolding my son.

--new: j4$7.50 salad
for the 2nd time I bought the $7.50 Novena salad
I would say the home cooking $cost of an equivalent meal is $2-5 but some of the ingredients are unavilable at home.

At home there are almost always some temptation like wrong-time, wrong-food temptations. By paying extra outside, I "buy" freedom from these temptations.

Counseller Bindi asked "What would you tell the 10-year old TanBin?" I would tell him that everyone is weak, so everyone appreciates and often needs freedom from temptations. No one is pure and impeccable in self-restraint.
