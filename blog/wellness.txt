--new: weight-loss theories: conflicint evidence
There are many diverging opinions on calorie restriction and weight loss. Conflicting evidence. If you are serious about weight loss, you must choose what to believe. Here are a few pillar beliefs I choose to hold tight.
* my personal safe BMI is 18.5. One summary is the letter to Susan Lee, but I have many blog posts under t_j4slim, written from different angles.
* vegies are safe; most fruits are safe, even if sweet or starchy
* it's tough but safe to reduce oily and starchy food towards zero
* I don't worry about malnutrition as I do eat non-trivial amount of starch + fat 
* protein powder is generally safe

The theory about weight loss is a life-science theory, not a physical science theory, so there are many exceptions.
--new: no stress no gain
BMI, diet, yoga, workout ... demand mental effort, focus and stress. 

A bullet fired towards a target is in free motion... hit or miss, but for a missile to aim at a moving target and adjust its flight, control is required.
As soon as we set an (however vague) expectation and take aim, we take on a challenge and set ourself up for stress.
Our self-esteem is now at stake.

Similarly the coding drill...

--more exercise to increase vitality
start small. no need to go for the "most important" 

--Singapore residents enjoy more workout facilities, mostly free. 
iFF they do use the facilities, then the national health would surely improve, in terms of mental health, sleep, appetite, freedom from illness, medical cost, 
This is arguably the most essential ingredient of quality of life in a country

--fat-free, zero-calorie cooking oil
Google search shows no scientific or medical sites supporting or disproving these products. I only see marketing websites.

* restraint on cakes, chocolate, ice cream etc, not as unconstrained as before 
* before the flight, I did eat lots of fruits + radish

--protein smoothie
Most of the "marketing" and taste-enhancers are sugary, as majority of these consumers react to sugar.
Many sugary ingredients contain preservatives.

intelligence, memory capacity, clear thinking, sharp perception ... can help the individual deal with depression and pessimism. I think most pessimistic thoughts are irrational and/or biased.

"Explanatory style" .. see [[learned optimism]]

"Mindfulness" is a therapy. This therapy can even cope with brain aging.

Memory is a muscle.. I think corrective thinking like my twister SMS is also a muscle one can improve by everyday training.
--new blogpost: less is more
calorie restriction means reduce starch, fried or creamy food. Most of the delicious foods are reduced to my tolerable limit, without depriving myself.

Less is more. More health, more vitality, more confidence.

--new blogpost: frq@stretching
try to stretch for 10 min on the body part you last used
aim for 2-3 such stretches a week. 
If you can't then I would say aim for 2 minutes twice a week.
