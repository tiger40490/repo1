-- update post on 5/wk
when it's hard to hit 5/wk,
* be flexible with shorter workouts. Start early during the day. Once I complete a few rounds, it would be easy to hit one session
* accept that it could feel like a chore

retraining chin-up and stretch is dreadful but not push-up or cardio

My self-talk matters. My self-talk reflects my perception of reality. This perception affects my actions.

I guess my target for chin-up is too high. I typically aim at 10 chin-up or and 40 push-up in a session. 

I think the start-up is harder for chin-up. 5 chin-up = 20 push-up.

-- fuxi or update
Recently I maintained 5/wk but at the cost of BMI.
I feel it's worthwhile.

-- update ...
monthly pacakge forces me to find time for yoga.

Many classes are unsuitable. Also night time very few classes.   Therefore, securing 2 classes a week proved stressful, even if I adjust my daily schedule around those classes.

-- update: modified form
modified form is required when most of the poses are unreachable. However, when I try my own modified forms, they criticize me.

-- update frq:
at twice a week, the total hours would be 3 to 5/wk, based on my Bayonne experience. This is much more than the hours I can allocate to all other workouts combined. Therefore, the tcost is unsustainable.

Reality is, yoga isn't life-saving like kidney dialysis that must be performed weekly. Most guys are unable to do 3 sessions/week and therefore 3 sessions/week is unrealistic for most people, just like 5 workouts/week.Â 

The sustainable tcost has to be based on self-practice.

-- new: OK to have a favorite workout@@ or update blogpost on workout priorities https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=10950&action=edit
.. the need to balance enjoyments with wellness priorities 
some people (mostly women) enjoy yoga and nothing else.
some people (mostly men) enjoy muscle training and nothing else .. I think many Americans do.
some people enjoy jogging among other cardios such as skip rope, and nothing else. I still find stadium more conducive than other jogging places.

I don't want to sound negative, alarming and detract from your enthusiasm for your favorite workout, but in each case there is a small risk of neglecting other exercises.

Too much muscle training can affect BMI and flexibility, two of the most important aspects of wellness. I am unlikely to become bulky, but flexibility is a traditionally neglected area.

Too much jogging can lead to loss of flexibility and muscle as we age.

Some women do mostly yoga including some limited strength training, so they lack CRE. Therefore, some combine yoga with cardio. 

Ideally, you would want to enjoy a range of workouts, but few individuals are so lucky. For every adult and child, consistent workout is repetitive and requires a lot of effort and absorbency. Team sports and golf are more fun but requires a lot of external help.

-- new: challenge of chin-up target
A realistic goal would be one a day, but such a goal doens't generate positive feedback. 

I remember my yoga goal was one minute a day. I managed to change my perception to feel good about it.

For chin-up, I need the same change of perception.

-- fuxi: compensation when coming home
when I come home from office, I look forward to (expectation of) a reward for the sacrifices, an unwinding of the strict control 
I feel I deserve some comfort food.

It feels too harsh to deny myself of the comfort foods.

Luckily I don't demand starch or fattty comfort foods. Fancy fruits are fine.

It is a sign of good appetite for relatively healthy foods. You don't want get rid of this appetite, do you? What you want to get rid of is the unexpected food
