kimchi -- avoid, given my "high risk"
nuts .. MAY lower LDL iFF in small portions like 2 ounces/Day. Studies have shown that walnuts MAY help protect the heart and lower the risk of heart attack for people who _already_ have heart disease. 
.. walnut is low in saturated, won't contribute to LDL but fat but high calories

sweet potato vs average fruits ... both rich in fiber. I love sweet potato but I think sweet potato is far more starchy therefore less suitable for BMI
.. high insoluble fiber, better than white rice

I love sweet taste in my congee. Is honey and date better than sugar?
.. yes better than white sugar
.. monk fruit and stevia is real sugar substitute. No known risk

I have a habit of adding raw veg to an otherwise unhealthy snack. In hindsight, am not sure if the veg neutralized the unhealthy elements
.. Indeed not neutralized

dinner timing. If I try to accomodate meimei's timing for math, then I may need to delay my dinner by 30-60 minutes. Worthwhile?
.. 10pm OK. Avoid 2h dinner

red wine.. healthy in very small amounts
.. no need to add this item

70%+ dark chocolate ..  healthy in very small amounts

honey .. healthier than sugar, but both needs portion control
.. not real sugar substitute. Not really healthier

soluible figer can help reduce LDL -- wholemeal, strawberry, chia seed (the transparent portion), apple (not the peel)
sugg: slightly more protein for resistance training, including toufu, milk, 
... better for lunch or dinner

T2dm is not reversible but can be controlled.

holiday feast .. warm soup first;  minimize starch; limit cakes to 6 pieces/meal (assuming regular size).
I was reluctant to set target, but now I can accept the idea.

After age 60, can aim for BMI=25, and maintain muscle mass.
Current BMI 21.x is very good for my age.
Going back to 63 kg .. probably not something to aim at.

exercise around times when you know hunger tends to strike .. may help some individuals deal with hedonic hunger. 

Some types of exercise such as short intensse workout may suppress levels of hormones known to drive appetite.

-- fuxi: Henry Lew suggestions:
Sugg 1: After seeing the home-cooked dinner, allocate a fixed portion for the night. Do not keep eating beyond that. 

Sugg 1b: Reduce allocation by 20%. The body and mind may not notice it.

Sugg 2: pre-emptive compensation .. Predict "night time compensation". If positive, then eat some starch (or whatever enticing food) before going home.
Then at home reduce the "allocation" by the pre-comp amount.

Sugg 3: when the craving starts, locate the part of the body. Then locate another part of the body that's comfortable. That makes a pair. Breathe in to the craving part, and breathe out to the comfort part.

Q: since what age did you start to notice appetite out of control
%%A: definitely before 30. Whenever I try to control my appetite, I would often find it hard to control.

Psychological inflexibility .. the behavior + the feeling follows one direction, but the control [self2 judge] is steering towards another direction. Conflict and loss of control. These negative consequences are not necessary. Controlled release/surrender can be beneficial.

enviable BMI can come at disproportionate cost
* Older adults often need to fight, on their back heels, an uphill battle to retain muscles. Losing muscle can reduce your BMI but it also affects your metabolism rate
* amputation can reduce your BMI, but do you want that?
