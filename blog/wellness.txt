--no blog: step back. Recognize that I don't really have a power surge for jogging 3 times in a row

i feel guilty for not going there but going has a tcost and an opportunity cost. Am not as efficient as I claim to be when scolding my son.

If I have the power surge I could simply work out in office or at home! 
Limiting factor is not time but absorbency

-- jogging, not yoga, gives me the confidence that I can be avialble for my son for many years.

yoga does improve my long-term wellness.
