Most visible lifestyle factor is each person's diet and BMI profile.

--new : nightly battle
* In Bayonne I never had enticing home-cooked food waiting for me when I reach home. 
* In  SG, these foods are much more enticing than the restrictive foods I had in office !

Wrong time temptation? Partially, since I am not so hungry, but this is different from the textbook case where I was not hungry at all.

wrong qty temptation? partially, since I tend to "finish off everything". This is particular seriosu in the nightly battle.

wrong food temptation? partially. These foods are not as light as the other foods

Sugg: use protein smoothie to combat the temptatioins?
Sugg: fancy fruits to combat the temptation
Sugg: eat something nice before coming home?
sugg: if i know I will have trouble with the wrong-time or wrong-qty temptations, then try to fast before going home.

i need more brushing, perhaps more frequent
I , meimei and boy need more frequent dental checks
meimei need to avoid sweet and also hard food

--no blog: step back. Recognize that I don't really have a power surge for jogging 3 times in a row

i feel guilty for not going there but going has a tcost and an opportunity cost. Am not as efficient as I claim to be when scolding my son.

If I have the power surge I could simply work out in office or at home! 
Limiting factor is not time but absorbency

--fuxi: a covid19 infection in the family would disrrupt everything.
Be prepared psychologically.
I feel SG is one of the better places to get treatment
