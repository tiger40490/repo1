for a few years (2018-2019) I valued wellness higher relative to FOMO, livelihood, benchmarks, fiancial security, wealth ...
Now in mid 2020, wellness is again taking a backseat. 

How do I change my perception and belief to get wellness /restored to its rightful place/? I may need to consciously downplay the other preoccupations.

Q: after a yoga/pull-up/diet/bmi improvemenet, how do I derive the same positive feeling (like pride) as derived from an investment success or job offer?

-- assess the wrong-time temptation each evening. If dangerous, decisively go out to
* playground
* bus interchange
* it could be better to go to a eating place and buy a meal. Zero wrong-quantity temptation! Testimony to my self-knowledge.

Compare two homes for sale. AA is 2 minute away from a jogging track (park, stadium .. not roadside), while BB is 10-minute away, perhaps due to a traffic junction.

( I have lived in BB locations many times in my life. )

Most people believe that particular difference is not worth SGD 10k, but now I'm considering 200k, due to the effort required to overcome the "inertia hurdle". If it's easier, however slightly, to work out then many motivated individuals (like me) would work out more.

real eg: As I observed and declared in my 30's, I only need to persuade myself to reach the stadium gate. I don't need to set a (daunting) goal of x minutes of workout. Once I reach the stadium, the chance of me working out for at least 10 mintues is above 99%. The big effort required is really on the "going" not the workout.

related eg: teeth brushing -- when I had two toothbrushes PREpared with tooth paste on them, then my frequency of tooth brushing increased 50-100%.

Therefore, as I age I have more appreciation of the inertia hurdle. This hurdle is human nature, affecting everyone including the "stronger" individuals among us. If you really prioritize exercise as a lifestyle, and you value the amount of "quality" time you spend therein, then be prepared to pay a real amount to live close to a jogging track.

..In terms of long-term motivation and lifestyle improvement, this is more effecive than experiencing a death in the family. The latter can help you overcome inertia for a few months at best.

.. some people consider it overdependency on external resources.
Well, even though some resilient people are strong enough to need no help, most resilient people tend to rely on external help as revealed in WhyFactor.

So in reality, this dependency can be life-enhancing. 

Similarly, seeking help from Cinga counsellors doesn't automatically make me an incompetent parent.
