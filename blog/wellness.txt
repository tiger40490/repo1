--review of Riverwalk Tandoor buffet
:) no starch. Actually the dishes are rather salty in hindsight but rice won't help much.
:) no alcohol
:) didn't take the very sweet ball
:) chia seeds
:) some raw veg esp. carrot + some fruits at the end
:) didn't take lots of chicken since it's nothing special
:) took more veg since they are special

--fuxi: cooked child veg dish that don't need any starch (not too salty) is good. 

no need to reheat

--fuxi:
Without maid, let's consider buying pre-washed leafy salad. More available in the U.S. 
In SG context... still Cheaper than maid and will boost my self-esteem.

ERE author said "The amount we spend reflects the extent of failure in our skills and imagination"

However, in wellness I beg to differ. I would take yoga classes and go for 3M dental cleaning because I know (and accept) my failure/limitation in terms of daily flossing. 

--fuxi: fruit juice is more convenient than whole fruits but is inferior because
* many bad ingredients are hidden. 
* juice go bad as fast as half-eaten fruits
* less fiber, less filling
* many fruit flavored drinks are nothing but a regular sugary drink with a bit of fruit flavor additive. Nothing to do with juice at all.

--fuxi: slowly get into the habit of eating/buying small packet of nuts

--fuxi: sitting in Manila airport gate 9 waiting room, I slowly managed to achieve lotus pose that I never thought possible.

(similarly, the raw leafy salad I ate on 3k762 was something I never thought possible.)

Seat was not as deep as a regular sofa. 
Lotus is one of my weakest poses all my life.

I deserve a lot of credit. 

Hardly noticed but tough improvement

--fuxi: advice from two BGC yoga instructors on my lower-back fwd bend.
* D/dog should prioritize lower back rather than hamstring, and therefore favor knee-bend
* standard fwd-bend can also include knee-bend to provide better focus on lower-back.

Since tight hamstring often interfere with lower-back stretching, each time we need to prioritize between them. Lower back is clearly more important than hamstring.

--fuxi: On the bgc trip, I decided and wrote down that "yoga is more important than remote work"
Yoga requires more absorbency than jogging, QQ, etc

--fuxi: today at the 2 meals with the group, I practiced bao3shan1 tactics, effectively

The milkshake, though expensive, made me feel full, and in-control, self-respected (even superior)

--fuxi: diet insight{BGC experience #valuable
In a slightly-low-cost location, I can allow myself to eat healthy-but-expensive, healthy-but-unappealing,,,.

Q: what healthy food would I eat more often in SG?
A: pre-washed veg salad, packaged cut fruits, protein smoothie

--fuxi: once my stomach is stretched due to a few big meals, it tends to send stronger hunger signal earlier than before.
My mom said this many years ago.

--fuxi
! eating lots of fruits + veg even when not hungry didn't add to my weight. I believe in the calorie numbers.

I feel starch, fat and perhaps protein do add to my weight.

Fish? Not sure

milk? not sure

--fuxi: Saumik advice:
Saumik said twist and backbend would help straighten the spine and fix the scoliosis.
Doctor said sitting posture and yoga would help.
Without a conscious effort, aging could worsen it? Doctor said should not.
x-ray shows a very mild scoliosis, not reportable.

stretch should be enjoyable, not painful.
Postures are important but Modifications are often necessary.
I feel his modifications are not effective for me. 
I would go with my own modifications.

fish pose with block support below the hip and head.

two blocks ... should not be stacked.

--fuxi:
To satisfy my craving for chocolates, I can eat more raw veg!

--fuxi: Q: why buy mixed veg rice when I have free home cooking?
A: there are many veg (+meat) missing in my home cooking
A: qty-temptation in home cooking. Outside food is rationed
When I reach home late and the leftover is boxed up, I feel no obligation to "finish that tiny amount". 

--fuxi: Many question whether I need to lose more weight. Time will tell. I believe over 20 years they will realize I was right to focus so much on deep-green zone

--fuxi: fresh foods are inferior
Fresh means expensive-yet-unsatisfying
fresh means perishable, can't store for weeks like other foods
fresh means higher risk of "wrong amount"

--fuxi: the pizzahut experience
I couldn't stick to my rule "no food if not hungry". I decided to break my rule but I fought a Baoshan war :

* chia seeds ... added to mushroom soup 
* cabbage + onion ... added to pizza
* I ordered the veg soup instead of mushroom soup

Every small decision counts. I feel proud of myself.

--fuxi: for stable cholesterol level, one test per year is good enough. 
Remember to include full blood count

--fuxi: nutrient timing is invented for ultra-endurance athletes. The reserach findings are not directly applicable to the ordinary people.

--fuxi when it comes to calorie counting, One of the least noticed math features is
various degrees of "bad" when we decide to loosen up and eat bad food
I feel creamy cakes are among the worst, but for most people, it is probably impractical to completely avoid creamy foods as if they were opium. Various degree of bad -- fried peanut and alcohol are both worse than creamy.. tobacco is worst than alcohol and drugs are worse than tobacco. 

In the mass media, we can see the different attitudes towards different categories of "bad" foods

More stupid are the calorie-dense foods that aren't satisfying -- fried peanuts; alcohol; mint ice-cream; cheese chunks; 

--fuxi: yoga or jogging [1] can interfere with my xx/codingDrill, boy's math, work laser ...

[1] swimming is more time consuming.

mini-exercise is less interference

--fuxi: wellness review on bizclass flight
* salad very healthy, without dressing. I at the more salad today than any day over last 6M
* three servings of fruits
* rice I didn't eat up, better than before
* some stretching
* plenty of water
* moderate red wine for heart health
* restraint on cakes, chocolate, ice cream etc, not as unconstrained as before 
* before the flight, I did eat lots of fruits + radish

--fuxi: luxury, medically unnecessary -- these commercial offerings are effective for some athletes or patients, but not clinically proven to be nearly as effective as medicines
* skincare products
* hair treatments
* most MLM supplements
* meal timing
