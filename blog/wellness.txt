--fuxi: once my stomach is stretched due to a few big meals, it tends to send stronger hunger signal earlier than before.
My mom said this many years ago. She could be right, and based on experience.

Now I have got used to big meals in 2020, I don't remember why I was able to live happily with half the food.
