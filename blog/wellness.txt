For each highly attractive food (creamy cakes, flavored nuts,,,) I will record up to 3 scores
* published calorie density vs my own estimate thereof, on my own digestive system, in my own body
* the food's value as a taste-enhancer to help me take in more raw veg.

nuts are the prime example of its type -- high published density but lower density in my estimate, and high value as a companion for raw veg. For higher enhancer score, I should take only garlic flavored nuts without coating.

left-over starch in a delicious starchy food is an important case. For example, Red-bean bun or pizza,,,. 
I often use these foods to help me take in more raw veg. 
After I eat up the most tasty part, there's the left-over, usually starchy. I always feel a semi-conscious urge to finish the left-over but .. but the satisfaction+reward vs calorie "load" simply don't make sense!
 
.. minor scores:
* harms and benefits. Few foods have known side effects -- tobacco, trans-fat, alcohol, 

Before I blacklist a highly attractive food, I better decide really how bad it is.

No more than 4 different scores as I would tend to forget.

--new: increase tolerance for raw veg #deeper-green
The higher my tolerance for raw veg, without any taste-enhancer, the better my chance of long-term health. 
The higher my tolerance for home yoga practice without any help, the better my chance of long-term health

A higher tolerance is a deeper-green zone.

Caution -- if i can tolerate the extreme form of diet and celebrate it too explicitly, then I develop a negative perception of the less extreme yet worthwhile diets like fruits

Eg: raw celery and carrot without any dressing
Eg: Sat morning yoga on hard surface .. is extreme, and when I decide to go realYoga studio I felt like a weakling
Eg: no movie for a year .. is extreme. When I decide to use movie as a reward I hear a zsms

--new: cooked child veg dish that don't need any starch (not too salty) is good. 

no need to reheat

Can freeze.

--new: slowly get into the habit of eating/buying small packet of nuts. This is based on an honest assessment of my limited self-restraint
