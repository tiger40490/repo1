-- new exercise: frq^duration^intensity
This bpost is "trying" to be more focused, less forgetable esp. in its title.

The BBC [[Lazy guide to exercise]] asked "What's the minimum amount of exercise to keep us healthy?" The program primarily looks at the maintenance of three target systems i.e. cardio-respiratory and muscle "upkeep"

~~ weight as resistance .. to shorten the duration
* with squat, chin-up etc (mostly against body weight), even the slowest workout has a real intensity.
* With boxing and jogging, slow means low intensity. Speed would easily triple the intensity.

~~ intensity (vs duration)
Short but intense bursts do count.
short but light activities (like slow walk, housework) do count.
By walking faster, you do "score" more points.
If you have a few seconds of dash to catch a train (if safe), it too help you score more points. 

Most people can't hit 150 minutes/week (30m x 5) of moderate workout. For them, short but intense workouts can be more achieveable.

~~ frequency.. In my theory, sustainable_frequency is probably more important than intensity or duration. To hit the necessary frequency, I could build up the calorie amount incrementally throughout the day, or I could try a short burst like 15 flights of stairs. 

Workout frequency really boosts my self-esteem but can be unsustainable. It requires perception of reality, self-acceptance, fine-tuning/adjustments (tough).

when it's hard to hit 5/wk,
* be flexible with shorter workouts. Start early during the day. incremental build-up .. For boxing, chin-up, squat and stairs, we can incrementally build up an active day.
* accept that it could feel like a chore

~~ duration .. 30-minute sessions are a well-known criteria for "effective workout", including reasonable amount of rests + cool-down. So how much rest is reasonable? It actually varies greatly:

in swimming pool .. many swimmers rest 80% of the time. 60% is kinda average.
in the exercise corners downstairs .. many people rest 90% of the time. 70% is kinda average.
A class .. more disciplines than exercise corners.. instructor is the pacer.. typically 15-30%
my jog .. below 5%.

I prefer [10<-20] minutes of slow jog as my criteria. https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=23343&action=edit lists some workouts that are equivalent to 10-min slow jog (about 1.5 - 2km). There are actually two yardsticks of "equivalence". I'm using "absorbency", not "cardio/calorie". Depending on the context, in each item below the upper limit in a range like  [...-30] usually means "30 counts would match 10 min jog in terms of calorie/cardio".  Notably Jogging has high cardio effect and requires the lowest absorbency as explained in star_rating of power-surges, so using something like skip-rope to match such a high cardio effect requires too much absorbency , too much to be impractical. I would rather set a lower target than setting my regime on a march to hell.

-- update
I attended UrbanDen yoga class with 20 other students, the first big class in a year.
Some of the students near my mat were, like deja vu, so flexible as to put me to shame. 
Sinking feeling. 

If you have been working out on CRE, strength, etc but neglected flexibility, you will hit a sinking feeling .. left behind.

Suppose you go to a developing country where everyone you see is slim, mobile, able-bodied, and flexible, you may hit a sinking feeling .. in the grand scheme of things, how valuable is your net worth?
Concrete example -- YY.Tao has an enviable net worth, but complained about his knee condition. As we age, such conditions are less likely to improve and recover.

Quality of life.

-- update which bpost
BMI can come at disproportionate cost
* Older adults fight to keep muscle. Losing muscle can reduce your BMI but it also affects your metabolism rate
* amputation can reduce your BMI
* Losing your healthy appetite, and becoming someone like grandpa in his late 80s, can reduce your BMI
* During my covid infection, I lost appetite and BMI, but it is not worth it.

-- update (not new!)
sexual gratification (actually, longer active sex life) is sometimes more important to me than improving BMI to 64 kg

BMI helps my CRE and chin-up, but those things are far less important than deep-green.

64 kg may come at a price in terms of muscle loss, but am not convinced.

BMI is more important than early sleep, but early sleep probably helps my diet.

-- limitations of calorie theory:
meal replacement powders

chia and other resistant starch .. can make me feel full for a while. Some lose the satiety effect soon :( Some actuall make me gain weight. So the calorie theory is inconssitent, confusing,,,

nuts .. very high cal density ... too high to believe

juices or whole milk is supposed to provide lots of calories, but I don't feel full 

-- new or fuxi: yoga, core workout: injury prevention/protection
--new: control over BMI ... or update post on passive acceptance
Rahul was very determined and in-control, but he might be slightly overweight.

Many of my colleagues are overweight. I tend to assume they have poor control over diet or exercise, but I could be very wrong. 

Some slim individuals are not really better at self-control. I guess they are just lucky.

This "control" is central to successZ, but if our "system" is hard to control, then I think we need harmony. See the bpost on serenity

-- update one of the bposts on smoothie

Gula syrup is more efficient but more expensive than condensed milk

Need to improve efficiency with chia, wash-up, ice(!)

-- new: itchy sleep
* 40-degree wash/tumble-dry bedsheets and pajamas
* vacuum matteress reguarly

-- update or new:
future blood tests: include full blood count and blood sugar check
