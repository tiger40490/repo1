if i eat dinner when not hungry, I can get very hungry in the morning, even though dinner calorie content was very high.

This confirms my observation that calorie-induced hunger is mostly about timing

--update blogpost on overeat
clean, simple tofu is safe to overeat -- low starcch, low fat, some protein, high water content

if you are serious about visible fat, then avoid meat coated with flour. More than half the times I find skin or fat concealed by the coating.

--update blogpost on wrong-time temptation
"wrong time" is such a prevalent problem in SG (U.S. is costlier and less convenient). It is a problem even at food court, but the $$cost requires me to choose only one meal. The cost makes me slow down and think.

With home meal there's no speed bump! So we have to exercise self-constraint which is tough for most of us.

--fuxi: new strategy against the starchy foods from grandma
eat lots of veg + fruits + milkshake
