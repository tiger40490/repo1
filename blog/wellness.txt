--new: pay to live close2jogg`track #effort hurdle
Compare two residential properties. AA is 1 minute away from a jogging track (park, stadium .. not roadside), while BB is 5 minute away.

( I have lived in BB locations many times in my life. )

Most people believe that the difference is not worth SGD 10k, but now I'm considering 200k, due to the effort required to overcome the "inertia hurdle". If it's easier, however slightly, to work out, then many people would work out more. 

real eg: As I observed and declared in my 30's, I only need to persuade myself to reach the stadium gate. I don't need to set a (daunting) goal of x minutes of workout. Once I reach the stadium gate, the chance of me working out for at least 10 mintues is above 99%. The big effort required is really on the "going" not the jogging.

real eg: teeth brushing -- when I had two toothbrushes PREpared with tooth paste on them, then the frequency of tooth brushing was 50-100% higher.

As I age, I have more appreciation of the inertia hurdle. This hurdle is human nature, affecting everyone including the "stronger" individuals. If you prioritize exercise as a lifestyle, and you value the amount of "quality" time you get to spend on exercise, then pay to live close to a jogging track.
