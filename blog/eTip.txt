-- new: google calendar/gmail as logbook
Background: I have a well-tested and reasonably reliable habit of using google calendar for reminders , often containing valuable details.

Q: is it safe to rely on google calendarfor permanent/immutable logbook, similar to how I used gmail?

A: it's not strictly immutable, without version control.... but still a useful system to meet the basic needs.

Gmail is less "mutable" :), can save more details :) Good complement to google calendar

-- new: too many items: create folders
Usage sites: smartphone/PC desktop icons; browser bookmarks; recoll

The folder is usually opaque (except smartphone). I often fail to recall which folder hosts a particula item. 

Sugg: folder name had better be suggestive.

Sugg: try symlinks/shortcuts. Two copies of the same shortcut can go into two folders.

WindowsApps folder -- not worth optimizing. Quite risky.

--new starhub-TV: unwanted purchase content
New remote doesn't have a button to do the purchase. It's all on-screen.

The only way to prevent accidental purchase is parental control. 4-digit password.

$16 to replace.

Can wrap it in tape, so as to attach a big toy.
