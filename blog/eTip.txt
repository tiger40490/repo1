-- new: ChnM billing++
话费 .. your account balance. Usable to pay Y18 monthly subscription, outging minutes or GB [i.e. mobile data]

Each month, rmb 18 is deducted from acct balance, without pro-ration. Around 2 July, the Y18 deduction will fail.

This specific plan [套餐] has no bundled GB or bundled minutes, so these costs are known as 套餐外xxx

PAYU [pay-as-you-use] .. rmb 3 is "auto-deducted" (from your account balance) to buy 1GB as needed. Similarly, rmb 0.19 is deducted to buy each minute of outgooing air time.

Itemized bill .. available in the app or at end of month in final bill.

ZLH account: starting balance rmb42. rmb18 deducted...
TB account: starting balance rmb28 + top-up rmb10 by grandma = rmb38. rmb18 deducted, then about rmb5 of cumulative airtime. rmb6 for 2GB.

github.com was, as of 7 Jun, accessible from hotel but blocked by ChM, according to ChM hotline. On 19 Jun, I was able to git push via ChM hotspot, so the firewall is kinda dynamic.

~~For my rmb18 package [套餐]
19c/min call-out. call-in is FOC
10c/SMS out. SMS-in is FOC

mobile data is complicated. Basically up to rmb3/GB.

-- new: too many items: create folders
Usage sites: smartphone/PC desktop icons; browser bookmarks; recoll

The folder is usually opaque (except smartphone). I often fail to recall which folder hosts a particula item. 

Sugg: folder name had better be suggestive.

Sugg: try symlinks/shortcuts. Two copies of the same shortcut can go into two folders.

according to Starhub, a new router can last 1-2 Y before degredation. That's why they give a new router every 2Y

Shall we ask starhub?

--new starhub-TV: unwanted purchase content
New remote doesn't have a button to do the purchase. It's all on-screen.

The only way to prevent accidental purchase is parental control. 4-digit password.
