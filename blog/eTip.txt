J4 using 3 laptops concurrently at home
* keep every laptop actively maintained and monitored, so they don't come out of "warehouse" damaged by disuse
* build some "mileage" with L399
* get used to no-touchscreen. Will help me assess the value of touchscreen when I next buy a laptop

-- update VPN
https://www.thechinaguide.com/blog/how-to-use-your-cell-phone-while-traveling-in-china has recommendations

Experts recommend that you NEVER use a free VPN.  Maintaining a VPN that works in China implies a significant financial expense, and therefore you should ask where the VPN is getting this money from.

One recommendation is that you should carefully examine any VPN of this type before installing it, as in many cases, it will install other things, such as programs that display ads while you are browsing, programs that store your browsing data to sell it to third parties or programs that use your computer as a server (your laptop and your Internet connection will work much more slowly). Plus, in the worst case, they are simply viruses or malware.

-- new: .rtf files as alternative to .docx 
In my note system in office or home, and esp. in blogg, I have used RTF to avoid DOCX files.

RTF files are much smaller than DOCX, but can preserve text effects.

-- new: PLN 
I have learnt from experience that PLD devices need ventilation and periodic power-down. I think they become hot quite easily.
My current pair of devices are identical :) and therefore interchangeable. 
One of them is easy to power-off, and gets more "rest". 
So I devised a plan to rotate them, so each one periodically rotates to the light-duty position. 
This rotation scheme may not prolong service life, but can reduce heat in my home.

I find PLN more reliable than wifi, as reliable as ethernet. If that's true, then for some homes PLN is a superior solution in terms of complexity, wiring,,,, See https://tedium.co/2020/06/02/powerline-networking-history/

Whenever I need uninterrupted connectivity for telecommute, I avoid home wifi (including mesh)... too unstable. If I can't run a long cable across rooms, then PLN is my default choice.

-- new: too many items: create folders
Usage sites: smartphone/PC desktop icons; browser bookmarks; recoll

The folder is usually opaque (except smartphone). I often fail to recall which folder hosts a particula item. 

Sugg: folder name had better be suggestive.

Sugg: try symlinks/shortcuts. Two copies of the same shortcut can go into two folders.

according to Starhub, a new router can last 1-2 Y before degredation. That's why they give a new router every 2Y

Shall we ask starhub?

--new starhub-TV: unwanted purchase content
New remote doesn't have a button to do the purchase. It's all on-screen.

The only way to prevent accidental purchase is parental control. 4-digit password.
