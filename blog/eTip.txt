-- new: PLN 
I have learnt from experience that PLD devices need ventilation and periodic power-down. I think they become hot quite easily.
My current pair of devices are identical :) and therefore interchangeable. 
One of them is easy to power-off, and gets more "rest". 
So I devised a plan to rotate them, so each one periodically rotates to the light-duty position. 
This rotation scheme may not prolong service life, but can reduce heat in my home.

I find PLN more reliable than wifi, as reliable as ethernet. If that's true, then for some homes PLN is a superior solution in terms of complexity, wiring,,,, See https://tedium.co/2020/06/02/powerline-networking-history/

Whenever I need uninterrupted connectivity for telecommute, I avoid home wifi (including mesh)... too unstable. If I can't run a long cable across rooms, then PLN is my default choice.

-- new: too many items: create folders
Usage sites: smartphone/PC desktop icons; browser bookmarks; recoll

The folder is usually opaque (except smartphone). I often fail to recall which folder hosts a particula item. 

Sugg: folder name had better be suggestive.

Sugg: try symlinks/shortcuts. Two copies of the same shortcut can go into two folders.

according to Starhub, a new router can last 1-2 Y before degredation. That's why they give a new router every 2Y

Shall we ask starhub?

--new starhub-TV: unwanted purchase content
New remote doesn't have a button to do the purchase. It's all on-screen.

The only way to prevent accidental purchase is parental control. 4-digit password.
