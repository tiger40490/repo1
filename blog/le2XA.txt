My dad's wisdom "尽你所能/尽职尽责" I will translate to "as best you can". 

Avoid mistakes, avoid negative attitudes, avoid offending manager (inadvertently). If best effort is not enough for a given role, it's probably a "role mismatch" as Macquarie boss said. Then it's employer's problem to deal with. If for any reason, they choose termination, then they should try to "compensate", though there's no official obligation. 

From a Buddhist perspective, I guess this wisdom means 平静淡定, not holding too tight. 船到桥头自然直.
