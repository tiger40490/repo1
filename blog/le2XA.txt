My dad's wisdom "尽你所能/尽职尽责" I will translate to "as best you can". 

Avoid mistakes, avoid negative attitudes, avoid offending manager (inadvertently). If best effort is not enough for a given role, it's probably a "role mismatch" as Macquarie boss said. Then it's employer's problem to deal with. If for any reason, they choose termination, then they should try to "compensate", though there's no official obligation. 

From a Buddhist perspective, I guess this wisdom means 平静淡定, not holding too tight. 船到桥头自然直. 

My local manager 老印 (or my senior manager in NY, American) have not complained about my slowness. Even if they do, it's still less alarming, less scary than getting an "error-prone" reputation. 

So far, my 老印 manager only raised concern across the team that most of us in Asia are not stepping up for Production support.

A quality reputation for a SWE is hard to earn and maintain, but easy to lose. One of my colleagues (Indian national, 2Y in the team) has yet to make any mistake known to me, but is slightly low profile and quiet. Does he have a quality reputation? Not quite yet, perhaps becuase he has not make many large-scale system changes to demonstrate his quality mindset. 

Combining Sense of urgency and 细水长流. My son has some sense of urgency but not enough by my stanard. At work, I do feel a sense of urgency but probably not enough by manager's standard. 细水长流 is a sustainable pace of work for the older SWE. I don't feel anyone is embracing it. 细水长流 means steady progress, not zero-progress or sluggish progress.
