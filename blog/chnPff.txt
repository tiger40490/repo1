====== new: learn alipay + wcpay GUIs
For many essentials in China, you would need these two infrastructure accounts. Most shops can't accept credit card or ATM card, and nothing but alipay/wcpay. Some shops accept cash but don't have enough small change.

I believe mobile is the primary GUI (browser? Nah), so you need to invest sufficient time to master the basics, but not at this stressful juggling time

I think Alipay is more foreigner-friendly. There is a brower interface with minimal functionality.

Alipay and wcpay (Similar to PayPal) can transfer to/from bank card. However, transfer-out can incur a 0.1% fee for wcpay/Alipay

For Alipay/wcpay, each mobileNum is dedicated to one account only.
Externally, each Alipay account is identified by a mobileNum. No sharing of mobileNum between two accounts

Alipay, wcpay, Meituan, Hello .. these platforms all have a PPD (prepaid deposit) account in addition to bank card bindings. Each platform has a deduction rule governing which account to hit first.

Boy is able to use ZLH passport + my HSBC card .. Apparently, for foreigners Alipay beats wcpay.

To see only PPD in/out amounts, 
option 1) choose one of the ppd spends then look for 账户余额 then click in
option 2) go to ppd page
