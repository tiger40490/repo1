====== new: learn alipay + wcpay GUIs
For many essentials in China, you would need these two infrastructure accounts. Most shops can't accept credit card or ATM card, and nothing but alipay/wcpay. Some shops accept cash but don't have enough small change due to low usage.

I believe mobile is the primary GUI (browser? Nah), so you need to invest sufficient time to master the basics, but not at this stressful juggling time

I think Alipay is more foreigner-friendly. There is a brower interface with minimal functionality.

Alipay and wcpay (Similar to PayPal) can transfer to/from bank card. However, transfer-out can incur a 0.1% fee for wcpay/Alipay

For Alipay/wcpay, each mobileNum is reserved for one account only.
Externally, each Alipay account is identified by a mobileNum. No sharing of mobileNum between two accounts

Alipay, wcpay, Meituan .. these platforms all have a PPD (prepaid deposit) account in addition to bank card bindings. Each platform has a deduction rule governing which account to hit first.

-- alipay
My Alipay is set up with real name (+bank card) + 17813257725. 
mobileNum is proven easy to change. 

Boy is able to use ZLH passport + my HSBC card .. Apparently, for foreigners Alipay beats wcpay.

Billing page shows all in/out amounts, but can't filter in PPD 

Pay into Meituan acccount? Not supported.

Deduction rule .. Alipay has clear documentation page.

支付管家 .. a more comprehensive sub-app 

Payment code [付款密码]: 6-digit

-- wcpay
todo --> Need to change to 9xxxx16 

My wcpay is set up with Real Name. 
ICBC card (real name) added. I was able to transfer-in.
HSBC visa card added

====== new: ##Chn bank accts
/webank/ ^ /mobank/ 

Common cost (avoided now): ChM monthly fees (rather low) + roaming fees
Common cost: ADBFB
Common cost: cross-bank ATM.. LGlp small amount
Common tcost: revive a dormant/de-activated account or ATM card
Common tcost: replace expired passport.. Need to bring old + new passports to a branch. If you don't update, then you will face difficulty when you bring an unrecognized passport to branches.

We need to Accept the endless t$costs. Here are the justifications for having these accounts.
J4: e-payment 
J4: use ATM to avoid large physical amount
J4: transfer thousands from grandparents.

Common non-trivial operations: 
operation: check balance, cash-out
operation: deposit at ATM or transfer-in. [Transfer-out requires SMS OTP sent to a real-name phone number :( ]
operation: update mobile num
operation: update password/PIN

Compared to Cambodia, Philippines, China banks are better .. easy2visit; 24H hotline; efficient

Need to transfer/log-in once a while and save the passwords.

==== ICBC
todo ----> add icbc card into Meituan [under LSQ's name]

Each bank card is linked to only one savings account (+ optional TD account). The account number is "internal" and invisible to users. Users only need the card number.

How much balance to keep? If not in China, then keep it low like below rmb 1k. If in China, then can keep rmb 5000. Very low balance is risky because grandma may not be available to transfer to me (mobank)

Better give my icbc card# to both grandma/grandpa for reference.

Mon-Sat only .. same hours.

跨行 ATM: RMB2 fee per withdrawal of up to rmb2k

atm card is rarely used as 16-digit debit card. Better use it on alipay + wechat

! signature is all-cap

Even if someone has my card#, mobile#, passport# she still needs password to steal my money.

Online transfer in+out aggregate limit: 10k/D 50k/M 200k/Y

-- replacing ...
To avoid "dormant", need some 主动[active] transaction (like outgoing) every 6 months. To re-activate atm card, visit branch with passport

active transactions can be
* Grandparents can withdraw some amount at ICBC atm. 
* I can use app to transfer out to other IDBC accounts (need sms-otp if adding new payed; need sms-otp if big quantum). 
* I can use ATM to transfer out to other ICBC accounts
* alipay/wcpay

! If you lose your atm card, you can open a new card account, and close the lost card account (7D)

To update mobile num, visit branch with passport, bank card and new phone.

-- e-banking
mobank auth can use 1) 5-dot or 2) phoneNum/se8. No SMS-opt needed

Transfer-out PIN can be similar to ATM PIN.

app can show address, passport#, mobileNum (saved in the app even after the SIM card is replaced)
==== HSBC
ADBFB? Global assessment .. Some day I need to downgrade Sgp account, but China account will incur FB fee of RMB 300/M. Sugg: maintain rmb500k or consider SGD 15k/M deposit.

telephone banking auth.. can use 1) phone banking 219477 PIN 2) ATM PIN 3) SMS OTP

foreign ccy deposit/withdrawal is FOC but large withdrawal needs advance notice.

ATM pin changed to 17xxxx. FOC at any UnionPay ATM.

Can convert from RMB to USD, via app. FX rate is updated every minute.

-- e-banking
Webank auth can use 1) username/password (Txxx2) or 2) username/QR (mobilePIN needed). Using password on a new browser needs SMS-OTP.

Mobank auth needs .. mobilePIN (17xxx), sometimes password, seldom needs SMS OTP.

To reset mobilePIN, go to ForgotMyPin. Need password + SMS OTP... Not easy, so beter don't change too often, and practice often

! PhoneNum .. not needed during logon

Online fund transfer from HSBC -> ICBC is FOC if under RMB 1000k
