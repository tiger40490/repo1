-- new: learn alipay + WechatPay GUIs, but not at this stressful juggling time
For many things in China, you would need these essential accounts. 

I believe the mobile apps are the primary GUIs, so you need to invest time to master the basics. 

I think Alipay is more foreigner friendly. There is a brower interface with minimal functionality.

==== new: ##Chn bank accts
Common cost: ADBFB
Common cost: cross-bank ATM.. LGlp small amount
Common tcost: revive a dormant/de-activated account or ATM card
Common tcost: replace expired passport.. Need to bring old + new passports to a branch. If you don't update, then you will face difficulty when you bring an unrecognized passport to branches.

Given the costs, here are the justifications for openig accounts.
J4: e-payment 
J4: use ATM to avoid large physical amount

Common non-trivial operations: 
operation: check balance, cash-out
operation: deposit at ATM or transfer-in. [Transfer-out requires SMS OTP sent to a real-name phone number :( ]

Compared to Cambodia, Philippines, China banks are better .. easy2visit; 24H hotline; efficient

-- ICBC
Each bank card is linked to only one bank account. The account number is "internal" and invisible to users. Users only know the card number.

ADB rmb300: waived on first ATM card

To avoid "dormant", need some in/out every 6 months. Grandparents can withdraw then deposit some amount at ICBC atm. Or I can transfer in some amount. Transfer-out need sms-otp.
To re-activate atm card, visit branch with passport

To update mobile num, visit branch with passport, bank card and new phone. No paper doc needed.

-- HSBC
ADBFB? Global assessment need to downgrade Sgp account, but China account will incur FB fee of RMB 300/M. Better close it.
