--fuxi: if he reduces his gaming minutes to 30/day but increase his online chat time?

Improvement!

--new:
ask boy (and wife) what things dad can do with boy each week, partly to replace the screen time.
It could be a memorable routine.

I may have a bigger role to play in reducing his screen addiction

--new
lock away the iphone8 until we figure out a way to control its usage. Meanwhile, boy can play games on mom's phone. Mom can also motivate him better.

For school time, the phone will get a SIM card, but we will need to have control policy. By default, no phone.

--new: phone dependency: my criteria
I don't care about other people's definitin of addiction ...
I feel if he spends more than 2H/day looking at the phone screen, it's addiction.

Q: what evidence would convince me that my son is ready to carry a phone
A: when I see that he didn't care about it when it's given to him.

-- new: smartphone can be acceptable for boy #OPL
Pearleen Ong on 19 Oct suggested that smartphone is widely considered a semi-necessity, so it's probably not necessary to delay the handover

I said some S1 students do not have a smartphone. She said these students may feel left out, perhaps due to poverty.

.. at some age, boy may save up and buy a smartphone himself. This is more likely to happen if there's insufficient agreement among the 3 of us.
The open communications channel is priceless. I feel it's built on trust.

.. after 12 Nov don't say yes/no.
give him iPhone8, under mom supervision. agreement. execution
.. holiday
s1 literature subject textbook... story books
CDAC activities
.. 1 Jan let him carry the phone with tracker
try for 2 weeks

find some tracker apps.

--fuxi: Handphone is not a nutrition. Perhaps most of his classmates will soon have a phone, but I bet some will NOT. Even if he is the only one without a phone, it's not the same as being the only student without a calculator.

Smart phone is the opium among many Singapore youth at his age. Alternatively, some may describe it as a pandora's box.
