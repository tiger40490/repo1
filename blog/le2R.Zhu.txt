-- coding as recreation
I told you about energy sinks. (I have blogged about this topic, but I can't reference my blog.) One of my top 3 energy sinks is recreational reading/blogging. You asked a tricky question "If I have some leisure time, how do I choose between recreational reading and rereational coding?"

Despite your best effort, I think this question is still vague as it depends on many factors, such as mood, motivation, 

When I have an automation task in office (or at home), I would spend hours researching, tweaknig my scripts... rewarding and satisfying.
If I have not done recreational coding for many months, I would feel more motivated.
Before/after a coding interview, perhaps for a friend, or as an interviewer, I would feel more motivated.
When learning some unfamiliar language feature, I would be keen to write some code to investigate, explore. 
When I have only small windows of spare time, reading/blogging is convenient.

Some people write games in their spare time. I don't enjoy anything gaming.
Some people write GUI in their spare time. I don't enjoy GUI coding including mobile or web apps. In my 20s and 30s I did enjoy web application dev.
