-- 5/5/2024 we covered many topics. I spoke for 80% of the time (too much)
family medical history .. You are lucky with relatively few family history issues (beside 直肠 cancer). I hope you get to live a long healthy life. Despite my CAD, I hope to live beyond 90.

risks to over-achievers .. beside "health" and "family", I will mention a few -- burn-out, regrets, disillusionment. My dad is the achievement type, a writer and social science researcher till his early 80s. (Some peers remain active in their late 80s.) I can see my dad gradually slowed down his pace since his 70s, mostly due to health. I think he never neglected his health or family, but his "achiever" personality does have downsides .. (as he lamented) relatively few hobbies and recreations, relatively few friends for emotional support.

I'm sure there are successful leaders who left a real legacy and lived a healthy life. These individuals are a rare species. Lee Kuan Yew is a familiar example to me. Warren Buffett is another example. Notably, their individual lives have been critically examined by both critics and rivals. There was no major disgrace, though every human has weaknesses and blunders.

I have become more keen, even attracted (not "worried") to learn about cancer, diabetes, dementia and other chronic health conditions. (My older family members had cancers, open-heart surgeries, heart attacks ..) I think it is a healthy dose of fear and motivation. Many of these conditions are a risk to my family and friends alike.

My "early detection" motivation has revealed (borderline?) conditions, or early signs of gastritis, white-blood-cell, pre-diabetes, fatty liver, prostate etc. Some of them are what I call "benign" but still something to monitor as I age.

ED -- I use the sildenafil pill by itself, or in combination with an adjustable ED-ring. The ring is highly recommended, even though occasionally ineffective when I rely on it to maintain erection for "entrance". 

-- coding as recreation
I told you about energy sinks. (I have blogged about this topic, but I can't reference my blog.) One of my top 3 energy sinks is recreational reading/blogging. You asked a tricky question "If I have some leisure time, how do I choose between recreational reading and rereational coding?"

Despite your best effort, I think this question is still vague as it depends on many factors, such as mood, motivation, 

When I have an automation task in office (or at home), I would spend hours researching, tweaknig my scripts... rewarding and satisfying.
If I have not done recreational coding for many months, I would feel more motivated.
Before/after a coding interview, perhaps for a friend, or as an interviewer, I would feel more motivated.
When learning some unfamiliar language feature, I would be keen to write some code to investigate, explore. 
When I have only small windows of spare time, reading/blogging is convenient.

Some people write games in their spare time. I don't enjoy anything gaming.
Some people write GUI in their spare time. I don't enjoy GUI coding including mobile or web apps. In my 20s and 30s I did enjoy web application dev.
