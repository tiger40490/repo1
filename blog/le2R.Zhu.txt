-- ED is the technical term for the difficulty we discussed.

I think I had growing difficulties over decades, and stablized during covid, then in 2023 suffered a steep decline. As I described to you, I received a huge blow to my self-confidence and self-esteem ... "Knocked out". I felt hopeless like falling off a cliff into a yawning abyss. 

The harder I tried, and the more I wanted to "regain", the tougher it gets. I think Performance Anxiety is the description. 

Even when I could "get in", I often failed to last very long. Known as "PE", this condition affects the level of fulfilment, but doesn't affect self-confidence, so not a primary concern to me.

I decided to seek urologist help. Many things didn't work, but the pill worked. As I told you, I remind myself that aging may require high dosage, which may lead to side effects. The regular pill may then stop working. 

( I also worried about drug resistance, but my urologist said unlikely. )

(Related to some Buddhist teaching) I remind myself to enjoy what I have now. I thank God for the level of fulfillment. Cross the bridge when I come to it, not to worry about it too early. 

-- coding as recreation
I told you about energy sinks. (I have blogged about this topic, but I can't reference my blog.) One of my top 3 energy sinks is recreational reading/blogging. You asked a tricky question "If I have some leisure time, how do I choose between recreational reading and rereational coding?"

Despite your best effort, I think this question is still vague as it depends on many factors, such as mood, motivation, 

When I have an automation task in office (or at home), I would spend hours researching, tweaknig my scripts... rewarding and satisfying.
If I have not done recreational coding for many months, I would feel more motivated.
Before/after a coding interview, perhaps for a friend, or as an interviewer, I would feel more motivated.
When learning some unfamiliar language feature, I would be keen to write some code to investigate, explore. 
When I have only small windows of spare time, reading/blogging is convenient.

Some people write games in their spare time. I don't enjoy anything gaming.
Some people write GUI in their spare time. I don't enjoy GUI coding including mobile or web apps. In my 20s and 30s I did enjoy web application dev.
