-- ED is the technical term for the difficulty we discussed in January 2024, when I was visiting New York.

I think I had growing difficulties over decades, and stablized during covid, which was an "unexpected success". Then in 2023 I suffered an unexpected steep decline. As I described over phone, I got a huge blow to my self-confidence and self-esteem ... "Knocked out". I felt hopeless, like falling off a cliff into a yawning abyss. 

The harder I tried, and the more I wanted to "regain" whatever, the tougher it gets. I think Performance Anxiety is one element. 

Even when I could "get in", I often failed to last very long. A few times I felt (still happens in 2023) the gratification and pleasure was so transient and fleeting. Known as "PE", this condition affects the level of fulfillment, but doesn't affect self-confidence, therefore not a primary concern to me.

I decided to seek urologist help. Many things didn't work, but the pill worked. Even now, I often feel the pill is nothing short of a miracle. As I told you, I remind myself that aging may entail high dosage, which may lead to side effects. The regular pill may stop working so miraculously. I think some professional (if not a friend) explained it using cars. As my milage builds, my engine/transmission, my pipes and gears,,,, get worn out and require more and more frequent servicing.

(Related to some Buddhist teaching) I remind myself to enjoy what I have now, however brief. I thank God for the level of fulfillment. Cross the bridge when I come to it, not to worry about it too early. 

I also worried about drug resistance, but my urologist said unlikely.

During my younger years, our frequency was higher, but for the last 5 years (mostly because of her limitations) I feel underfucked. I tell myself to be grateful to my wife. 

Many times I do feel grateful to my wife. Self-talk works. Cognitive therapy.

With aging, people tend to develop 三高 -- high cholesterol, high blood sugar, high blood pressure. These risks are creeping up on me.

In early Apr 2024, I had a chance discovery of CAD (coronary artery disease). My heart arteries have developed multiple plagues (cholesterol deposits), causing up to 50% blockage of blood flow to my heart. No stenting required yet, but I need a lot of medication to control the situation and prevent blood clot or further plaque build-up.

Cause of my CAD is family history + aging, which also affect the risks of diabetes and hypertension.

I have family history of hypertension but (luckily) not diabetes. (My mom had both CAD and hypertension.) My current blood pressue is close to my own target of 130/80. My current Hba1c is 5.9%, slightly below prediabetes level.


-- coding as recreation
I told you about energy sinks. (I have blogged about this topic, but I can't reference my blog.) One of my top 3 energy sinks is recreational reading/blogging. You asked a tricky question "If I have some leisure time, how do I choose between recreational reading and rereational coding?"

Despite your best effort, I think this question is still vague as it depends on many factors, such as mood, motivation, 

When I have an automation task in office (or at home), I would spend hours researching, tweaknig my scripts... rewarding and satisfying.
If I have not done recreational coding for many months, I would feel more motivated.
Before/after a coding interview, perhaps for a friend, or as an interviewer, I would feel more motivated.
When learning some unfamiliar language feature, I would be keen to write some code to investigate, explore. 
When I have only small windows of spare time, reading/blogging is convenient.

Some people write games in their spare time. I don't enjoy anything gaming.
Some people write GUI in their spare time. I don't enjoy GUI coding including mobile or web apps. In my 20s and 30s I did enjoy web application dev.
