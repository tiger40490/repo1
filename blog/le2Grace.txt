17 Dec 2024 I came home for dinner. Yixin rarely eat with family but he did sit down with Mom to eat her cooking. (He told me to wait for him to finish dinner first.) During dinner, he decided to "hug" Mom repeatedly until she became ... miserable -- she was physically unable to eat her food, she begged for him to stop, and she cried with tears. Yixin was teasing (and emotionally torturing) Mom. All of her tears and plea seemed to give him satisfaction. 

I was listening to it in my room. This horrible scene was nothing new to me, so I didn't intervene. Then I shouted to my wife "If you want to show him how you feel, you can flip the dining table with the food on it."

A short while later, Yixin declared that he had no appetite. I sat at the same table to finish the leftover food. Then Yixin's anger started to emerge. He accused me of destroying his appetite. He threatened "You said flip the table and destroy the food. You are not allowed to eat the food." He then came to the dining table, grabbed the food and threatened to dump in the trashbin. Mom stopped him. Then he took the same food to the living room sofa. All the while, I was seated at the dining table, eating fruits, while arguing with Yixin why I had the right to make that suggestion to Mom. 

A few minutes later, I walked to sofa, snatched the food from Yixin and started walking to kitchen. (This turned out to be the trigger.) Sensing his aggression, I told him "I won't eat this food. I will only store it in kitchen." This fell on deaf ears. Yixin quickly followed me and made a serious attempt to touch the food. I knew he wanted to smash the plate holding the food, so I openly challenged him "If you want to flip the plate, then you have to pass me first." Within 2 seconds, he overpowered me and smashed the plate and food on the floor. Shocked, I then witnessed Yixin smashing my laptop (damaged). He then took my office backpack and smashed and kicked it repeatedly, in violent anger.

Mom and sister were speechless. I decided to remain calm to avoid losing my cool. I decided not to intervene physically (ineffective). I said I must call the police. I took a phone and tried to go out of our home, but Yixin stopped me. He then used his full force, again, to prevent me from leaving. Within a few seconds, I managed to escape and called police. Yixin heard it, and he ran away from home.

I met police at home for 2 hours. Police noticed minor bruises on me. I told police I don't plan to pursuit court case (or FGO) against Yixin. I love my son. I want him to get treatment (he has refused for 5 months).
