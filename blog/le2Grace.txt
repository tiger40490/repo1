Correction -- Mom has not mentioned divorce. She only dropped a verbal hint of "family breakup". Perhaps she felt that my action would cast a long shadow over Yixin's adult life for decades, even destroy Yixin's future.

FSC has now become the primary source of support for my wife (Yixin largely refused FSC.) I value and will continue our email counselling. No need for audio. (I won't send too many emails to FSC. They have more urgent matters. I don't want to distract them.) 

Thanks Grace for your kind words. It's tough for you as a counselor, because there is no first-hand interaction with Yixin or Mom. Providing second-hand info to you, I try to be truthful and objective, but the pains in my written words could distort the picture painted. In this mail, I will list some positives.

* Thank God it's over. Yixin now engages in unlimited screentime, without conflicts with parents..(I gave up.) Yixin can get up at any hour he likes without attendance worries.

* Yixin said he did put in a lot of serious effort on the nights before his exams. Not "a lot" by my standard, but I will put aside my standard. Mom and I both praise him for his last-day effort.

* Yixin shared a bit of his academic aspirations with Mom. Miraculously, the O-level ordeal has not killed his academic motivation. More important IMO is self-improvement motivation. He has  shown precious little such motivation, mostly in body-building.

* Since end of exams, at least on some nights, he did tune down his music to let poor Dad sleep. I am grateful. Yixin remains the one and only one to decide when and whether to do that for others... (self-centered). I'm ready to call police, though police only comes in 2 hours.

* Yixin did show some restraint in terms of anger management. Mom, Yixin and I all have some anger management to learn. I try (hard) to be a role model. That's why I call in police rather than engage in tussle with Yixin.

* After 11 pm, Yixin still forces his way into "double-decker bedroom" of Mom and sister. Despite their continuous protests ("I need to sleep."), he still uses his superior physical strength to resist... Unacceptable, but after O-levels, he is in a better mood and he only "tortures" his victims for a SHORT 10 minutes (used to be 20+). I kinda know that he will "release" them soon so I won't call the police. A big improvement in family harmony.

* Yixin's anti-social behavior can be characterized as mucking around, creating distress in family members (most severely poor Mom). I don't see a single trace of bullying or aggressive behavior towards non-family-members.... a polite and sociable teenager.

* Yixin's aunt Genn (my sister) in Sydney has been a long-time advisor to both me and Yixin. (She said "mucking around".) She might have a bit of influence on Yixin given their rapport. She is firm and strong and echoed my commitment to end the mistreatment of females in my home (mostly Mom). I told Genn "Strong dominates the weak" has to stop and Mom must learn to say STOP!

* his sister is probably not so fearful of him .. just a bit fearful (still unacceptable)

* (except with sister) Yixin has never hurt anyone at home. 

* I won't say my son is kind, but he is not really a heartless kid as he appears.

* I won't say my home is overflowing with love as it used to, but there is some tender loving kindness, when Yixin is in normal mood.

* After a 2-month break, we have resumed weekend family outings, though Yixin still refuses to shower (last on 5 October)

* Yixin's long-time teacher has shed some light. For her privacy I can't quote her verbatim -- 

I've actually noticed that Yixin is 'principled' in not such an unusual way; he just doesn't do what he doesn't believe in. He is unwilling to empathise with others or do something for the sake of others if it means compromising what he believes in. A simple example: he refuses to report by the reporting time for the exam because he strongly believes it doesn't matter (and it's proven it doesn't, strengthening his belief) as it doesn't affect his results. Even if his mother kneels and pleads, he will not budge for her sake. Sadly, he is unwilling to give up (even the smallest of) self for others. It’s heartbreaking to hear Mrs Tan’s distress when I call her. 

Once again, drafting, reviewing and sending you these emails has been a relief. When the content is heavy (as in my other emails), writing it felt like giving birth to a sick baby -- I am forced to examine a painful, grotesque part of my life. I am not permitted to reject this part of my life. I have to understand it and deal with it, sooner rather than later.
