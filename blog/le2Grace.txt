Hi Grace,

Nowadays I count a lucky morning, if I get to sleep through a quiet hour during 6~7am. My night sleep starts around 12 and last 8 hours. I frequently get a "rude awakening" due to heated conversations beyond my bedroom door, in the living room. Heated because of no-shower, late to school, hooked-to-phone,,
Yixin has slept on our big sofa for 3W+. He only sleeps in his airconditioned room if he takes a shower, which he last did in late Aug.

Yixin has often refused to change clothes after coming home. He wears his soiled school uniform till the next morning.

Yixin has been late about 5 times in the last 30 days. He gets only 5 hours of sleep at night and struggles to get up. He sometime blames Mom for waking him up late, but I always insist he needs to regulate his own sleep.

Some weekend mornings, Yixin would wake up and start watching his phone for a long time, refusing to wash up, eat, drink water or attend tuition on time.

All of the above drives Mom crazy in the morning. She doesn't always scream or yell, but she does more than nag. She is pissed off and irritated by her son's ODD behavior.

I think Yixin has ODD (oppositional defiant disorder), but I was instructed to avoid labelling my kids as such. Yixin is turning down counselling even though the counsellor is nearby and a nice guy that he liked.

I do what I can to keep whatever little harmony left in the family... 

Perhaps Yixin is subconsciously testing the limit of our unconditional acceptance. It's a game of testing and provocation. As my dad urged me, I refuse to give up on Yixin. I refuse to lose my cool.
