Hi Grace,

Here are some pointers I received from you.

Your personal perspective of FGO is powerful and valuable precisely because they are personal, rather than hearsay. You said (something like) no one in the FGO program loves your child as much as you do. That's profound. I seldom think that way (gender difference?). I do feel and believe that my parents love me more than anyone else on earth. 

I said that I wanted my son to pay a price for inflicting so much distress on his parents.

"Heavy price" -- you said. It might be too heavy a punishment on a 15-year-old. You pointed out Yixin is only 15 and is probably not out to torment his parents. 

Revenge? Perhaps I'm taking revenge on my 15-year-old son when I threaten him with FGO. Bullying?

loss of control -- when I admit I'm unable to control my son, that's one side of the coin. The other side of the coin is an admission that I'm unable to control my emotion in the face of Yixin's challenge.

You pointed out that when parents somehow admit defeat, we could inadvertently strengthen Yixin's power.

To sever the chain reaction of phone-confiscation -> Yixin's adverse-reaction -> parent overpowered/defeated -> loss of control -> FGO, I could, at least in theory, cut the link after "adverse-reaction". Stay cool and calm. Show minimal (or no) fear and frustration. 

I still foresee an "endless cycle" of behavior-improvement, relapse, conflict, adverse-reaction, overpowered,,, but I didn't give enough credit to behavior-improvements. Celebrate every small improvement ... is valid advice.

I appreciate our email counselling, even if you give only brief replies. It provides me an outlet to express, and to be heard.
