Correction -- Mom has not mentioned divorce. She only dropped a verbal hint of "family breakup". I think she meant that my action would cast a long shadow over Yixin's adult life for decades, even destroy Yixin's future.

FSC is now the primary source of support for my wife (Yixin largely refused FSC.) I value and will continue our email counselling.

Thanks for your kind words. It's tough for you as a counselor, because there is no first-hand interaction with Yixin or poor Mom. Providing second-hand info to you, I try to be truthful and objective, but the pains in my writing could distort the picture painted. In this mail, I will list some positives.

* Thank God it's over. Yixin now engages in unlimited screentime, without conflicts with parents..(I gave up.) Yixin can get up at any hour he likes.

* Yixin said he did put in a lot of serious effort on the nights before his exams. Not "a lot" by my standard, but I will brush aside my standard. Mom and I both praise him for his last-day effort.

* At least on some nights, he did turn down his music to let me sleep. I am grateful.

* his sister is probably not so fearful of him (just a bit fearful)

* (except with sister) Yixin has never hurt anyone at home. 

* Yixin did show some restraint in terms of anger management. Mom, Yixin and I all have some anger management to learn. I try (hard) to be a role model. That's why I call in police rather than engage in tussle with Yixin.

* I won't say he is kind, but he is not really heartless.

* I won't say my home is overflowing with love, but there is some tender loving kindness most of the time, when Yixin is in normal mood.

* Yixin's long-time teacher has shed light, though for her privacy I can't quote her verbatim -- 

I've actually noticed that Yixin is 'principled' in not such an unusual way; he just doesn't do what he doesn't believe in. He is unwilling to empathise with others or do something for the sake of others if it means compromising what he believes in. A simple example: he refuses to report by the reporting time for the exam because he strongly believes it doesn't matter (and it's proven it doesn't, strengthening his belief) as it doesn't affect his results. Even if his mother kneels and pleads, he will not budge for her sake. Sadly, he is unwilling to give up (even the smallest of) self for others.

Yixin's recent anti-social behavior can be categorized as mucking around, creating distress in family members (most severely poor Mom). I don't see a single trace of bully or aggressive behavior towards people outside the family.
