Correction -- I never said or meant "violence". Yixin is not violent. More like unauthorized use of physical force. See my mail [[Changes I wish to see in my son]].

Someone asked what changed recently that led to Yixin's bullying/mistreatment of Mom (and sister). Answer: nothing. Same behavior for a long time. Tension boiled over only because I started calling in police. I dared not do so when Yixin was preparing for O-levels. (He would be affected by police, or he would threaten to skip an exam.)

I rememer your fellow OCFA counsellor once introduced the four horsemen -- criticsm / contempt / defensiveness / stonewalling. When I call in police, Yixin sends all four.

Stonewalling -- he would turn cold and refuse to talk to me.

Criticsm -- "No parent would ask Police to take their son." He would accuse me, sometimes in front of Mom. I think he meant I am not a loving parents.

Contempt -- I'm described as a weak parent, by both Yixin and Mom. Well, with my heart condition I'm indeed advised not to engage in wrestles with my son, either to take back Mom's phone, or to reduce his music volume or pull him out of other people's bedroom. How is that related to contempt?

Defensiveness -- Yixin seems to believe he has done nothing wrong. Both Yixin and mom considers my decision to call in police aggressive, destructive, stupid,,, (In a sense, Mom is possibly defensive of Yixin whenever I call police, even if the victim is a herself.)

Key is respect. As a parent I must earn his respect even when I repeatedly call in police. Even a wheelchair-bound parent can earn respect. I want Yixin to know that there's no shame in calling in police, even though it is slow, inefficient (often a waste of their trip).

Further more, my daughter needs to know there is no shame in calling in police. She should be bold to call police, and encourage Mom to break her silence and reach out for help when bullied by her big brother. When she grows up and deals with males, she ought to have confidence in her physical strength and mental strength, and confidence in the System. The Singapore system, I'm proud to say, has a statutes to protect females. Females should never live in fear of males.

I feel that subconsiously, Yixin has more contempt for Mom. I wrote on 10 Nov "I suspect that deep inside, she would rather get injured (during a tussle) than get Yixin investigated." I feel in Yixin's eyes, Mom has no backbone.
