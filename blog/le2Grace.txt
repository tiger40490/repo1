Hi Grace,

We are nearing the end of the O-levels exam period, largely intact as a family. The current pain point is not shower, not physical attacks but.... Yixin's loud music [midnight to 3am], something he needs to accompany his exam cram. There are multiple layers on this "onion", and they touch upon "freedom", (unwilling) sacrifice by parens, sense of fairness, personal responsibility over academic study.

Yixin believes his parents+sister had a duty to adjust our sleep, and show more tolerance, while he adjusts music volume and goes into his room. Give-n-take is my chosen slogan. Little sister needs to get up at 6am; Mom often becomes visibly sleep-deprived.... Yixin knows.

When I (and the police officer who I called in) mention our neighbours' need for a quiet night, Yixin is quite clear that he does NOT expect neighbors to sacrifice. in Oct, one neighbor did come to the door and confront Yixin, and Yixin did reduce volume for her, and Yixin believes she was never affected afterwards.

Police officer asked about earphone. Yixin explained that earphone is uncomfortable. I empathize with my son.

Parents (and teachers) always tell him he needs to adjust his sleep schedule so as to study during day time, and spread out his effort over multiple days (if not weeks) prior to the very eve of an exam. Yixin explained (unapologetically) that he was unable to. I said "In such a case, you have to live with the consequence like failed exam." Yixin said he may have to skip the upcoming exam, because he relies on the final night to make up for lost time.

( His prelim results in Aug were so poor that he refused to show parents. I guess he failed most subjects. That didn't seem to motivate him to study more. I have come to accept my son's study style.) 

Yixin further criticized parents for not sacrificing enough (for his big exam and his future). He said something like "If I fail this and that subject and go to ITE, it's your fault." He refused to take responsibility. I have decided to sleep outside the home on the upcoming eves of exams. (Hopefully he is grateful.)

Both parents (and police officer) feel it is unfair for multiple family members to bend over backwards just to tolerate Yixin's post-midnight music in the name of supporting his exam cram. Granted, Yixin does, at least sometimes, adjust his volume and/or goes into his bedroom, but the result is still less than satisfactory. I know first the volume of music. From Yixin's explanations, I realized he thinks it's unfair for him to sacrifice his freedom and sacrifice his upcoming exams.

Some silver linings 
* Yixin never downright rejects our requests for quiet. He tends to ask "Please give me some time" but without giving any hint of how long.
* Yixin seldom becomes so rude as to say "It's your problem to be light sleepers." He does say his volume is already "very" low.
* Yixin does study. I know some kids refuse to study at all or even skip the exam.
* Yixin did attend all his tuitions, albeit always late. He has a good impression of the last cast of tuition center teachers. He had earlier walked away from other teachers he disliked.
