Hi Grace,

After this letter, I may take a break. I feel growing self-confidence and self-acceptance after our recent discussions.

Many overworked parents (me too) pray for the day when "My kids start working" or the day when "I have saved enough to retire", or the day "We become debt-free".... Liberation! For me, 

* I wish that somewhere down the road, I don't need physical intimacy to feel in love with my wife. So I don't need medical treatments to satisfy my need (or her need).
* I wish that somewhere down the road, one of my parents has a relatively painless or quick passing at the end of their long lives. I hope they don't suffer a lengthy and difficult decline in their final years.
* I wish that somewhere down the road, I have a quick passing from a sudden heart failure, and not go through some dreadful long-term illness (I won't name them) that burden my family.

The idea of "liberation" for me is associated with .. choice. If no choice, then no obligation of due diligence before a big decision, and no obligation of (self-)care. There are many important decisions down the road for myself and family members, not only in career, healthcare, immigration,, Those decisions (and months leading up to them) are the breeding ground of tension, self-doubt, self-hate, regrets, drop in confidence, and (inner)conflicts. Some people are naturally adept in decision-making. Look at the prime ministers. I think they are imperfect individuals and make imprefect decisions all the time, but mentally and physically they are able to cope with the stressors. I'm never such a leader. Those decisions and choices I listed above are burdensome stressors for me. The biggest stressor is taking care of someone for life.

I recently read about a tsunami survivor adopting a pair of orphans he found in the ruins. I also have some American Jewish colleague who adopted a handicapped child. I asked my wife "For such a parent, what's his goal for the child?" I told her my answer "It's not about top schools or branded degrees. It's about survival of the kids and their growth into independent adults." When Steve Jobs's blue-collar parents adopted him, they promised the biological parents to send the boy to colllege. They didn't aim higher than that. 

My kids both have academic difficulties (esp. math) despite help from mom, dad and tutors. I think the will both qualify for Express stream.

I think in theory I can focus on my kids' physical and emotional well-being. As supportive and disciplined, principled parents, I can provide them a safe harbour esp. when they get caught in a storm. (We talked about FGO and youth homes...) On the other hand, my children's academic and subsequent financial achievement is not my job. This is something I learn from those adoptive parents, something I want to share with you (no one else cares.)

You asked what give me comfort, optimism and gratitude.

A: I read about longevity in people with CAD .. usually more severe than mine
A: In Singapore and in the 2020s, I'm better equipped, better educated to fend off diabetes, hypertension, stroke, obesity. These are the typical comorbidities
A: reduced (longevity) targets -> less performance anxiety -> easier to exceed my own expectations -> comfort
A: wife and I are slightly less unequal. (similar to my dad) Am growing more dependent on (and loyal to) my spouse, giving her a sense of security.
