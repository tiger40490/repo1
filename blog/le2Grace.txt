A few points you raised

constant disappointment .. I keep my expectations more realistic and lower (still too high) so I don't really feel Yixin is a Constant disappointment.

self-compassion / kind .. am no perfect parent. Emotions can get out of hands. That's fine. I'm still in control of myself even at the worst time.

considerate and empathetic .. complicated topic. By nature, Yixin is empathetic and considerate. By "force" he has closed his eyes and covered his ears when his parents show pain. Nothing new to me, because I also did something similar to my parents.

Mom/Dad disagreement .. not so bad. I feel we are largely in-sync and usually stand together. The split on "police issue" is the greatest exception to prove the rule. 

Relationship power .. The mom-son bond improved in some way during the cram. After the cram, the father-son bond also started to heal. The "relationship power" you mentioned depends on trust, bond, respect, and communication channel. I always value the communication channel. It was closed off during the darkest hours, largely by Yixin, in response to my attitudes. 

picking battles .. I have unconsciously followed your tip. I avoid battles on hygiene, study hours, sleep schedule, screen time (and content), diet, 

I once described to you my reliance on quiet personal time. In our recent Japan family trip (our first) I decided to carve out plenty of quiet time, partly to cope with the endless disagreements (mild conflicts) with Yixin.
Mom and Yixn enjoyed shopping districts such as Akihabara, Shibuya, Ginza, Shinjuku... so they spent hours and hours there. I spent most of those hours alone in hotel. Even after coming back to Singapore, I felt I need to go away to a quiet place by myself. Some people (including my wife) may feel I wasted my trip to Japan but looking back, I had a better experience than other sight-seeing trips with my family in Korea, Hongkong.... Korea trip was "notable" for the severe shortage of quiet time.

Quiet time raises a parenting question -- How do I get enough quiet time but maintain a presence for my children?

My daughter is reluctant but really needs to practice math. When she does comply, she needs a parent to keep her company.... My presense.

Yixin tends to open up to me once a while, and only when I'm at home. 
When I propose a fireside chat, I really wish he is in a calm, receptive mood. I think it's hard for both of us to be in a calm mood. I often have many commitments in and outside the office + home. I wonder what it is like to head up a department and simultaneously raise 3 kids (like some colleagues). How do such parents juggle and maintain presence?
