Correction -- I never said or meant that Yixin is violent. More like unauthorized use of physical force. See my mail [[Changes I wish to see in my son]] for concrete examples.

Someone asked me what changed recently.
Answer: nothing changed that led to Yixin's bullying/mistreatment of Mom. Same behavior for a long time. Tension boiled over only because I started calling in police. I dared not do so when Yixin was preparing for O-levels. (He would be affected by police, or he would threaten to skip an exam.)

Answer: Yixing's existing anti-social behavior intensified during the O-levels ordeal. For example, he insisted on loud music as "I absolutely need it tonight, to study for tomorrow's exam." 

Answer: The exam cram also emboldened him to stand firm against bathing as if it would affect his mood for study. His erratic study/sleep schedule also made him uninterested in family meals or drinking of plain water (soft drinks exclusively). By the end of this ordeal, parents have developed a strong perception of a stone-cold, irritable/ill-tempered, self-centered, self-isolated, deaf and stubborn teenager.

I rememer your fellow OCFA counsellor once introduced the four horsemen -- criticsm / contempt / defensiveness / stonewalling. When I call in police, Yixin sends all four horsemen to me.

Stonewalling -- he would turn cold and refuse to talk to me.

Criticsm -- "No parent would ask Police to take their son." He would accuse me, sometimes in front of Mom. I think he meant I am not a loving parent, deserving his respect.

Contempt -- I'm described as a weak parent, by both Yixin and Mom. Well, with my heart condition I'm indeed advised not to engage in wrestles with my son, either to take back Mom's phone, or to reduce his music volume or pull him out of other people's bedroom. How is that related to contempt?

Defensiveness -- Yixin seems to believe he has done nothing wrong. Both Yixin and mom considers my decision to call in police aggressive, destructive, stupid,,, (In a sense, Mom is possibly defensive of Yixin whenever I call police, even if the victim is a herself.)

The key to this problem, as I see it, is respect. As a parent I must Earn his respect even when I repeatedly call in police. Even a wheelchair-bound parent can earn respect. I want Yixin to know that there's no shame in calling in police, even though the process is slow and inefficient (often a waste of their trip).

Further more, my daughter needs to know there is no shame in calling in police. She should be bold to call police, and encourage Mom to break her silence and reach out for help when bullied by her big brother. When she grows up and deals with males, she ought to have confidence in her physical strength and mental strength, and confidence in the System. The Singapore system, I'm proud to say, has a statutes to protect females. Females should never live in fear of males.

I feel that subconsiously, Yixin has perhaps more contempt for Mom. In my (and perhaps our children's) eyes, Mom lacks a real backbone. I wrote on 10 Nov "I suspect that deep inside, she would rather get injured (during a tussle) than get Yixin investigated." (Obviously a scratch is different from a head injury.) 

Your concern of home safety is slightly exaggerated. Yixin never touches other people's private parts. He doesn't inflict physical pain (except the "punching" described ealier). Injury is possible during a tussle for a device. Injury risk is higher when he forces his way into someone's personal space, and we pull/push him away, really hard.

You wrote about being considerate and respectful toward others. I think Yixin is about the same as other normal teenagers when he deals with grandparents, aunt and non-family members. But he is direspectful of parents and ignores our feelings. Sometimes he seems to feel wronged by parents and seeking revenge as soon as he grows stornger. Is it becuase we tried for years to control his screen time?
