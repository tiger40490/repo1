Hi Grace,

After this letter, I may take a break. I have more self-confidence and self-acceptance after our recent discussions.

Many overworked parents (me too) pray and wish for that day when "My kids start working" or the day when "I have saved enough to retire", or the day "We become completely debt-free".... Liberation! For me, 

* I wish that somewhere down the road, I don't need physical intimacy to feel in love with my wife. So I don't need medical treatments to satisfy a need.
* I wish that somewhere down the road, my parents have a relatively painless or quick passing at the end of their long lives (80+). I hope they don't suffer a lengthy and difficult decline in their final years.
* I wish that somewhere down the road, I have a quick passing from a heart attack, and not go through some other dreadful long-term illness (I won't name them) that burden my family 

The idea of "liberation" for me is associated with choice. If no choice, then no obligation of due diligence before decision-making, and no obligation of (self-)care. In reality, there are many important decisions down the road for myself and family members, not only in career, healthcare, immigration,, Those decisions are the breeding ground of tension, self-doubt, self-hate, regrets, drop in confidence, (inner)conflicts. Some people are naturally adept in decision-making. Look at the prime minister or the leader of any large organization. I think they are imperfect individuals and make imprefect decisions all the time, but mentally and physically they are able to cope with the stressors. I'm never such a leader, though I'm a co-leader of my tiny family.
