Hi Grace,
Thanks for clarifying your system limitations. I'm a grateful Singaporean, even though I complain ;) 

Yixin's / Mom's Current status: 

* sleep .. 2 - 11 am... slightly better because no need to wake up tired and catch school 
* shower ... he last showered 5 Oct. He will decide when to shower again. He did take up my bold suggestion once -- pour a pail of water and complete a 1-second shower head to toe.  
* tuition .. ended for good. Yixin is on his own. 
* screen time .. I guess he studies 1-2 hour a day, only at night. Entire morning and afternoon on screens. I told Mom this is better than some kids who give up on studies completely.

No physical conflict so far. The biggest change needed is on parent's side. Parents need to accept the reality, let go (of our expectations), mellow up, accept the real, imperfect child as is.

I'm sad to observe that for a few weeks, Yixin has stopped answering any phone call from me. I feel it was a punishment of some minor conflicts in Aug or Sep. He would not confirm. Alternativel, he probably didn't feel a need to answer any phone call from his father, because has has no (or low) respect for me.

He has even less respect for Mom. You can tell from shower, from screen time control, sleep schedule etc. Most telling is his attitude on mom's cooking. Mom always cooks for him but he seldom eats. He doesn't inform mom "Hey Mom, I'm not eating tonight / home lunch." and he never apologizes.

The most serious evidence is his pattern when we agree to meet at a place And Time. For the past 6 months, he would make Mom (sometimes his sister + father) wait for 30 to 60 minutes, 9 out of 10 times.

Frequently, Yixin is emotional, quick-tempered, sometimes intolerant of Mom and Dad, and occasionally aggressive (not in the past week). 

You know what, so am I as the parent. I oscillate between two modes -- 

1) the normal father .. self-constrained adult, tolerant, understanding, sometimes forgiving, always keeping cool
2) the bitter, tough father  .. disappointed, fearful, sometimes angry, even vindictive.

Today I noticed the bitter father in me. (Unconditional acceptance of my son is a holy grail I don't aim to reach.) The punishing instinct in me tends to trigger a dangerous overreaction in Yixin, sometimes explosive, sometimes aggressive.

Hi Grace,

I think Yixin has ODD (oppositional defiant disorder), but I was instructed to avoid labelling my kids as such. Yixin is turning down counselling even though the counsellor is nearby and a nice guy that he liked.

I do what I can to keep whatever little harmony left in the family... 
Perhaps Yixin is testing the limit of our unconditional acceptance. It's a game of testing and provocation. As my dad urged me, I refuse to give up on Yixin. I refuse to lose my cool.
