I rememer your fellow OCFA counsellor once introduced the four horsemen -- criticsm / contempt / defensiveness / stonewalling. When I call in police, Yixin dispatched all four horsemen to me, ranked by horsepower.

Stonewalling -- he would turn cold and refuse to talk to me, or simply walk away when I come close.

Criticsm -- "No parent would ask Police to take their son." He accused me, sometimes in front of Mom. I think he meant I am not a loving parent, deserving his Respect.

Contempt -- I'm described as a weak parent, by both Yixin and Mom. Well, with my heart condition I'm indeed advised not to engage in wrestles with my son, either to take back Mom's phone, or to reduce his music volume or pull him out of other people's bedroom. How is that related to contempt?

Defensiveness -- Yixin seems to believe he has done nothing wrong (with punching, hugging, music, door pounding,,,). Both Yixin and mom considers my decision to call in police aggressive, destructive, stupid, a sign of weakness... (In a sense, Mom is possibly defensive of Yixin whenever I call police, even if the victim is herself + younger sister.)

The key to this problem, as I see it, is respect. As a parent I must EARN his respect even when I repeatedly call in police. I often feel that a wheelchair-bound parent will need police help, and can also earn respect. I want Yixin to know that we feel no shame in calling in police.

Further more, my daughter needs to know there is no shame in calling in police. She should be bold to call police, and encourage Mom to break her silence and reach out for help when bullied by her big brother. When she grows up and deals with males, she ought to have confidence in her physical strength and emotional strength, and confidence in the System. The Singapore system, I'm proud to say, has statutes to protect women. Females should never live in fear of males.

I feel that subconsiously, Yixin has perhaps more contempt for Mom. In my (and perhaps our kids') eyes, Mom lacks a real backbone. I wrote on 10 Nov "I suspect that deep inside, she would rather get injured (during a tussle) than get Yixin investigated." Obviously a scratch is different from a head injury.

-- Someone asked me what changed recently that led to the escalation. 
Answer: nothing changed that led to Yixin's bullying/mistreatment of Mom. Same behavior for a long time. Tension boiled over only because I started calling in police. I dared not do so when Yixin was cramming for O-levels. (He would be affected by police, or he would retaliate and threaten to skip an exam.)

Answer: Yixing's existing anti-social behavior intensified during the O-levels ordeal. For example, he insisted on loud music as "I absolutely need it tonight, to study for tomorrow's exam."

Answer: The exam cram also emboldened him to stand firm against bathing as if it would affect his mood for study. His erratic study/sleep schedule also made him uninterested in family meals or plain drinking water. By the end of this ordeal, parents have developed a strong perception of a stone-cold, irritable/ill-tempered, self-centered, self-isolated, self-sabotaging, deaf and stubborn teenager.
