Hi Grace,

Friday's phone session is my first deep dive into FGO. Below are some pointers I received from you. I will also raise probing questions to myself. Some questions are tricky to address by email, so you are free to leave them to our next chat session.

FGO used to be known as BeyondParentalControl (BPC) order. I find this BPC phrase highly relevant.

Your personal perspective of FGO is powerful and valuable precisely because they are personal. You said (something like) no one in the FGO program loves your child as much as you do. Profound. I seldom think that way (gender difference?). I do feel and believe that my parents love me more than anyone else on earth.  

I said that by choosing FGO, perhaps I'm prioritizing family wellbeing above Yixin's long-term wellbeing. Unfair statement. I'm not pushing Yixin into a fire pit (Chinese idiom). Admittedly, the other three peoples' wellbeing is indeed my top priority. If someone must make _some_ sacrifice, I feel it is my boy. I wish I could stay by his side as he goes through the sacrifice. Singapore NS sounds like a better place then Youth Court. Yixin will not go through a "sacrifice" during NS.

I said that with FGo I wanted my son to pay a price for inflicting this much distress on his parents. "Heavy price" -- you said. You pointed out Yixin is only 15 and is unlikely going out of his way to torment his parents. He chose those retaliation actions 1) out of despair 2) desparately trying to get back his lifeline i.e. the iphone. I recognize that but I can't leave his retaliation unpunished. I feel I must strike back. My wife would say "Let's smash this phone."

Revenge? Perhaps I'm taking revenge on my 15-year-old boy when I threaten him with FGO. Bullying?

Browbeating? (for want of a better English word) Perhaps I have an urge to subdue and tame my son's adverse-reactions. I have a tendency to perceive him as a wild horse to be subdued, though I never apply physical strength.

loss of control -- when I admit I'm unable to control my son, that's one side of the coin. The other side of the coin is an admission that I'm unable to control myself i.e. my own emotions in the face of his challenge.

You pointed out that when parents somehow admit defeat, we could inadvertently strengthen Yixin's power. After we delare we have given up, we often remember the experience as a failure, a defeat, an evidence to show FGO judge that "Look, this is beyond our control."

To sever the chain reaction of phone-confiscation -> Yixin's adverse-reaction -> parent overpowered/defeated -> loss of control -> FGO, I could, at least in theory, cut the link after "adverse-reaction". Stay cool and calm. Show minimal (or no) fear and frustration. 

I still foresee an "endless cycle" of behavior-improvement, relapse, conflict, adverse-reaction, overpowered,,, but I didn't give enough credit to behavior-improvements. Celebrate every small improvement ... is valid advice.

Q: Every parent has numerous frustrating experiences trying to control a teenager, but when do those war stories cross over to become evidence of BPC? What's the criteria?

Yixin's adverse-reactions are seldom physical. Even if physical, they are seldom strong enough to pose a threat to our safety and wellbeing. Instead, there is usually an emotional over-reaction in one of the parents, before things descend into failure/defeat/BPC. So perhaps my claim of BPC (Look this is beyond parent's control.) boils down to 70% Yixin + 30% parents?

I appreciate our email counselling, even if you give only brief replies. Email counselling provides me an outlet to express myself, and to be heard.
