Hi Grace,

I think Yixin has ODD (oppositional defiant disorder), but I was instructed to avoid labelling my kids as such. Yixin is turning down counselling even though the counsellor is nearby and a nice guy that he liked.

I do what I can to keep whatever little harmony left in the family... 
Perhaps Yixin is testing the limit of our unconditional acceptance. It's a game of testing and provocation. As my dad urged me, I refuse to give up on Yixin. I refuse to lose my cool.
