Your concern of home safety is understood but let me clarify. Yixin never touches people's private parts. He doesn't inflict physical pain (except the "punching"). Injury is possible during a tussle for a device. Injury risk is higher After he forces his way into someone's personal space, and when we pull/push him away, with full force.

Another clarification -- I never said "violence". More like unauthorized use of his strength. See my mail [[Changes I wish to see in my son]] for specific behaviors. Negative consequences for these behaviors are so far tricky.
* calling in police .. can have a chance to change Yixin's behavior only if we have evidence. I have unsuccessfully requested police to install CCTV.
* counselling .. Yixin can decline/suspend counselling. He has too much power.
* kick him out out of home .. My sister (Yixin's aunt) suggested it, but Yixin is too young and he might join street gangs, as he threatened.
* I once threatened to withdraw myself from (fully paid) family vacation, but everyone in my extended family objected. 
* I could threaten to veto the next planned vacation "if you do this to mom/sister again" ... very tricky. He could blackmail me "Unfair/unreasonable. I will run away, join gangs,,," or substance abuse.

As of now, there is no real consequence. As the authority at home, my hands are tied.

You wrote about being considerate and respectful toward others. I think Yixin is just like the average teenager when he deals with grandparents, aunt and non-family members. But he is direspectful of parents and ignores our feelings. (His sister is also disrespectful of parents, and so are many youngsters.) Sometimes he seems to feel wronged by parents and seeking revenge as soon as he grows stornger. (Is it becuase we tried for years to control his screen time?) Some example:
* shower
* refuse to eat Mom's cooking, without prior warning
* make others wait for him on the street, while he takes his time at home eating, watching (youtube), playing (games), chatting (friends) before he leaves home.

A lot of my descriptors of Yixin also describe his younger sister to some extent (and therefore describe many families with youngesters) -- disrespect, self-centered, lack of empathy, ignoring parents, ill-tempered, no-consequence, shouting-back,,, Is Yixin's behavior on the extreme end? Perhaps, not sure. 

Indignation (and outrage) is a natural reaction in these situations, but it is unhelpful and possibly harmful. As an imperfect father, I will allow myself to feel indignation, but I will work on reducing it. What I'm driving at is not exactly unconditional love for my son, but more like self-love. Indignation probably hurts my coronary arteries, when I need to mellow up and stay calm.

Someone asked "Does your son love you?" I think he is scared of losing me due to divorce, or heart attack, or forced seperations. I can focus on that and build conversations on it.

-- I rememer your fellow OCFA counsellor once introduced the four horsemen -- criticsm / contempt / defensiveness / stonewalling. When I call in police, Yixin dispatched all four horsemen to me, ranked by horsepower.

Stonewalling -- he would turn cold and refuse to talk to me, or simply walk away when I come close.

Criticsm -- "No parent would ask Police to take their son." He accused me, sometimes in front of Mom. I think he meant I am not a loving parent, deserving his Respect.

Contempt -- I'm described as a weak parent, by both Yixin and Mom. Well, with my heart condition I'm indeed advised not to engage in wrestles with my son, either to take back Mom's phone, or to reduce his music volume or pull him out of other people's bedroom. How is that related to contempt?

Defensiveness -- Yixin seems to believe he has done nothing wrong (with punching, hugging, music, door pounding,,,). Both Yixin and mom considers my decision to call in police aggressive, destructive, stupid, a sign of weakness... (In a sense, Mom is possibly defensive of Yixin whenever I call police, even if the victim is herself + younger sister.)

The key to this problem, as I see it, is respect. As a parent I must EARN his respect even when I repeatedly call in police. I often feel that a wheelchair-bound parent will need police help, and can also earn respect. I want Yixin to know that we feel no shame in calling in police.

Further more, my daughter needs to know there is no shame in calling in police. She should be bold to call police, and encourage Mom to break her silence and reach out for help when bullied by her big brother. When she grows up and deals with males, she ought to have confidence in her physical strength and emotional strength, and confidence in the System. The Singapore system, I'm proud to say, has statutes to protect women. Females should never live in fear of males.

I feel that subconsiously, Yixin has perhaps more contempt for Mom. In my (and perhaps our kids') eyes, Mom lacks a real backbone. I wrote on 10 Nov "I suspect that deep inside, she would rather get injured (during a tussle) than get Yixin investigated." Obviously a scratch is different from a head injury.


-- Someone asked me what changed recently that led to the escalation. 
Answer: nothing changed that led to Yixin's bullying/mistreatment of Mom. Same behavior for a long time. Tension boiled over only because I started calling in police. I dared not do so when Yixin was cramming for O-levels. (He would be affected by police, or he would retaliate and threaten to skip an exam.)

Answer: Yixing's existing anti-social behavior intensified during the O-levels ordeal. For example, he insisted on loud music as "I absolutely need it tonight, to study for tomorrow's exam."

Answer: The exam cram also emboldened him to stand firm against bathing as if it would affect his mood for study. His erratic study/sleep schedule also made him uninterested in family meals or plain drinking water. By the end of this ordeal, parents have developed a strong perception of a stone-cold, irritable/ill-tempered, self-centered, self-isolated, self-sabotaging, deaf and stubborn teenager.
