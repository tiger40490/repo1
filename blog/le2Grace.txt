Hi Grace, Thanks for your detailed feedback and pointers. (I always appreciate specific items.) I will selectively touch on some of them.

You are spot-on when you wrote "You had these expectations of him and he did not meet those expectations. But you recognize and accept that he is not you, and perhaps his expectations of himself are not as high as your expectations of him. It sounds like when you were growing up, you felt "not good enough" and pushed yourself hard to be better. You do not see the same drive in Yixin so that is disappointing to you"

My expectations of Yixin were initially harsh and have reduced many times. I recently watched the new Singapore movie "I not stupid 3". I was reminded of the huge gap between Yixin and those P5 boys in terms of academic effort. "Drive, determination, perseverance, resilience" were some of the words used by Yixin's teachers in P5/P6/S1/S2/S3/S4. I think these words were used in the pursuit of benchmark exams. Nowadays I hate these words when I look at my son's attitude towards exams and school work. As I wrote the last sentence, I felt nothing but pain (disappointing as you said), so I had to stop writing for a while.

Okay I'm back. The China boy in the movie was motivated by fear, just as I was -- fear of failure and regret. He was caught between a rock and a hard place and somehow found a superhuman strength to survive. I vaguely remember that some of my high-school classmates (in hyper-competitive 1980s China) had health issues due to school stress. For the same reason, my elder sister was unable to study in the final weeks before the big exam "gaokao". Nevertheless, most of the China students I know survived like I did, and grew apparently very strong through those immensely grueling years. That sets my expectations of my kids on the one hand, but on the other hand, I try to follow the "adoptive parents".

Yixin's school issues have not improved much, such as late attendance, grades, HBL (Home-Based-Learning). 

Showering .. Mum's complaints and frustrations have remained, every day, though my tolerance has improved. I sometimes step in, apply my "sniff test" and announce my "independent test" result, presumably helpful (in reducing tension between them).  I also remind Yixin not to promise a specific timing (because it sets up dangerous expectations...)

Late to school .. Yixin has 13 demerit points in Sec4, mostly due to late attendance. If he is late for 4 more times this year, his 21 demerit points would affect his poly admission. Yixin was late more than 20 times in Sec3 so teachers warned us repeatedly. Yixin knows Sec4 demerit points are serious.  Yixin also knows "If I miss this particular bus at this time, then likely to arrive late." 

To avoid the morning struggle (stressful for Mum too), we all tell (nag) him to sleep early. Fruitless. For a few months, he managed to sleep by 23.30 (always gets up 6.30) but has regressed to 12am+. When I ask him to set a target time to put down his phone and go to bed, he often says (we speak Mandarin) "I hear you." or "Don't need to ask me." At that junction, I follow the "adoptive parent" style. He is likely to score more demerit points and may exceed the "red line" and face consequences in poly admission. Still,  We can't force an elephant to drink.

(A minor improvement -- I now pay more attention to cardiologist's advice and avoid late-night fireside chats with Yixin. I try to sleep around 12 am, for my heart health. My wife also supports it.)

As you said, Yixin is assertive in his self-management... comparable to my "assertive" attempts with my manager(s). With some past managers, I didn't care so much about the consequences (on my job), so I was more assertive.  Similarly, when Yixin goes to the army, his assertive/rebellious acts would have consequences on his team and himself, and he would surely adjust. (Street-smart boy.)

You asked, "How did you manage to do this". I am generally a survivor in my 10+ jobs and schools. (In schools, I usually do more than "survive"... am naturally good at academic study.) I adjust myself, find my strengths, work hard on (or protect) my weaknesses, and cope with my innate limitations. (I don't like vague answers like this :) I think my son is also adaptive, but not a naturally good student. 

I was not able to remain a student forever and had to adjust to the world after university. In contrast, Yixin had better postpone his university study. I think he would adjust better (than I did) to commercial work environments.

Key to my "survivor" strategy is the SWOT analysis -- strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats. I have mentioned Yixin's S/W/O. I constantly watch out for Threats [hazards, risks] -- substance addiction, screen addiction, truancy, bad friends, self-rejection/self-hate. I hope Yixin gets into a better polytechnic course, so his classmates are more likely to be motivated youths.
