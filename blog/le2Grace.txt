Hi Grace,

FGO used to be known as Beyond Parental Control (BPC) order. I find this "BPC" highly relevant. I read it as "parental control proven inadequate".

Friday's (27 Oct) phone session is my first deep dive into FGO/BPC. Below are some pointers I received from you. I will also raise questions to myself. Some questions are tricky to address by email, so you are free to leave them to our next chat session.

Your personal perspective of FGO is powerful and valuable precisely because they are personal. You said (something like) no one in the FGO program loves your child as much as you do. Profound. I seldom think that way (gender difference?).

I told you that by choosing FGO, perhaps I'm prioritizing family wellbeing above Yixin's long-term wellbeing... Unfair perception. I'm not pushing Yixin into a fire pit (Chinese idiom). Admittedly, the other three peoples' wellbeing is indeed my top priority. If someone must make _some_ sacrifice, I feel it is my dear boy, but he is not a sacrificial lamb. I wish I could stay by his side as he goes through the FGO sacrifice. In comparison, Singapore NS sounds like a better place. 

I told you that with FGO I wanted my son to pay a price for inflicting this much pain on his parents. That's a subconscious motivation. "Heavy price" -- you said. You pointed out Yixin is only 15 and is unlikely to be bending over backward to torment his parents. He chose those retaliation actions desperately and impulsively trying to get back his lifeline i.e. the phone. I recognize it, but I can't leave his retaliation unpunished. I feel I must strike back. His mom would say "Let's smash this cursed phone."

Revenge? Am I taking revenge on my 15-year-old boy when I threaten him with FGO. Bullying? Perhaps I have an urge to tame my son's adverse-reactions. I have a tendency to perceive him as a wild horse to be subdued, though I never use physical strength. I'm proud of my self-constraint.

When a teacher loses her temper over a rebellious student, she can turn to a published penalty code. Similarly, between Yixin and me we have been working on a contract governing his screen time, sleep schedule and the consequences of breach. I still find myself sometimes losing my cool but the contract, in black and white, can serve as a tranquilizer and arbitration, can help contain overflow of emotion, and restrain impulsive FFF reactions. 

Loss of control over my son -- when I admit I'm unable to control my son, that's one side of the coin. The other side is an admission that I'm unable to control my emotions in the face of his challenge.

Here's a less dangerous example. At least 4 times a month for the last two years, Yixin's mom has setbacks/frustrations over his failure to take shower after he comes home sweaty and smelly. Imagine you have a teenage son who refused to take shower before midnight. Imagine that he says he would take shower before sleep, but breaks the promise half the time. How realistic is it to control your emotion?

You pointed out that when parents somehow admit defeat, we could inadvertently strengthen Yixin's power. Days after we declare we have given up, we often remember the experience as a failure, a defeat, an evidence of BPC to show the yourth court that "Look, this is beyond parents' control."

To sever the chain reaction of 

  "phone-confiscation -> Yixin's adverse-reaction -> parent overpowered/defeated -> BPC -> FGO",

.. I could, in theory, cut the link after "adverse-reaction". Stay cool and calm. Show minimal fear and frustration. Take it in my stride like how I handle my ED issue, or how I handle a hopeless performance review, an unfair/unbearable management decision, or an investment loss.

Q: Every parent has frustrating experiences trying to "tame" a teenager, but when do those war stories cross over to become evidence of BPC? What's the criteria?

In the youth court, perhaps the responsibility of BPC will be attributed 70% to Yixin + 30% to parents? 

Yixin's adverse-reactions are more often verbal than physical. Even if physical, they are seldom strong enough to pose a serious threat to safety. Yixin's adverse-reactions are not necessary-n-sufficient conditions for BPC. Instead, there is usually an emotional over-reaction in a parent, before he/she feels overpowered/failure/defeat/BPC. In terms of fff, mom and dad do enter fight mode. Flight mode is engaged when the parent leaves home or I ask Yixin to hurry up and go somewhere. It is interesting to note that Yixin doesn't show any fff except fight-mode occasionally. Now I feel flight is better than fight. I don't want to run away whenever Yixin resists parental control. I will try confiscation-then-flight.
Here is my new directive for each "challenge"

* Yixin deliberately planning to be late for school, late for tuition, late to counselling session .. Accept it
* refuse to attend school, tuition, counselling ... internet access block, then flight
* full-day screen-time before an exam .. Accept it, because study is his own responsibility.
* yelling, pushing, snatching .. confiscation , then flight

I still foresee an "endless cycle" of behavior-improvement, relapse, conflict, adverse-reaction, overpowered,,, but I didn't give enough credit to behavior-improvements. Celebrate every small improvement ... is valid advice.

7 Nov I spoke to a police post staff. I feel grateful to hear a helpful tip -- seek "official" government agencies (IMH-CGC, FSC, FGO...) help to build up proper record. Again, I trust the government agencies to keep fair, unbiased records. They will help parents seek professional intervention from government. 

Email counselling provides me an outlet to express myself, and to be heard, even if you give only brief replies.
