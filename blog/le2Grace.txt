Mom has not mentioned divorce. She only dropped a verbal hint of "family breakup".

Thanks for your kind words. It's tough for you as a counselor, because there is no first-hand interaction with Yixin or poor Mom (my wife). Providing second-hand info to you, I try to be truthful and objective, but the pains in my writing could distort the picture painted. In this mail, I will list some positives.

* Thank God it's over. Yixin now engages in unlimited screentime, without conflicts with parents. (I gave up.) Yixin can get up at any hour he likes.

* Yixin said he did put in a lot of serious effort on the nights before his exams. Not "a lot" by my standard, but I will brush aside my standard. Mom and I both praise him for his last-day effort.

* At least on some nights, he did turn down his music to let me sleep. I am grateful.

* his sister is probably not so fearful of him (just a bit fearful)

* (except with sister) Yixin has never hurt anyone at home. 

* Yixin did show some restraint in terms of anger management. Mom, Yixin and I all have some anger management to learn. I try (hard) to be a role model. That's why I call in police rather than engage in tussle with Yixin.

* I won't say he is kind, but he is not really heartless.

* I won't say my home is overflowing with love, but there is some tender loving kindness most of the time, when Yixin is in normal mood.

I guess that as early as lower secondary school, Yixin has been observed to attack Mom and sister by pushing them off balance. Outside Toa Payoh MRT, I saw him pushing Mom really rough from behind. She nearly fell. He did it in anger.

Yixin's recent anti-social behavior can be categorized as mucking around, creating distress in family members (most severely for poor Mom). I don't see a single trace of bully or aggressive behavior towards people outside the family.
