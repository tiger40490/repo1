Hi Grace,

Many overworked parents (me too) pray for the day when "All my kids start working" or the day when "I have saved enough to retire".... Liberation!   As for me, 

* I wish that somewhere down the road, I don't need physical intimacy to feel in love with my wife. So I don't need medical intervention to satisfy my need (or her need).
* I wish that I can accept a very low-paying job (less than half my current, or even lower), but stable, meaning job
* I wish that somewhere down the road, one of my parents has a painless, quick passing at the end of their long lives. I hope they don't suffer a lengthy and difficult decline in their final years.
* I wish that somewhere down the road, I have a quick passing from a sudden heart failure, and not go through some dreadful long-term illness (I won't name them) that burden my family.

The idea of "liberation" for me is associated with .. choice/decision. If no choice, then no obligation of due diligence before a big decision, and no obligation of (self-)care. 

There are many decisions down the road for myself and loved ones, not only in career, schooling, healthcare, immigration,,, Those decisions and months leading up to them are the breeding ground of tension, self-doubt, self-hate, regrets, (inner)conflicts, and drop in confidence. 

Some people are naturally adept in decision-making. (Look at the prime ministers.) I think they are imperfect individuals and make imprefect decisions all the time, but mentally and physically they are able to cope with the stressors. I'm never such a leader. Those decisions and choices I down the road are burdensome stressors for me. Arguably the biggest stressor is taking care of someone for life, such as aging parents, my wife, kids, and possibly my elder sister.

I recently read about a tsunami survivor adopting a pair of orphans he discovered in the ruins. I also have some American Jewish colleague who adopted a handicapped child some 20+ years ago. I asked my wife "If you are this parent, what's your goal for the child?" I told her my answer -- It's not about top schools or branded degrees. It's about survival of the kids, growing into independent adults. When Steve Jobs's blue-collar parents adopted him, they promised the biological mother to send the boy to college. They didn't target higher than that. 

My kids both have a bit of academic difficulties (esp. math) despite help from mom, dad and tutors. I think both will qualify for Express stream.

Learning from the adoptive parents, I think in theory I can focus more on my kids' physical and emotional well-being. As disciplined and principled parents, I will provide them a safe harbour esp. when they get caught in a storm. (We talked about FGO homes...) On the other hand, my children's academic and subsequent professional careers are Not my job. Today is a case in point: 

Yixin is preparing (but not cramming) for O-levels. June school holiday has started, but he has no daily routine, no study plan. We will rely on tuition center. The Sec4 system seems to rely on student self-motivation, self-discipline. Insufficient in Yixin, so parents step in to remind him (nagging). I often feel he is currently throwing away the opportunity, by putting in limited effort, but I remind myself 

* Yixin is more autonomous than PLSE season 4 years ago. He is more aware of the consequences. He didn't throw away PLSE (T-score exceeded our expectations.)
* Many 15-yo boys don't put in full effort in Sec4. The adoptive parent would accept that, not because they love this son any less than a biological son. (We gave up on JuniorCollege long ago) If Yixin enrolls into a polytechnic of his second choice, we would accept, just as a caring adoptive parent would.
* Some of my friends/classmates in their teenage years gave up their phones and "cram" for the last year, and score well, but they are NOT the majority. 
* As (adoptive or biological) parents, I remind him, monitor him, try to "motivate" (tough) and support him, but I can't control him.

You asked what specific things give me comfort, optimism and gratitude in the face of CAD.

A: personal stories .. I read about longevity in people with CAD. Like them, I hope to live past 90 in reasonable health, and protect my children.
A: confidence in the system .. Living in Singapore and in the 2020s, I'm better equipped, better educated, better supported to fend off diabetes, hypertension, stroke and obesity.... the comorbidities of CAD.
A: comparison with cancer .. I have CAD but (Thank God) no cancer. I won't need dreadful, repeated treatments. If I can fend of those comorbidities like diabetes and stroke, then I may live a long life and have a quick passing (described earlier).
A: a realization .. reduced longevity targets -> less performance anxiety -> easier to exceed my own expectations -> comfort
A: a realization .. wife and I are slightly less unequal. (similar to my dad) Am growing more dependent on (and loyal to) my spouse, giving her a sense of security.
