A few points you raised

constant disappointment .. I keep my expectations more realistic and lower (still too high) so I don't really feel Yixin is a Constant disappointment.

self-compassion / kind .. am no perfect parent. Emotions can get out of hands. That's fine. I'm still in control of myself even at the worst time.

considerate and empathetic .. complicated topic. By nature, Yixin is empathetic and considerate. By "force" he has closed his eyes and covered his ears when his parents show pain. Nothing new to me, because I also did something similar to my parents.

Relationship power .. The mom-son bond improved in some way during the cram. After the cram, the father-son bond also started to heal. The "relationship power" you mentioned depends on trust, bond, respect, and communication channel. I always value the communication channel. It was closed off during the darkest hours, largely by Yixin, in response to my attitudes. 

Mom/Dad disagreement .. not so bad. I feel we are largely in-sync and usually stand together. The split on "police issue" is the greatest exception to prove the rule. 

picking battles .. I have unconsciously followed your tip. I avoid many battles on personal hygiene, study hours, sleep schedule, screen time (and content), diet, music volume,,, My observant daughter has also been reminding me (boiling like a volcano) "Don't say anything when Yixin shows up." I complied. Those tense moments passed peacefully. In the rear mirror they look like ... irrations. 

I once described to you my reliance on quiet personal time. In our recent Japan family trip I decided to carve out plenty of quiet time, to get adequate rest, and to cope with the countless quarrels with Yixin .. verbal wrestles, even conflicts, to be described later. (There were other disagreements in the family but not as bad.)
Mom and Yixn enjoyed shopping districts such as Akihabara, Shibuya, Ginza, Shinjuku... so they spent hours and hours there. I spent those hours alone in hotel. Even after coming back to Singapore, I felt I need to go away to a quiet place by myself. I did find quiet on MRT, and footcourt. Some people (including my wife) may say that I wasted my trip to Japan, but looking back I had a better experience in Japan than other sight-seeing family trips to Korea, Hongkong etc. Korea trip was "notable" for the severe shortage of quiet time. I only realized the "shortage" when I sat down to reflect by writing.

Quiet time raises a parenting question -- How do I get enough quiet time but maintain a presence for my children?

My daughter is reluctant but needs to practice math. When she does comply, she needs a parent to keep her company.

Yixin tends to open up to me once a while, and only when I'm at home. 
When I propose a fireside chat, I really wish he is in a calm, receptive mood. I think it's hard for both of us to be in a calm mood. I often have many commitments in and outside the office + home. I wonder what it is like to head up a department and simultaneously raise 3 kids (like some colleagues). How do such parents juggle and maintain presence?
