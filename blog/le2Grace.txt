Hi Grace,

CPS has met with my family, drafted a safety plan and started planning how to engage Yixin. That's a positive change. 

Today over wechat call I told my sister Genn, Yixin's aunt, about Yixin's smashing outbursts. She challenged me about discipline, consequences, parental authority and power struggle at home. I defended my practice briefly, then I forwarded her our 30 Sep 2024 email exchange.

I think in our imperfect world, we easily find many bullies who faced no real consequences, at least none in their lifetime, for their aggression on the weak (forget Ukraine).
* corrupt officials demand/receive millions, live and die rich, shielded by their power network.
* Even in the most advanced, efficient market economy, a big player often abuses its power and position to crush small competitors. We read lawsuits in the news but rarely any consequence.
* powerful men demand/receive sexual favors, often without consequence. The wife often turns a blind eye. The family appear to be standing together.
* Sexual crime victims are often silenced by shame, "family honor" and legal obstacles, esp. if the perpetrator is a powerful bully. I rememer the Jodie Forster movie [[The Accused]] https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-accused-1988
* To a lesser extent, many adults emotionally abuse elderly parents, or bully them financially, but face no consequence.

So, I accept the reality that without proper consequences for his violence, Yixin is possibly growing more powerful, as he smashes his way to apparent "dominance". I still believe in what I wrote on 30 Sep 2024:

I don't think we are condoning him... He sees that his parents are in pain and trying to cope with the pain. He knows his ODD (opp defiance disorder) behavior is causing disharmony and unhappiness in the family. He doesn't prefer this atmosphere. (What he prefers is.....  perhaps more freedom... I don't know). This uncomfortable atmosphere is a consequence of his and parents' actions.

I will read your recent replies later, but now, a few past pointers from you
* pick your battle
* adoptive parenting .. I now give my son more freedom about sleep, screentime, hygiene, personal wellness (while reminding him of self-care). I worry less about his professional future
* reflective parenting .. my emails constitute my attempts to get into Yixin's mind. I have faith in these best efforts that they will help me see forgive him, see him (less as a monster) more as a human, 
* set boundary at home .. I did say "Never hurt your young sister esp. when you are in a rage."
