Hi Grace,

FGO used to be known as BeyondParentalControl (BPC) order. I find this "BPC" highly relevant.

Friday's phone session is my first deep dive into FGO/BPC. Below are some pointers I received from you. I will also raise probing questions to myself. Some questions are tricky to address by email, so you are free to leave them to our next chat session.

Your personal perspective of FGO is powerful and valuable precisely because they are personal. You said (something like) no one in the FGO program loves your child as much as you do. Profound. I seldom think that way (gender difference?). 

I told you that by choosing FGO, perhaps I'm prioritizing family wellbeing above Yixin's long-term wellbeing. Unfair characterization. I'm not pushing Yixin into a fire pit (Chinese idiom). Admittedly, the other three peoples' wellbeing is indeed my top priority. If someone must make _some_ sacrifice, I feel it is my boy. I wish I could stay by his side as he goes through the sacrifice. Singapore NS sounds like a better place then Youth Court. Yixin will not go through a massive personal "sacrifice" during NS.

I told you that with FGo I wanted my son to pay a price for inflicting this much distress on his parents. That's a subconscious motivation, until now. "Heavy price" -- you said. You pointed out Yixin is only 15 and is unlikely going out of his way to torment his parents. He chose those retaliation actions 1) out of despair 2) desparately trying to get back his lifeline i.e. the iphone. I recognize that but I can't leave his retaliation unpunished. I feel I must strike back. My wife would say "Let's smash this phone."

Revenge? Perhaps I'm taking revenge on my 15-year-old boy when I threaten him with FGO. Bullying?

Browbeating? (for want of a better English word) Perhaps I have an urge to subdue and tame my son's adverse-reactions. I have a tendency to perceive him as a wild horse to be subdued, though I never apply physical strength.

loss of control over Yixin -- when I admit I'm unable to control my son, that's one side of the coin. The other side is an admission that I'm unable to control my own emotions in the face of his challenge.

You pointed out that when parents somehow admit defeat, we could inadvertently strengthen Yixin's power. After we delare we have given up, we often remember the experience as a failure, a defeat, an BPC evidence to show the yourth court that "Look, this is beyond parents' control."

To sever the chain reaction of 

  "phone-confiscation -> Yixin's adverse-reaction -> parent overpowered/defeated -> BPC -> FGO",

.. I could, at least in theory, cut the link after "adverse-reaction". Stay cool and calm. Show minimal fear and frustration. Take it in my strade like how I handle my ED issue, or a hopeless performance review, an unfair and unbearable boss, an "exotic" investment turning ugly.

Q: Every parent has frustrating experiences trying to "tame" a teenager, but when do those war stories cross over to become evidence of BPC? What's the criteria?

Yixin's adverse-reactions are more often verbal than physical. Even if physical, they are seldom strong enough to pose a serious threat to people's safety and wellbeing. Instead, there is usually an emotional over-reaction in one of the parents, before parents feel overpowered/failure/defeat/BPC. In terms of fff, mom and dad do enter fight mode. Flight mode is engaged when we the parent leaves home or I ask Yixin to hurry up and go somewhere (with his phone). It is interesting to note that Yixin doesn't show any fff except fight-mode.

In the youth court, perhaps my claim of BPC will be attributed to aggressive reactions of 70% Yixin + 30% parents?

I still foresee an "endless cycle" of behavior-improvement, relapse, conflict, adverse-reaction, overpowered,,, but I didn't give enough credit to behavior-improvements. Celebrate every small improvement ... is valid advice.

Email counselling provides me an outlet to express myself, and to be heard, even if you give only brief replies.
