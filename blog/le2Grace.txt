-- 14 Dec 2024 around 7pm, Mom asked me to return home quickly. Yixin had locked himself in Mom's room and threatened to smash her properties (skincare)

Cause? After Yixin go up 2pm, everyone agreed to cycling at east coast.  Then Mom complained about Yixin's uncooperative behavior and declared "No mood. I will bring meimei elsewhere. You can go out with Dad." How did Yixin react in anger?

In a similar November situation, Yixin snatched Mom's phone to prevent her from going out, then forcefully resisted me when I pulled the phone from him. I decided to call police, to avoid a wrestle.

This time (14 Dec), Yixin didn't snatch (better than before) or block Mom's departure. He demanded that Mom stick to earlier plan (cycling), even though 7pm was already dark. I decided to be non-judgemental. I stood outside the door and persuaded him (unsuccessfully) "let dad in just to talk." Afer a long standoff, after Yixin smashed some bottles, after Mom/meimei went out to Orchard, Yixin told me through closed door "Ask Mom to come back." She did. Yixin told her "Cycle to Bishan park" (this was 9pm). I then persuaded her to accept. Yixin opened the door to let Mom clean up the debris.

-- 17 Dec 2024 I came home for dinner. Yixin rarely eats with family, but this time he did sit down with Mom to eat her cooking. (He told me "I don't want to sit with you. Let me finish dinner first." I shrugged.) During dinner, he started to "hug" Mom repeatedly until she became ... miserable -- she was physically unable to eat her food, begged for him to stop, and cried with tears. Physically she was helpless. Yixin continued teasing Mom. Her tears and plea seemed to give him satisfaction.

I (and meimei) was listening to it from my room. All too familiar, so I didn't intervene (except urging Yixin to open his eyes and see the PAIN, and stop harassing). Then I shouted to my wife "If you want to show him how you feel, wailing is not enough. You can flip the dining table." This was the first trigger for Yixin.

After an eerie silence in Yixin, he declared that he had no appetite. I then sat at the same table to finish the leftovers. Then Yixin's anger emerged. He accused me of destroying his appetite. He threatened "You said flip the table. You have no right to eat the food." He then walked over, grabbed the food and threatened to dump it. (Over the previous week, he did dump Mom's food and smash meimei's bottle.)  Mom stopped him. Then he took the same food to the sofa. All the while, I was seated at the dining table, arguing with Yixin why I had the right to make that suggestion to Mom. 

A few minutes later, I felt "Enough is enough", walked to sofa, snatched the food (plate) from Yixin and started walking to kitchen. (The second trigger.) Sensing his aggression, I said "You said I can't eat. I won't eat. I will only store it in kitchen." Useless. Yixin quickly followed me and made a serious attempt to grab the plate. I was lucky to put the plate on the nearest cabinet. I knew he wanted to smash, so I openly challenged him "If you want to flip the plate, then you have to pass me first." Within 2 seconds, he overpowered me (with his full physical strength) and smashed the plate and food on the floor. Shocked, I then witnessed Yixin smashing my laptop (damaged) with a bang. He also took my office backpack and smashed and kicked it repeatedly, in violent anger.

Mom and sister were speechless. I decided to remain calm -- "Avoid losing my cool; avoid escalation; avoid physical". I said I have to call the police to stop the rampage. I was going out with a phone in hand, when Yixin stopped me. He then used his full force, again, to prevent me leaving. Meimei passed me the key. I then escaped and called 999. Yixin ran away from home. On his way out, I shouted to him "Come back early. Don't hurt yourself."

I met police at home for 2 hours. Police noticed minor bruises on me, and laptop damage. I told police I would not pursue court case (or FGO) against Yixin. I love my son. I want him to get treatment (he has refused since July).

I told police "Next time, if Mom or my daughter feel unsafe and call police, Yixin would overpower them before they could call police."

When police asked about recent violence increase, I briefly listed
* snatching Mom's phone by force
* pounding on bathroom door when Mom was taking shower inside
* forcing his way into Mom/meimei's bedroom .. victims unable to sleep.
* punching and kicking meimei

-- Am feeling so disgusted by my son that I wan to rent a place outside. Cost would be around $1000/M. I would visit home once a while, but I can leave as soon as I feel uncomfortable about my son. 

Food is not a problem. My daughter may suffer to some extent. 

I feel this option is better than sending my son to court (Mom 100% objecting. Even without a conviction, the lengthy (emotionally draining) legal process would drive a wedge into my family.
