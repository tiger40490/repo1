Hi Grace,

I'm writing to you more frequently for a reason. The family disharmony (sometimes conflict), Yxin's OCD/ODD and resurgent suicidal thoughts, distress in parents, disrruption of everyone's nightly sleep (including impact on my cardiovascular health), Yixin's threats to skip exams, join crime gangs, or end his life,,, have prompted me and Mom to engage IMH Child Guidance Clinic, Family Service Centre, TOUCH commnity service, the neighborhood police, and private (commercial) counselling. Earlier in 2024, I also enquired about FGO.

Some of these resources are supposed to focus on Yixin but he has often refused. Therefore, most of the recent assistance has been for-parents. 

Each form of assistance has a cost in terms of logistics and ... time. Huge amount of time we (parent and the service-provider) have to spend just to explain the situation receive some attention.

( Anonymous hotline is the least costly, logistically, but the counsellor has no  historical record for case management. )

In terms of cost, the most efficient channel of assistance is OCFA email counselling. I take my time to reflect in words, as a form of self-analysis, self-help,, Each email I sent you takes 2 to 4 hours and at least three revisions. Each revision of my draft email represents a small step forward in understanding of the situation and self-understanding. It's therapeutic and sometimes self-healing, and a slow process.

No such process when I engage with other organizations and express our pains _verbally_. ( Some fellow parents may use music and drawing to express their pain .. even more therapeutic. However, only English words help us engage with service providers. )

You don't need to reply in details, esp. if I send you multiple emails.

Last week, Mom told me she wished that she had not given birth to this child. (I actually said basically the same thing to my father months ago.) She has broken down many times since last year. She is scared of losing "face", but I have seen her choking up in front of teachers and cousellers. She also kneeled in front of Yixin multiple times.

A few recurring themes:

* positive parenting .. I refuse to give up on Yixin. I will remember to praise him, directly or behind his back. Mom is often a more positive parent than me.

* resilience .. Yixin showed some amount of resilience during O-levels. I am not so resilient. Nevertheless sometimes, I play the role model for Mom. Most of the time, I see resilience and strength in her.

* constant disappointment .. Yixin is not such a disappointment as a student. I'm fairly cool about academic peer-comparison.

* adoptive parents .. I think an adoptive parent would focus on Yixin's character, health, social circle. Grades are his responsibility, not parents' responsibility. I accept my son with all his imperfections. 

* safety boundaries
