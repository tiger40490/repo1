Hi Grace,

I'm writing to you more frequently for a reason. The family disharmony (conflict), Yxin's OCD/ODD and resurgent suicidal thoughts, distress in parents, disrruption of everyone's nightly sleep (including impact on my cardiovascular health), Yixin's threats to skip exams, join crime gangs, or end his life,,, have prompted me and Mom to engage with IMH Child Guidance Clinic, Family Service Centre, TOUCH commnity service, the neighborhood police, and private (commercial) counselling. Earlier in 2024, I also enquired about FGO.

Some of these resources are supposed to focus on Yixin but he has often refused. Therefore, most of the recent assistance has been for-parents.

Each form of assistance has a cost in terms of logistics and ... time. Huge amount of time we (parent and the service-provider) have to spend just to explain the situation and receive attention.

( Anonymous hotline is the least costly, logistically, but those counsellors have no  historical record for case management. )

In terms of cost, the most efficient channel of assistance is OCFA email counselling. I take my time to reflect in words, as a form of self-analysis, self-help,, Each email I sent you takes 2 to 4 hours and at least three revisions. Each revision of my draft email represents a small step forward in understanding of the situation and self-understanding. It's therapeutic and sometimes self-healing, and a slow process.

No such process when I engage with other organizations _verbally_. ( Some fellow parents may use music and drawing to express their pain .. even more therapeutic. However, only English words help us engage with service providers. )

You don't need to reply in details, esp. if I send you multiple emails. Below are some updates.

Last week, Mom told me she wished that she had not given birth to this child. She has broken down many times since last year. She is scared of losing "face", but I have seen her choking up in front of teachers and cousellers. She also kneeled in front of Yixin once.

A few recurring themes:

* positive parenting .. I refuse to give up on Yixin. I will remember to praise him, directly or behind his back. Mom is often a more positive parent than me.

* resilience .. Yixin showed some amount of resilience during O-levels. I am not highly resilient. Nevertheless, sometimes I have to play the role model for Mom. Most of the time, I see resilience and strength in her. A strong woman.

* constant disappointment .. Yixin is not such a disappointment as a student. I'm fairly cool about academic peer-comparison.

* adoptive parents .. I think an adoptive parent would focus on Yixin's character, health, social circle. Grades are his responsibility, not parents' responsibility. I accept my son with all his imperfections. 

* safety boundaries at home .. Use of physical force at home has become an everyday event, effectively normalized, but we have forgotten its danger. Daily door slamming is a neglected source of injury. Some family members (unnamed and unconfirmed) have pointed weapons at one another.

Yixin is fearless and beyond parental control .. He needs a healthy dose of fear-of-law.

On 9 Nov 2024, I finally called 999 from home, when Yixin snatched Mom's phone, and forcibly refused to release it. Background: Mom wanted to go out with little sister. Yixin wanted to join. Mom said "only if you shower first" (no shower since 5 Oct). 

Without her phone, Mom was then unable to go out. Sister also failed to get the phone from Yixin. I tried to take it but met with fierce resistance. Instead of losing my temper and a peaceful heartbeat, instead of raising my voice and blood pressure, instead of waiting indefinitely for Yixin to relent, I chose to avoid the danger of a wrestle, and dialed 999. Police came over some 30 minutes later but by then, Mom had managed to get her phone from Yixin and left. I met police downstairs. I told them I had a heart condition and must avoid physical fights. They confirmed that tussles for phone could be potentially dangerous, so calling police was indeed the safer option.

Police priorities are .. 1) injury 2) no one should live in fear. (Heart attack risk is not a priority to police.) Police won't care about furniture damage, but up to 2022, we had had 2 doors damaged beyond repair, both by an angry Yixin. Yixin also threw chairs on the floor in protest to my forcible action.

Mom might, as a last resort, threaten a divorce (or a seperation) to stop my attempt to call in law-enforcement. Law-enforcement is available to prevent physical harm in the family, but I suspect that deep inside, she would rather get injured (during a tussle) than get Yixin investigated. I have told her that Yixin has not committed crimes.

Yixin is nearly fearless about Police/court/mentalHospital. Whenever I mention those, Yixin would accuse me in front of Mom. ("A loving parent would never do that.") On the other hand, Yixin is clever to present a "typical rebellious teenager" image to investigators. He is increasingly confident that the authorities would leave it as a minor family issue.
