--fuxi or update post on wp hosting:
once I get used to my customized WP interface, some of the free WP blogs may feel inconvenient.
I may need to move them to blogger

I think xh.fu is relatively free (working 4h/d) and hopefully available to help me by email, call or even in-person.
If it takes more time, I will pay him a consulting fee.

-- fuxi: consider deleting blogposts about FSM funds and FXO trading

-- new: growing git-blog files
as of 15 Nov 2020, my git blog files are much bigger than before, proving that I am spending less time publishing blog online. this is a good change.

More important is piano, helping kids (on math...), localSys, wellness activities, even family outing

However, the large amount of no-blog or fuxi content in git-blogging is slow me down... growing baggage. Need to be removed sooner or later

git blogging proved effective when growing a post incrementally. 
it becomes ineffective when a file grows too big, and review tcost explodes.
