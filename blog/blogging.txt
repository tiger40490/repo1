Each activity below can be recreation and (like blogging) soak up huge amount of spare time, but a times each can play a more constructive role, perhaps a critical support

comparison shopping -- can be relaxing and even therapeutic 
paining -- Churchill
workout -- therapeutic
blogging -- both recreation and a coping device.
As recreation it tends to soak up most of my spare time, competing with 
* workout
* localSys study
* coding drill

As coping device it is heavily relied on all the time. Not a substance abuse and Should not be criminalized..

Sometimes these different roles are not easily discernable and consequently the zsms kicks in...

* reviewing growing content of git blogging files
* git merge conflict
* carrying laptop around -- need to disable the wake-up password
