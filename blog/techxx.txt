-- update or new: threading in c++ less popular than in java
Concurrency dev is difficult, in both design and the basic building blocks as language constructs. Java makes it easier, much easier than pthreads and std::thread. It is so easy that java interviews routinely include some concurrency questions.

Factor: the c++ shops I try are all trading shops. They choose c++ for latency. To optimize latency, STM is best, rather than multi-threading. So I think their c++ threading questions are light.

-- new: misstep: accidental amend of last pushed commit
frequent mistake:

1) I commit a file on branch3, and git-push
2) I revise recent change and git-commit-amend. This is a misstep, as the new tip of branch3 is a modified version of the origin/branch3. The two branches have divered.
3) when I git-push, I fail

Simple solution: 
1) back up affected files
2) git reset origin/branch3
3) git commit # creates a new commit on top of the origin/branch3 tip
4) git push
