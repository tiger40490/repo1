-- new: why some type of problems are more popular on question banks
Most coding interviews last 30m only.

array problems are easy to explain/understand, easy (for an interviewer) to set up

Threading questions are much harder to set up and test.

In python dict initilization, you may want to specify the keys in a consistent order. The order is preserved when you print myDict.keys()

-- new or fuxi: misstep: accidental amend of last pushed commit
frequent mistake:

1) I commit a file on branch3, and git-push
2) I revise recent changes and git-amend. This is a misstep, as the new branch3 and origin/branch3 have diverged. 
3) error when I git-push

Simple solution: 
1) back up affected files
2) git reset origin/branch3 #without --hard
3) git commit # creates a new commit on top of the origin/branch3 tip
4) git push
