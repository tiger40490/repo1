Adaptive (a finIT firm) have worked within many banks and used all the mainstream messaging middlewares available in the industry. Experience has taught us, that peer-to-peer messaging system is more flexible than broker based messaging systems and requires less operational overhead. You donâ€™t need additional servers (or hardware appliances) to use it, which are generally organised as shared infrastructure and become an organisational bottleneck for development teams.

If a pull request branch can't be rebased onto master, sometimes it can be squash-merged.

-- new or update: detect stuck thread in a pool
weblogic marks a pooled thread as stuck if it is busy for 10min (configurable). Weblogic is designed for a large patient queue, so each patient should not take 10min.

For a custom application, this doesn't work. A thread can be busy and productive for any amount of time.

Purpose of detection is not per-patient intervention. Purpose is hospital mgmt such as thread pool config, memory increase, or load balancing.
-- new: patient Q
good metaphor for thread pool and producer/consumer. The patient queue can be 60,000 in a reasonable design (Weblogic)

if a window dosesn't show up even though it is on the taskbar, then it's hidden somewhere. You can press control-shift and rightClick on the taskbar item.

-- new or update on signal+socket
signals in windows? not popular

real time signals are a new Posix concept... not really low-latency. 
Low latency sockets don't rely on signals for immediate action

Many signals are self-sent from the same process. I think timer alarm is one example. Sockets is another example. However, keyboard signals like Ctrl-C are not self-sent.

Signal is designed to be asynch, seldom immediate, though the scheduler may preempt whatever is running and give the next time slice to the signal's target process sooner than normal.

One of the most common signals is SIGSEGV. The default signal handler function performs a core dump. There's no process to preempt. However, the current process may not check its signal table until some instructions later, and then run the signal handler.

-- fuxi: closest ancestors of c/c++
For c++
#1 is C
#2 is Simula

For C, the #1 is the B language. It explains the naming of "C"

-- new: a few minor criticisms of c++
An obscure but simple shortcoming of c++ lies in the iostream. There is a shared mutable global state in the global variables cout (and cerr). Every call to setXXX would permanently update the global state until updated again.

iterator invalidation .. a common gotcha

private methods are exposed in class header files.
