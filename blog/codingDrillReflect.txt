I think many (most?) candidates consider IDE coding easier than white-board. I think they rely on IDE as a coding aid.

If on white-board or paper, my relative performance is A-, then on IDE i would score B

my relative weakness on IDE is ECT speed
my relative strength on white-board is clarity of thought

--new blogpost:
I spent 2-4 hours on the knapsack problem. Many would consider it overspent. This kind of "conventional" view tend to destroy the precious satisfaction.

Some coders complete it in a hurry and move on. They may not compare with the comboSum problem.

They may not learn a lot by doing it quickly. I wouldn't learn much if I do that.

--no blogpost: matrix problems are mostly grid problems

--the motivation and joy of coding drill is one of the reasons to feel lucky
( Comparison -- reading tech books is hard for most peers, but i derive joy and i keep a blog)

However this joy is precious.. more fleeting than tech reading

--new blogpost: classic generator problems (such as combo with redraw, or phonePad...) are not simple for me or for other people. The recursion-in-loop magic is beyond our comprehension.

I feel these algos are building blocks of many problems, both real-world problems and quiz problems.

Many of them are DP problems.
--I once said if a problem is so original that none of the common technique apply, then I would have an advantage.
Now I think all the problems ever asked have some optimal solution

--new blogpost: single(or two)-str problems 
usually need some auxDS, otherwise there's not much to work with

However I have no advantage with the auxDS in these problems.

some elegant solutions are not optimal but still welcome by interviewers

moving-window max -- why my showman idea was not developed into the deque solution?

The problems I'm interested in might be harder than required? I think some financial firms don't use tough speed coding. Instead, they focus on
* language features
* pure algo
* simple speed-coding problems
