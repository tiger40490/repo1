For these problems the first and main challenge is getting a good sample of worst dataset. How do I avoid wasting time in real time?

--new: Many non-optimal solutions are worthwhile.
Some of them offer insight into the problems, in terms of structure, constraints...
Some of them are non-optimal but optimal solutions to modified problems.
Some of them are non-optimal but break down the original problem into smaller, familiar problems.
Some of them are non-optimal but offer reusable techniques
Some of them are non-optimal but very short and clever
Some of them (my homemade) are non-optimal but unique and innovative ... worthwhile achievements.
Some of them are non-optimal but good enough for "2nd-tier" coding interviews...i.e. less-demanding

Q: your real goals, motivations for coding drill? Absorbency? Burning pleasure? Satisfaction (as Rahul puts it)? Maintaining a hobby?
So defocus can help. The focus on "optimal" creates negativity.

Q: how could I grow my ranking in coding test as I did in java/c++ QQ?

Need to prioritize 1 or 2 among the formats as described in google sheet. 
Leave out speed coding and weekend assignments. (This doesn't mean we give up on those fronts.) It means I accept my limitations as an aging developer.

Attend more interviews, perhaps remotely.

Focus on absorbency, pattern recognition
