I think some coding problems are perceived similar to basic java knowledge. A self-respecting coder is expected to know all the "easy" problems.

As such, we need memory refresh ..

--questioning the value of coding drill is extremely harmful. I need 1st-aid

A student's approach to statistics is different from a mathematician's. Likewise, I feel the intern way of coding drill is not good for me
* not long-term commitment. I believe most of them would stop after getting a job.
* not in-depth
* not aimed at deep learning and retention
* more like cram

However an unbiased interviewer/observer could find the student stronger than me.

Q: should I read hints on 20 easy and popular problems on geek4geek? I learned many basic coding techniques from books

even though conventional wisdom says i need to practice speed coding till i can complete 2 "medium" problems in 40 minutes, I will take the bet that I don't need to. 

Such a practice is too painful. I'd rather go in with known risk of rejection than pushing myself to do painful practice (consider yoga)

speed is more important than fine quality. I need to unlearn what FB seminar preached.

the new leetcode sub-culture is like math practice my son (and me at his age) needs to do. If you don't bother to practice then you will fail to qualify. There are tests in his school throughout the year. He will likely fail most of them. 

It's really funny that me and my son are in exactly the same situation. Absorbency is both ability and effort.

--new blogpost: cod`drill^ quant self-study
quant knowledge used to be a halo, now replaced by coding IV skills like
* DP, recursion
* data structures
* speed coding 

I now feel all of these + QQ knowledge are all white elephants not directly relevant to GTD

In 2012 When I was studying quant in my spare time, I was on a powerful ascent. In the subsequent years, I gradually lost steam. The quant sector was shrinking and market depth was disappointing.

Since 2018, my coding drill feels very relevant, even though the gap behind the strong players continues to be a pain and a de-motivation.  When I stop comparing myself with the stronger players, I would feel my improvement in a highly valuable skill

--new blogpost: with family distraction,cod`drill easier than QQ blogging@@
I feel coding drill is more rewarding, more satisfying, less guilty

--new blogpost
Given my limited bandwidth, I try to focus on the high value problems. I tend to spend long hours on each problem. My idea of "high value" is often about classics, not about "frequency".

Even with careful selection, i still find it rather futile -- many of the problems I was asked are not related to my studied problems.

I feel I need to detach/disengage from the end result (technical wins). Enjoy the journey of focused engagement. Enjoy the self-improvement and self-mastery. 

Prefer remote CIV. Avoid the cost of on-site interviews -- they are likely to frustrate.
 
--new blogpost: lucky:free from negativity@CIV #CSY
i feel  lucky about freedom from negativity towards coding drill. 

(However, i do have my preference how to practice. A food lover still has her preferred cooking methods.)

Major advantage! Most of my peers are bogged down by this negativity.

--new blogpost cod`drill outlasting C++self-study
Am confident that my coding drill will become a "long-term" hobby like java/c++ QQ, better than c#/quant/swing QQ. 

Anti-aging.

enjoyable? Yes possible and real. Not theoretical.

I think coding drill may even outlast c++ QQ self-study but crucially my c++ QQ has reached critical mass.

Q: how could I grow my ranking in coding test as I did in java/c++ QQ?
A: practice as fresh grads do. Note my competitors tend to be younger including fresh grads.

Need to prioritize 1 or 2 among the formats as described in google sheet. 
Leave out speed coding and weekend assignments. (This doesn't mean we give up on those fronts.) It means I accept my limitations as an aging developer.

The problems I'm interested in might be harder than the 45-min white board types. 

I think some financial firms don't use tough speed coding. Instead, they focus on
* language features
* threading (I count 9+ such questions)
* pure algo, perhaps over phone
* simple speed-coding problems

Few companies use on-site tough speed coding.
