Q: how could I grow my ranking in coding test as I did in java/c++ QQ?

Note my competitors tend to be younger.

I think QQ is mostly a Wall st practice, whereas coding test is mostly a west coast practice

Need to prioritize among the formats as described in google sheet. Leave out speed coding and weekend assignments. This doesn't mean we give up on some fronts. It does mean I accept my limitations as an aging developer

The problems I'm interested in might be harder than required? I think some financial firms don't use tough speed coding. Instead, they focus on
* language features
* pure algo
* simple speed-coding problems
