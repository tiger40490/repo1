Q: how could I grow my ranking in coding test as I did in java/c++ QQ?

Note my competitors tend to be younger.

I think QQ is mostly a Wall st practice, whereas coding test is mostly a west coast practice

Need to prioritize among the formats as described in google sheet. Leave out speed coding and weekend assignments. This doesn't mean we give up on some fronts. It does mean I accept my limitations as an aging developer

Over a few months, my python ECT speed is now faster than java/c++.
Even though I did so many c++ coding problems, my ect speed is still much worse than java

--new blogpost: joy@cod`drill=luck
the motivation and joy of coding drill (esp. review and refinement) is one of the reasons to feel lucky
( Comparison -- reading tech books is hard for most peers, but i derive joy and i keep a blog )

However this joy is precious.. more fleeting than tech reading

The problems I'm interested in might be harder than required? I think some financial firms don't use tough speed coding. Instead, they focus on
* language features
* pure algo
* simple speed-coding problems
