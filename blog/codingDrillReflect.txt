--new blogpost: 
over a few months, my python ECT speed is now faster than java/c++
even though I did so many c++ coding problems, my ect speed is still much worse than java

--new blogpost: the motivation and joy of coding drill is one of the reasons to feel lucky
( Comparison -- reading tech books is hard for most peers, but i derive joy and i keep a blog)

However this joy is precious.. more fleeting than tech reading

--I once said if a problem is so original that none of the common technique apply, then I would have an advantage.
Now I think all the problems ever asked have some optimal solution
--no blogpost
The problems I'm interested in might be harder than required? I think some financial firms don't use tough speed coding. Instead, they focus on
* language features
* pure algo
* simple speed-coding problems
