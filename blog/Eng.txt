Movie characters, Brithsh/American ladies in their 50s, are supposed to display an accumulation of wealth, wisdom, wellness[1], grace/dignity... but I think the most prominent superiority of the group is the English language.

[1] the truly wise and affluent Brits/Americans (or any nationality) would prioritize wellness over material wealth.

-- update  https://vtb6drive.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=9964&action=edit or new: handicap: driving vs English
Many of my friends have a handicap in English writing

Consider my MLP colleagues vs Sophia/Y.Zhang/Rong.Zhu

Oral English has a lower entry barrier so fewer friends have that handicap but consider SY.Chang, Kevin/Gary, Rong

The English handicap affects half the "community" they are in, but driving handicap affects only me.

Flexibility isÂ a handicap. Empathy was a personal handicap. English was a handicap in my earlier years in Singapore.

Driving is a personal weakness/handicap, more physical than English language handicap.

I need a much higher budget just for learning to drive. I already spent $2k+. Need to be $10k.
The vehicle doesn't have to be the strongest or "safest". I would say average safety rating is sufficient. 

I would need a "budget" for paying fines.

I also need a huge tBudget for learning and "managing" license + vehicle.

For the first 1 or 2 years, don't drive the family at all. Even in local street, you can get hit or drive off the road and hit something dangerous.

Q: How critical was English during the early 2007 adaptation/adjustment[actually a struggle] to living in USA?

Luckily, in early 2007 my English proved adequate, thanks to the formal education in SG and on-the-job training in SG, and my years of self-practice in emails, in-depth discussions with non-Chinese friends.

From early 2007, I had no difficulty reading (any tough material) and .. listening [my traditional weakness]!

I was a fairly fluent speaker in 2007. No one said I had a strong accent like half the subcontinent coworkers, whose /oral/ English was good enough for an offshore worksite.
The Singapore/Malaysia and Hongkong accent was mild in constrast to millions of immigrants speaking English "dialects" from Eastern Europe, middle east, central Asia, S.E.Asia,,,,

In each ethnic group, some 5 to 20% [1] of the immigrants speak decent English, usually due to education, but conceivably due to everyday practice (without education) or untrained talent -- consider my sister and my wife.

[1] Among the Mexican immigrants, that percentage is lower because proportionally many of them came in without a work visa or student visa.

Q: how did my wife cope with English?

I have hitherto left out proficiency in writing. Not an "everyday" proficiency, more of an advanced skill. Challenging for most immigrants. Even native speakers (esp. the less educated) struggle with many non-trivial tasks. 
Writing is a trained skill like painting, public speaking, .... Training takes years. I was generally well-trained over the prior decades since 1991. Now in 2022, I consider myself "well-trained" when benchmarked to the average native SPEAKER.
