==== new: ##Chn bank accts
Common cost: ADBFB
Common cost: cross-bank ATM.. LGlp
Common tcost: revive a dormant/de-activated account
Common tcost: replace expired passport.. Need to bring old + new passports to a branch. If you don't update, then you will face difficulty when you bring an unrecognized passport to branches.

Given the costs, here are the justifications:
J4: e-payment 
J4: use ATM to avoid large physical amount

Common non-trivial operations: 
operation: check balance, cash-out
operation: deposit at ATM or transfer-in. [Transfer-out requires SMS OTP sent to a real-name phone number :( ]

Compared to Cambodia, Philippines, China banks are better .. easy2visit; 24H hotline; 

-- ICBC
ADBFB: waived on first ATM card

To avoid "dormant", need some in/out every 6 months. Grandparents an withdraw then deposit some amount.

-- HSBC
ADBFB? Stringent :( Global assessment. If FB, then need to downgrade Sgp account, but China account will incur FB fee of RMB 300/M. At that time, I may need to keep rmb 500k in China acct.
