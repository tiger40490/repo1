Q: given the cashflow high ground, how could H.Yi improve their marriage and communication.

Suprisingly, the high ground doesn't provide enough of a buffer of protection against marital risks. The high ground improves risks related to family cashflow, but the high-earning wife is also very independent and doesn't want to play a supporting role to the husband. Not a risk factor in itself, but in some cases, this can indirectly create new risks. Many divorce cases involve two high-income earners.

A: professional couple counselling. This service costs a lot in the U.S.
A: hire a maid to reduce the home-making workload on each parent

Perhaps emmigrate to a lower-income country where systems are less complex and everyday life more convenient.
