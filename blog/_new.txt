-- prepare GEX 
take leave 
bring charger
bring jacket, wear pants

-- update AMB j4:
see also hidden barrier

The AMB course got me started thinking hard about this recreation. 
The hidden barrier and internal roadblock (more visual than "resistance") is strong and easily underestimated. Therefore am likely to give up.
The course is more effective than reading a few web pages for 10m.
