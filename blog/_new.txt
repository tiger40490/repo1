-- fuxi or new:
why by and large older people tend to become better (verbal) communicators? because of daily practice and continuous learning.
The "practice" is interactive and the learning comes with immediate and continuous feedback.

Exception -- if a retiree becomes isolated he may lose his vocabulary, among other things.

Exception -- some less-used vocab may become rusty. I guess writing a dairy helps you retain vocabulary.
