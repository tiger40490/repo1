-new blogpost: explicit^ambiguous performance feedback
If I'm below average in the team, but manager doesn't create a stigma out of it, then I am OK ... happy and contended. I can simply tell myself that other guys are very bright and have longer experience with the local system.

I really fear explicit feedback, but management best practice encourage explicit feedback. Josh is not doing that and am extremely grateful.

I told Greg about my situation and kind of sought more explicit feedback. I think that's not necessary. I really prefer more implicit or ambiguous feedback
--new blogpost: avoid hot domains that attract young competitors
I feel clearly less in-demand as I age. 
Perhaps I should shift towards domains that young guys avoid -- like c++?

--new blogpost: PIP stress worse than..
Indeed rejection pain=way below stigma/pip
I had high hopes for Indeed, so the pain is proportional to the height, but it's below 2% of the amount of pain from stigma of pip/damagedGood

I do feel inferior in terms of coding test skills, but this feeling is not even 10% of the pain from stigma/pip/damagedGood

My son's academic situation creates stress but still below 20% of the stress of PIP

When my investment (like BGC) is in trouble, the stress is real, but way below 5% of the stress due to stigma/pip

--new blogpost: gains from Indeed experience #worth the $sacrifice
* gain -- first hand intuition about what algo topics are possibly out of scope at these interviews
* gain -- first hand knowledge of young competition
* gain -- experience with SDI, comparable to Nsdq
* gain -- real insight into where I'm lacking. battleground experience with tough algo questions. I told my son he needs to embrace himself for the real exams. I think I can improve my battleground performance
* gain -- some in-depth discussions on age discrimination

MLP interview was a speculative effort but now turns out rather important. Because of it I feel more reassured now.

--new blogpost: if not4$$,y I sacrifice so much2reenter U.S.
i didn't need high salary so badly, so what's the real reasons why I sacrifice so much to re-enter U.S.?
rebuild confidence about career/financial foundation for next 25Y, since my passive-income/asset/burn-rate profile is far from comfortable
rebuild self esteem.. stigma?

--no blogpost:
quant knowledge used to be a halo, now replaced by coding IV skills like
* DP, recursion
* data structures
* speed coding 

I now feel all of these + QQ knowledge are all white elephants not directly relevant to GTD
