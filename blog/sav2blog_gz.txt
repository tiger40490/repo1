Even though Indeed hiring team claims to be language agnostic and don't care about your app domain, their architecture questions are gear towards web2.0 shops

--new blogpost: explicit^ambiguous performance feedback
If I'm below average in the team, but manager doesn't create a stigma out of it, then I am safe from the deadly hazard ... happy and contended. I can simply tell myself that other guys are very bright and have longer experience with the local system.

I really fear explicit feedback, but management best practice encourage explicit feedback. Josh is not doing that and am extremely grateful.

I told Greg about my situation and kind of sought more explicit feedback. I think that's not necessary. I really prefer more implicit or ambiguous feedback

I often imagine being one of the old non-VP (or VP) guys in MS. If I'm just mediocre, I would worry (constantly) about layoff -- not the loss of livelihood but loss of pride. As contractor, I would go out after N years without an explicit reason. To me, the financial impact is tolerable, but the explicit negative assessment is a deadly blow.

--new blogpost: avoid hot domains that attract young competitors
I feel clearly less in-demand as I age. 
Perhaps I should shift towards domains that young guys avoid -- like c++?

--new blogpost: PIP stress worse than..
Indeed rejection pain=way below stigma/pip
* I had high hopes for Indeed, so the pain is proportional to the height, but it's below 2% of the amount of pain from stigma of pip/damagedGood
* I do feel inferior in terms of coding test skills, but this feeling is not even 10% of the pain from stigma/pip/damagedGood

My son's academic situation creates stress but still below 10% of the stress of PIP

When my investment (like BGC) is in trouble, the stress is real, but way below 5% of the stress due to stigma/pip

--update blogpost on indeed feedback
Unlike what I predicted to Ellen, the Indeed CIV was enjoyable. I didn't get stuck completely. i made satisfactory progress even though not enough by Indeed standard.

I didn't feel so tired and beaten afterwards. I felt hopeful 

Yes I know my gap now, but i also feel more "plugged into the new economy" than before.
--new blogpost: if not4$$,  y I sacrifice so much2reenter U.S.
i didn't need high salary so badly, so what's the real reasons why I sacrifice so much to re-enter U.S.?
rebuild confidence about career/financial foundation for next 25Y, since my passive-income/asset/burn-rate profile is far from comfortable
rebuild self esteem.. stigma?

--no blogpost: delights: engaged,leverage,strategic.. 
[tags t_othRisk]
I feel my expectation was invariably too high in terms of strategic value, leverage and ROTI, therefore underwhelming. 
(engagement ... expectation was moderately too high) 
Against this backdrop, there are little delights, but stigma/respect (not salary!) was too huge as a factor and overshadowed those little delights. For a perspective, please look at the spreadsheet "predict next 3-5Y job satisfaction"

I chose a python job at Macq .. engaged for a few months, to my delight
I chose the c++ job at RTS .. engaged for 6 months, to my delight. 
* Reason: traction in interviews and also in GTD and zbs
* Reason: interviews
* Reason: socket QQ was in-demand
* Reason: QQ discussions with colleagues .. visible progress

Both job decisions produced good/superior leverage over 5Y.

I chose a c# job ... engaged for a year and then disengaged, shorter than expected. Leverage was good.

I chose a Quant dev job ... engaged for a year and never disengaged. Leverage was underwhelming.

I chose a c++ large scale eq OMS job ... engaged for a few months. Leverage is unknown

My c++/c#/quant/swing attempts now look commendable. 

--no blogpost: c#^java/c++ journeys
[tags t_below7]
my c# xx journey was exciting for 6M before OC and in first year in OC. In contrast, my core-java/c++ (less for jxee) journeys have generated superior ROTI (elusive) because 
* the interview topics are stable 
* market waves steered me to stick to (not abandon) these career directions

leverage? c# is lower but not bad. See separate blogpost

For all languages, there is no hike, no strategic value so at that level all underwhelming
--no blogpost:
quant knowledge used to be a halo, now replaced by coding IV skills like
* DP, recursion
* data structures
* speed coding 

I now feel all of these + QQ knowledge are all white elephants not directly relevant to GTD
