-- perhaps the big picture insight (Josh, Rahul) is equally imp as the local localSys, but i still feel figure-out speed is my real weakness.

-- self-img
I want to be seen as dedicated, motivated, committed ..
but I want to FEEL self-esteem regardless of GTD speed. 
To that end, Macq experience was a defining, watershed event, when I did my best but the standard was too high.

i feel good about my focus and my strength to resist the temptations. I hope this becomes a positive feedback loop of respect/confidence/self-esteem even without faster progress on projects

I think bosses like Josh would notice the effort even if without impressive progress.

light-duty, semi-retirement jobs providing more free time (mostly for self-learning, blogging). This is indeed a $-motivation because with more financial resources, I can afford to take such jobs at lower pay. In fact, I did pursue this route in my 2019 SG job search.
more days with grandparents -- need more unpaid leaves
-- now some motivations not so deep
better home location (not size) -- clean streets; shorter commute; reasonable school.. Eg Bayonne, JC
-- Now some 2ndary items
more time with kids? Outside top 5.
better (healthy) food? usually I can find cheaper alternatives 
workout classes? Usually not expensive
--what i look forward to over 6M
first earn the respect...
Am not really ambitious, so I will take more time off with family, possibly overseas trip to Penang, Thailand, Taiwan

--sugg: volunteer to take up prod issues selectively. Dig a bit on my own. Aim at connecting the dots and becoming independent with some part of the codebase.  Avoid "lossy learning"

However, some may say I'm exploring beyond the necessary. I think my learning style is slightly different, so i want to strike a balance
* some exploration about the localSys aimed at long term GTD
* not too much time wasted.

--no blog but deep impact
As soon as we start to work towards better salary , we are on a slippery slope. 
We may feel we are on a reasonable ground, with a reasonable goal, but down the slope there is irrationality, desperation, greed, self-hate, inferiority...
we tend to keep up with the Jones's. Many people compare with the wrong peer group .. including the web2.0 shops
We tend to neglect many valuable things that at end of our lives we would recognize as more important than the rat race

One of the jolting, awakening (一盆凉水) questions is - Granted other people earn a lot more, but i don't need that much money to live a comfortable life, so why do I feel inadequate so often?

I told many friends that I work hard to prepare for interviews but I am Very selective about where to join. 
I focus mostly on the salary level in the WallSt contract market, not the perm salaries. 
This kind of attitude is one small step towards a more rational, more pragmatic perception of the rat race

If I were in a high-cost location where typical household burn rate is 15k, then I would be under pressure to earn more just to keep up.

I told Rahul that I need to be independent to capture the engagement, but that's short term.

Over long term, what do I need to survive and thrive?
* sustained focus on localSys
* respect/appreciation
* not boxed into some unfavorable technology like high-churn
