* yes GS -- Everyone rated me Meet except deMunk who used the official rating to derail my transfer. Ironically, deMunk himself was forced out before I resigned.
* yes Qz -- I achieved Meet/Meet in Official, final record
* yes RTS -- despite Venkat's negative remarks (on every contractor), I was valued as one of the strong players and renewed
* probably OC -- mgr was under-performing. 
I proved myself competent among my team peers. 
After the performance warning, I didn't remain an under-performer.

Receiving a job offer from Goog, DRW, Tower, GS etc would have an extremely positive impact on my self image, even if I don't join them or salary is low.

The boost to self-image is probably much higher than expected and rather hard to measure.

Remember as I age my attractiveness to these employers would decline

--new blogpost: avoid hot domains that attract young competitors
I feel clearly less in-demand as I age. 
Perhaps I should shift towards domains that young guys avoid -- like c++/coreJava, back office, startups, lesser-known banks

telecom?

With CIV, it's crucial to manage the setbacks. 
Traditionally, one of my strengths is positive attitude to IV setbacks.
I have reason to believe I still have this strength.

It is easy to look at the gap and feel hopeless.

Parenting also requires this capacity. [[Learned optimism]]] listed Permanent as one hallmark of pessimists.

i had so many failures at c++ interviews before I started passing. Now I look like a c++ rock star to some 
I had so many failures at HFT interviews before I started passing at DRW, SIG, Tower
I had so many failures at remote speed coding before I started passing.

With inet companies including nsdq, I can see my rise in ranking. If I try 10 more times the chance of further progress is more than 50%.

I /may never/ become a rock star in these west coast CIVs but I see my potential as a dark horse in 1) white-board CIV, 2) pure-algo

java - exceeding expectations in the churn. Found 2nd life in web2.0
c# - underwhelming. Displace in web2.0
c++ - matching my expectation. slow decline. Efficiency advantage is eclipsed by java and some new languages
py - exceeding expectation
javascript - exceeding expectation
--update blogpost on ## self-esteem
Looks like every venture out of my tech sweet spot java/SQL/scripting... presents esteem-hazards (like health hazards) but dismal prospect in terms of self-esteem boost.

high-risk, low-return venture?

The health hazard is really nothing but one mgr's assessment. For my recent painful jobs, I continue to dismiss/ignore the possible boost to self-esteem --
* I conquered some of my biggest technology fears -- MSVS; c++ crash management; c++ large code navigation.. Other people may not agree, but my own experience proves that these challenges are harder than high-level dev (like web/scripting..). My fears were more deep-rooted.
* I built real mileage in c#. I even proved myself stronger than some c# veterans when I created a simple web server to dump log files for everyday troubleshooting.

--update blog on 'expert'
If I were a 5Y VP (or ED) I would doubt if I'm just a local expert or a recognized, accredited expert as proven on benchmarks/interviews.

Look at Shubin/Steve, the Sprite expert in London, Richard of Quoine .. 
Their expertise and value-add may be marginalized in the context of the current mainstream technologies

Even though Indeed hiring team claims to be language agnostic and don't care about your app domain, their architecture questions are gear towards web2.0 shops

There's a thinly veiled leaning towards java. 
If you use another language for your whiteboard, then you had better be very fast and sharp to defend your solution when it differs from the optimal java solution.

In reality, the solution you get using another language CAN be different from the optimal java solution.

--update blogpost on musicians and doctors.
When we watch a movie from Europe, India, Korea ... we can tell whether it has any international appeal or only limited local audience.

Similarly localSys knowledge has value only within a single company. The expertise I demonstrate in job interviews are relevant across many sites.

Quoine probably designed a tcp feed for internet clients, but in the industry, multicast feed is more industrial-strength, more advanced, more practical. Such expertise is more in-demand 

--no blogpost: delights: engaged,leverage,strategic.. 
[tags t_othRisk]
I feel my expectation was invariably too high in terms of strategic value, leverage and ROTI, therefore underwhelming. 
(engagement ... expectation was moderately too high) 
Against this backdrop, there are little delights, but stigma/respect (not salary!) was too huge as a factor and overshadowed those little delights. For a perspective, please look at the spreadsheet "predict next 3-5Y job satisfaction"

I chose a python job at Macq .. engaged for a few months, to my delight
I chose the c++ job at RTS .. engaged for 6 months, to my delight. 
* Reason: traction in interviews and also in GTD and zbs
* Reason: interviews
* Reason: socket QQ was in-demand
* Reason: QQ discussions with colleagues .. visible progress

Both job decisions produced good/superior leverage over 5Y.

I chose a c# job ... engaged for a year and then disengaged, shorter than expected. Leverage was good.

I chose a Quant dev job ... engaged for a year and never disengaged. Leverage was underwhelming.

I chose a c++ large scale eq OMS job ... engaged for a few months. Leverage is unknown

--no blogpost: c#^java/c++ journeys
[tags t_below7]
my c# xx journey was exciting for 6M before OC and in first year in OC. In contrast, my core-java/c++ (less for jxee) journeys have generated superior ROTI (elusive) because 
* the interview topics are stable 
* market waves steered me to stick to (not abandon) these career directions

leverage? c# is lower but not bad. See separate blogpost

For all languages, there is no hike, no strategic value so at that level all underwhelming
