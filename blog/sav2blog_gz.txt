--new: contract rate is not benchmarked against FTE
If my contract rate is higher than FTE team members, we say that it's not comparable as my employer gets a cut and I also pay more taxes and have no benefits.

If my contract rate is lower than FTE team members, then we often say it's due to market rate. Not sure why, but I don't feel inferior. 

This factor becomes crucial in a PIP situation. The FTE victim would get a donut bonus and donut raise, and her base would fall below some very junior team members .. unbearable humiliation. 

No such humiliation on a non-performing contractor. They just let the contract expire.
--new: old timers trapped ] lousy job #Davis
Some old timers change job but regret as new job turns out worse. 

Other old timers hear those war-stories and prefer the certainty of known pain in the current job. They don't feel confident they can find a better job.

Some old timers have a wife who completely opposes job change due to potential impact on family.

why I can afford to quit a job, stay home, and find a lower job? Because of burn rate, passive income and savings.

I think the boss wants to let him go but may feel merciful, so they keep him but give him shitty tasks and demand fast turnaround at good quality.... unreasonable/unfair workload.

Many people can't afford bench time. 
Many people won't take on a 6M contract.
Many people will never consider a voluntary pay cut
Many people worry about job loss so much that they work their ass off to keep the job, even if the workload is unreasonable/unfair. I think in GS I was like them .

--aging -- localSys (esp. learning large codebase) ... is taxing on the aging memory. 
I *guess* GregM (RTS) might be a cautionary tale. 
He relied on his theoretical knowledge to pass interviews, but not fast enough with local codebase

Is green field better than brown-field codebase? I guess so. Green-field projects are rarely given to a new joiner but contractors are often hired on green field budget. Look at Citi, 95G and volFitter !

Now consider this separate question: 
Q: Are the c++11 QQ topics a form of churn on the interview competition?
A: Yes but I feel the wore scene is localSys on the job. c++11 QQ is lighter.

Q: how about the Coding IV? still lighter stress than localSys. I can take my time.

sg job market remains as slow and thin as before. Still financial jobs constitute 90% of my job pool
JC has more suitable jobs than SG has including start-up.

Singapore non-finance companies simply can't afford because the main street dev salary is much lower than U.S.

The wall st salary level is largely influenced by west coast and also main street dev salary.

Like Black developers .. As an older Singaporean developer I also have higher visibility.
IFF I apply myself (localSys) and establish a foundation at a new site as Piroz does, I think I could survive and possibly show my hidden strengths.

However, at Stirt I was unable to outshine other guys.

At Macq, I was unable to impress bosses.

the IV successes define me.
Without these successes, I am likely to feel a total failure and worthless. I will probably fall into this pit more than once a years -- self-knowledge.

one-long-job resume can be bad when you change career
I always felt my job-hopper resume is a liability, but west coast shops don't care
