my java AND c++ QQ is good but some interviewers will not be impressed. I think this happens to other strong candidates.

I call it "don't like your face", but there are various reasons. 

They may feel your understanding on some topics is imprecise or not quite right.

They may feel your are too confident, even arrogant.

I used to feel I ought to "plowback" for zbs and GTD, not only for IV. Now after working for 20 years, I now believe ANY tech knowledge, accu, deepening/stack-up ... has no leverage and basically worthless if not relevant to IV. 
* GTD skills? dominated by localSys. Tool knowledge can help but localSys is 10x more imporant.
* BestPractice design? Almost never mattered in my career. After EMPWorld, I have never risen to decision-maker level.
* BestPractice implementation? mostly a matter of personal preference by the manager
* zbs? Consider the classic books like [[Pearls]]. If not relevant to IV then this zbs is only for self-satisfaction

This is one reason why I lost steam in Singapore. My NY years were filled with self improvement driven by interviews.
--new blogpost: delights: strategic, engaged
[tags t_othRisk]
I feel my expectation was invariably too high in terms of strategic value, therefore underwhelming. (engagement ... expectation was moderately too high) Against this backgrop, there are little delights, but stigma/respect (not salary!) was too huge as a factor and overshadowed those little delights. For a perspective, please look at the spreadsheet "predict next 3-5Y job satisfaction"

I chose a python job at Macq .. engaged for a few months and never disengaged, to my delight
I chose the c++ job at RTS .. engaged for 6 months, and never disengaged, to my delight. 
* Reason: traction in interviews and also in GTD and zbs
* Reason: interviews
* Reason: socket QQ was in-demand
* Reason: QQ discussions with colleagues .. visible progress

Both job decisions produced good/superior leverage over 5Y.

I chose a c# job ... engaged for a year and then disengaged, shorter than expected. Leverage was good.
--new?
my tsn ambition/dream is largely constrained by risks:
* stigma/respect
* figure things out faster than colleagues

For these specific risks, my current risk tolerance is higher so I ought to be bolder.

Note these risks exist with/out tsn. If we want to minimize these risks we need to find a low-calibre team like RTS, or OC (95G?)

--new blogpost: c#^java/c++ journeys
my c# xx journey was exciting for a year but .. In contrast, my core-java/c++ (not jxee) journey has generated superior ROTI because 
* the interview topics are stable 
* I was able to stick to these career directions

However, most of the java5 new features are out of fashion in interviews. How about j8 features?

leverage? c# is lower but not bad. See separate blogpost
--coding drill for indeed:
small problems using lot of python data structures
fuxi python blog posts
list comp
define classes with fields
combine multiple lines to 1
triple quote comments

--since 2007, very few examples of "effort->ROTI" including financial ROTI
(vague, not worth publishing)
* c++/C#/java IV pass rate
* pure algo IV pass rate
* online timed coding IV pass rate
* passive income growing including Energy12
* diet
--new or update: long-term orgro=elusive
long-term orgro is elusive. Biggest success I can think of is c++ (thanks to lots of IV) but in terms of salary increasae, I can't think of any... perhaps quant dev

swing -- rare engagement + orgro but abandoned !

c# -- i made sacrifices for deep-dive, and in return experienced rare engagement + orgro. I have since given up the direction, as c# is not so relevant to my current direction.

--no blogpost: I actually felt good receiving low salary offers like Nasdaq and NCS
Somehow it confirms my value-add to the economy, my "health condition"
