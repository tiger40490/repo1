--3 reasons this hibernation phase is so much better than last time
* not fixated on inferiority. at age 38 I was still feeling at peak and hence ... struggling against and missing the expectations repeatedly (boxer taking a brutal beating). Now at age 45 my self-expectations match reality way better

* java job -- not aiming to tackle tough tech domains like c++ or quant. Job is easier than Macq and Qz. so far no PIP risk

* boy's academics -- not taken up as my burden

I grossly underestimated the impact of PIP, damaged goods, stigma, 

--I still want to do c++. If I do a gr8 job in this java team, I might get a chance to take on some c++ work.

Recall the CG/velocity projects I might have some advantages as those guys aren't superstars.
