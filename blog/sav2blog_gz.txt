--new: expectation@older techie: big problem with SG 
On wall st, older techies are accepted as nothing special. 

In SG, I am usually viewed as a senior leadership candidate.

This is one of the fundamental fault lines in my SG career path.

perhaps the big picture insight (Josh, Rahul) is equally imp as the Local localSys, but i still feel figure-out speed is my real weakness.

---- 3deeper mtv2work4more$ after basic ffree
* light-duty, semi-retirement jobs providing more free time (mostly for self-learning, blogging). This is indeed a $-motivation because with more financial resources, I can afford to take such jobs at lower pay. In fact, I did pursue this route in my 2019 SG job search.
* more days with grandparents -- need more unpaid leaves or work in BJ home
* more respect, from colleagues or myself

-- now some motivations not so deep
* better home location (not size) -- clean streets; shorter commute; reasonable school.. Eg Bayonne, JC

-- Now some 2ndary items
* more time with kids? Outside top 5 motivations.
* better (healthy) food? usually I can find cheaper alternatives 
* workout classes? Usually not expensive

--what i look forward to over 6M
first earn the respect...
Am not really ambitious, so I will take more time off with family, possibly overseas trip to Penang, Thailand, Taiwan
