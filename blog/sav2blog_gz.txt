--Within a month, You can often predict a worker's long-term attitude?

On this job I feel I would continue to show commitment (to deadlines), dedication (not so much distraction), sense of urgency ..

How about mvea job?
 
Q: why I feel more dedicated (and motivated) on this job compared to earlier jobs?

* colleagues are less dedicated
* sense of urgency
* I feel I could exceed mgr expectation with 90% effort

--tech xx used to be my biggest "burn", bigger than workout, quant, ...
I used to focus not only on QQ, but also zbs, and even localSys
Now the roti of tech xx is much lower than before.
--3 reasons this hibernation phase is so much better than qSG phase
othRisk?

* not fixated on inferiority. at age 38 I was still feeling at peak and hence ... struggling against and missing the expectations repeatedly (boxer taking a brutal beating). Now at age 45 my self-expectations match reality way better
* mlp job -- not aiming to tackle tough tech domains like c++ or quant. Boss expectation is easier than Macq and Qz. so far no PIP risk
* not aiming to "upgrade" my son's academics

In hindsight, I grossly underestimated the impact of PIP, damaged goods, stigma, 

--beware of oth
Using words and numbers, am trying to "capture" my perceptions (intuitions, observations and hopefully a bit of insights) of the c++/java job market trends. There's some reality out there but each person including the expert has only a limited view of that reality, based on limited data.

Those numbers look impressive, but actually similar to the words -- they are mostly personal perceptions dressed up as objective measurements.

If you don't use words or numbers then you can't capture any observation of the "reality". Your impression of that reality (without words you can't even refer to that reality) remains hopelessly vague. I now believe vague is the lowest level of comprehension, usually as bad as a biased comprehension. Using words+numbers we have a chance to improve our perception.

my perceptions shape my decisions, and my decisions affect my family's life chances.

my perceptions shape my selective listening. Gradually, actively, my selective listening would modify my "membrane"! All great thinkers, writers update their membrane.

Am basically analyzing my perception of the reality, but that's the best I could do. I'm good at analyzing myself as an object.

Refusing to plan because of high uncertainty is lazy, is pessimistic, is doomed.

--I like the PIP abbr as it is shorter and well-defined outside my own nomenclature
