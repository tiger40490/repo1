What part of coding drill is worst on my absorbency?
coding is worst. It drains my laser energy fastest. I think frustration is the key. Expectation and self-image create the frustration and the drain. 
pure algo on paper is lighter. No ECT so I am swift and efficient
SDI is most fun, least boring.

my tsn ambition/dream is largely constrained by risks:
* stigma/respect
* figure things out faster than colleagues

For these specific risks, my current risk tolerance is higher so I ought to be bolder.

Note these risks exist with/out tsn. If we want to minimize these risks we need to find a low-calibre team like RTS, or OC (95G?)

--new blogpost: java perf^simplicity
Paradoxically
java's syntax simplicity is on par with python, better than c# and much better than c++.
java's performance is on par with c# and c++, largely due to JVM and JIT

java has been popular on web servers, and crucially the newer mobile, cloud, big-data platforms, beating c++, c#, python

java's adoption rate as a foundation platform or integration-target... is better than other languages. Many products are built for java, on java or with java in mind. I'm deliberately vague here because I don't want to spend too much time analyzing this vague, general observation.

tags t_churn
My thick->thin insight into c#, SQL, swing, quant ... are not needed at present. Future? How about my current heavy t-investment in socket, TMP, c++11, python ...?

Focus today is ROTI, NOT about churn. Socket, SQL, core c++ are actually the best-performing tech bets in terms of robust demand and shelf-life. 

If you stay within core java (like XR and many friends), then you don't need to learn these other skills, but are they better off now?

even a quick rewrite (not inventing) on a simple problem like removingSpaces can benefit my coding speed, syntax, ECT

perhaps it's better to do some practice every other day rather than planning to do something strenuous once a week because many things can derail the weekly "exercise"

if I were a mgr like Miao in a bank, I would feel ..

my value-add is tied to this firm and not portable compared to a techie

I got to this position by building local relationships, learning the localSys and local workflow
.. so it's hard to be confident about repeating the same at another firm
competitive pressure from younger managers

my java AND c++ QQ is good but some interviewers will not be impressed. I think this happens to other strong candidates.

I call it "don't like your face", but there are various reasons. 

They may feel your understanding on some topics is imprecise or not quite right.

They may feel your are too confident, even arrogant. 
--new blogpost:
I used to feel I ought to "plowback" for zbs and GTD, not only for IV. Now after working for 20 years, I now believe ANY tech knowledge, accu, deepening/stack-up ... has no leverage and basically worthless if not relevant to IV. 
* GTD skills? dominated by localSys. Tool knowledge can help but localSys is 10x more imporant.
* BestPractice design? Almost never mattered in my career. After EMPWorld, I have never risen to decision-maker level.
* BestPractice implementation? mostly a matter of personal preference by the manager
* zbs? Consider the classic books like [[Pearls]]. If not relevant to IV then this zbs is only for self-satisfaction

This is one reason why I lost steam in Singapore. My NY years were filled with self improvement driven by interviews.
--new blogpost: delights: strategic, engaged
[tags t_othRisk]
I feel my expectation was invariably too high in terms of strategic value, therefore underwhelming. (engagement ... expectation was moderately too high) Against this backgrop, there are little delights, but stigma/respect (not salary!) was too huge as a factor and overshadowed those little delights. For a perspective, please look at the spreadsheet "predict next 3-5Y job satisfaction"

I chose a python job at Macq .. engaged for a few months and never disengaged, to my delight
I chose the c++ job at RTS .. engaged for 6 months, and never disengaged, to my delight. 
* Reason: traction in interviews and also in GTD and zbs
* Reason: interviews
* Reason: socket QQ was in-demand
* Reason: QQ discussions with colleagues .. visible progress

Both job decisions produced good/superior leverage over 5Y.

I chose a c# job ... engaged for a year and then disengaged, shorter than expected. Leverage was good.
--new blogpost: c#^java/c++ journeys
my c# xx journey was exciting for a year but .. In contrast, my core-java/c++ (not jxee) journey has generated superior ROTI because 
* the interview topics are stable 
* I was able to stick to these career directions

However, most of the java5 new features are out of fashion in interviews. How about j8 features?

leverage? c# is lower but not bad. See separate blogpost

--new or update: long-term orgro=elusive
long-term orgro is elusive. Biggest success I can think of is c++ (thanks to lots of IV) but in terms of salary increasae, I can't think of any... perhaps quant dev

swing -- rare engagement + orgro but abandoned !

c# -- i made sacrifices for deep-dive, and in return experienced rare engagement + orgro. I have since given up the direction, as c# is not so relevant to my current direction.

--no blogpost: I actually felt good receiving low salary offers like Nasdaq and NCS
Somehow it confirms my value-add to the economy, my "health condition"
