unlike many new joiners, I don't have serious impostor's syndrome. I am open about my weaknesses and strengths.
--
I want to be seen as dedicated, motivated, ..

--
now i feel my age helps me lower their expectations, at least in my own opinion.
--
lucky that Larry is not so pushy, aggressive, 
--
i feel good about my focus and my strength to resist the temptations. I hope this becomes a positive feedback loop of respect/confidence/self-esteem even without faster progress

I think bosses like Josh would notice the effort even if without impressive progress.

--nothing new. integrate with t_focus@GTD and the 'timeMgmt' category in open blog
my time at home is limited:
* household chores -- leave to maid if possible
* time for family esp. boy
* non-tech blogging+emailing is a huge contender
* tech xx including QQ, zbs, coding ... i would probably give up.
* GTD (wfh) -- capture the mood if possible

My hours in office are scarce :
* tech xx including QQ -- need to cut further. Might be tough and need optimization
* GTD -- camp out if in the mood
* localSys explore -- for long term productivity etc
* frequent breaks

---- 3deeper mtv2work4more$ after basic ffree
light-duty, semi-retirement jobs providing more free time (mostly for self-learning, blogging). This is indeed a $-motivation because with more financial resources, I can afford to take such jobs at lower pay. In fact, I did pursue this route in my 2019 SG job search.
more days with grandparents -- need more unpaid leaves
-- now some motivations not so deep
better home location (not size) -- clean streets; shorter commute; reasonable school.. Eg Bayonne, JC
-- Now some 2ndary items
more time with kids? Outside top 5.
better (healthy) food? usually I can find cheaper alternatives 
workout classes? Usually not expensive
--what i look forward to over 6M
first earn the respect...
Am not really ambitious, so I will take more time off with family, possibly overseas trip to Penang, Thailand, Taiwan
----

--focus during office hours
reduce casual browsing ... online banking etc. snowball risk.
also warehouse the curiosity searching until some designated defocus time.

--sugg: volunteer to take up prod issues selectively. Dig a bit on my own. Aim at connecting the dots and becoming independent with some part of the codebase.  Avoid "lossy learning"

However, some may say I'm exploring beyond the necessary. I think my learning style is slightly different, so i want to strike a balance
* some exploration about the localSys aimed at long term GTD
* not too much time wasted.

I think the income-orientation will be bad for my motivation. I need some intrinsic motivation.
--update blogpost on coding drill in SG
Paradox: in US I had real motivation/absorbency/.. to keep up coding drill. But in SG I don't feel I will have even 5% of that.

--no blog but deep impact
As soon as we start to work towards better salary , we are on a slippery slope. 
We may feel we are on a reasonable ground, with a reasonable goal, but down the slope there is irrationality, desperation, greed, self-hate, inferiority...
we tend to keep up with the Jones's. Many people compare with the wrong peer group .. including the web2.0 shops
We tend to neglect many valuable things that at end of our lives we would recognize as more important than the rat race

One of the jolting, awakening (一盆凉水) questions is -- Granted other people earn a lot more, but i don't need that much money to live a comfortable life, so why do I feel inadequate so often?

I told many friends that I work hard to prepare for interviews but I am Very selective about where to join. 
I focus mostly on the salary level in the WallSt contract market, not the perm salaries. 
This kind of attitude is one small step towards a more rational, more pragmatic perception of the rat race

--new: conclusions on my mvea era # i keep it in gitblog for commute. Not ready for publish

* Not much positive feedback beside 'providing new, different viewpoints', but Josh doesn't give positive feedback anyway
* should be able to come back to MS
* Josh might remember Victor as more suitable for greenfield projects.
* I think Josh liked me as a person and understands my priorities
* I didn't get the so-called "big picture" that Josh probably valued. Therefore I was unable to "support the floor" when team is out. The last time I was able to happened in GS.
* A few times I worked hard and made personal sacrifices. Josh noticed.
* In the final month, I see myself as fairly efficient to wrap up my final projects 
* Q: was the mvea c++ codebase too big for me? No, given my projects are always localized.

I had a few proud deliveries where I had some impetus to capture the momentum (camp out). 
I think colleagues were impressed to some extent even though other people probably achieved more. Well, I don't need to compare with those and feel belittled. 
This analysis revealed that Josh is not easily impressed. 
Perhaps he has high standard as he didn't praise Rahul either.

* I identified two stateless calc engines in pspc. Seeing the elegant simplicity in the design, I quickly zoom in, stepped over and documented the internal logic and replicated it in spreadsheet.
* my pspc avg price sheet successfully replicated a prod "issue", shedding light into a hitherto murky part of the codebase
* I quickly figure out the serialization root cause of the outage
* I had two brave attempts to introduce my QOT innovation
* My 5.1 Brazil pspc project was the biggest config project to date. I single-handedly I overcame many compilation (gm-install) and startup errors.

--QQ=fake;zbs_learning=treacherous
I used to feel my QQ knowledge was not zbs but now I think many interviewers ask zbs questions. zbs is a vague concept. QQ has a well-established range of topics. Experts sizing up each other ... is mostly QQ

Biggest danger with zbs -- when I spend my precious spare time on zbs not aimed at QQ, I inevitably regret. Without QQ, the learning lacks reinforcement, positive feedback loop... and fades from memory. 
I think in SG context the lack of interviews make zbs learning treacherous

Therefore, zbs learning must aim at xref and thick->thin.

? One guy with theoretical zbs (either strong or poor QQ) may be very mediocre joining a new team. It depends on the key skill needed in the team. Is it localSys, design ...? 

--new blogpost?
sometimes I tell myself "if I commit myself I could do well in a job and move up and stay beyond 2Y." ... Largely romanticizing. It has not happened and unlikely to happen. Key reasons

* my immigration plan
* contract job? Not really a obstacle, as conversion to perm is always possible
* for perm jobs, after 12M I tend to receive neg reviews, partly due to benchmarking. No benchmarking for contractors
* My cash-flow is positive and I can afford to change to lower jobs, unlike some peers.
* Nowadays, annual job hopping is not so uncommon as programmers are a hot commodity. (Still, as I age, I avoid that and try to stay for 2Y+)
