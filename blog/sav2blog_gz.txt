unlike many new joiners, I don't have serious impostor's syndrome. I am open about my weaknesses and strengths.

---- 3deeper mtv2work4more$ after basic ffree
light-duty, semi-retirement jobs providing more free time (mostly for self-learning, blogging). This is indeed a $-motivation because with more financial resources, I can afford to take such jobs at lower pay. In fact, I did pursue this route in my 2019 SG job search.
more days with grandparents -- need more unpaid leaves
-- now some motivations not so deep
better home location (not size) -- clean streets; shorter commute; reasonable school.. Eg Bayonne, JC
-- Now some 2ndary items
more time with kids? Outside top 5.
better (healthy) food? usually I can find cheaper alternatives 
workout classes? Usually not expensive
--what i look forward to over 6M
first earn the respect...
Am not really ambitious, so I will take more time off with family, possibly overseas trip to Penang, Thailand, Taiwan
----

--focus during office hours
reduce casual browsing ... online banking etc. snowball risk.
also warehouse the curiosity searching until some designated defocus time.

--sugg: volunteer to take up prod issues selectively. Dig a bit on my own. Aim at connecting the dots and becoming independent with some part of the codebase.  Avoid "lossy learning"

However, some may say I'm exploring beyond the necessary. I think my learning style is slightly different, so i want to strike a balance
* some exploration about the localSys aimed at long term GTD
* not too much time wasted.

I think the income-orientation will be bad for my motivation. I need some intrinsic motivation.
--update blogpost on coding drill in SG
Paradox: in US I had real motivation/absorbency/.. to keep up coding drill. But in SG I don't feel I will have even 5% of that.

--no blog but deep impact
As soon as we start to work towards better salary , we are on a slippery slope. 
We may feel we are on a reasonable ground, with a reasonable goal, but down the slope there is irrationality, desperation, greed, self-hate, inferiority...
we tend to keep up with the Jones's. Many people compare with the wrong peer group .. including the web2.0 shops
We tend to neglect many valuable things that at end of our lives we would recognize as more important than the rat race

One of the jolting, awakening (一盆凉水) questions is -- Granted other people earn a lot more, but i don't need that much money to live a comfortable life, so why do I feel inadequate so often?

I told many friends that I work hard to prepare for interviews but I am Very selective about where to join. 
I focus mostly on the salary level in the WallSt contract market, not the perm salaries. 
This kind of attitude is one small step towards a more rational, more pragmatic perception of the rat race


--QQ=fake;zbs_learning=treacherous
I used to feel my QQ knowledge was not zbs but now I think many interviewers ask zbs questions. zbs is a vague concept. QQ has a well-established range of topics. Experts sizing up each other ... is mostly QQ

Biggest danger with zbs -- when I spend my precious spare time on zbs not aimed at QQ, I inevitably regret. Without QQ, the learning lacks reinforcement, positive feedback loop... and fades from memory. 
I think in SG context the lack of interviews make zbs learning treacherous

Therefore, zbs learning must aim at xref and thick->thin.

? One guy with theoretical zbs (either strong or poor QQ) may be very mediocre joining a new team. It depends on the key skill needed in the team. Is it localSys, design ...? 

--new blogpost?
sometimes I tell myself "if I commit myself I could do well in a job and move up and stay beyond 2Y." ... Largely romanticizing. It has not happened and unlikely to happen. Key reasons

* my immigration plan
* contract job? Not really a obstacle, as conversion to perm is always possible
* for perm jobs, after 12M I tend to receive neg reviews, partly due to benchmarking. No benchmarking for contractors
* My cash-flow is positive and I can afford to change to lower jobs, unlike some peers.
* Nowadays, annual job hopping is not so uncommon as programmers are a hot commodity. (Still, as I age, I avoid that and try to stay for 2Y+)
