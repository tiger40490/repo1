--new: taking up large codebase
In a few cases, within 3M I was able to "take up" a sizable brown field codebase and become somewhat productive. As I told Kyle, I don't need bottom-up in-depth knowledge to be competent. 

In terms of count, I had more successes taking up sizable brown-field codebase than an old-timer has
* eg: Guardian -- don't belittle the challenge and complexity
* eg: mvea c++
* eg: mtg comm, integrated into a huge codebase
* eg: StirtRisk personalization -- I made it work and manager was impressed
* eg: StirtRisk bug fixes on GUI
* eg: zed Billing Mediator
* -- the obvious success stories
* eg: AICE -- huge stored proc
* eg: Quest app owner
* eg: error memos
* eg: RTS

--new blogpost?
sometimes I tell myself "if I commit myself I could do well in a job and move up and stay beyond 2Y." ... Largely romanticizing. It has not happened and unlikely to happen. Key reasons

* my immigration plan
* contract job? Not really a obstacle, as conversion to perm is always possible
* for perm jobs, after 12M I tend to receive neg reviews, partly due to benchmarking. No benchmarking for contractors
* My cash-flow is positive and I can afford to change to lower jobs, unlike some peers.
* Nowadays, annual job hopping is not so uncommon as programmers are a hot commodity. (Still, as I age, I avoid that and try to stay for 2Y+)

--Retire at Google?
CSDoctor thinks it's possible but I doubt it
However CSDoctor questions himself "To present myself as a team lead or architect, what do I have to offer them?"

--paradox: if I feel basically semi-retired on my rental income, why do I envy those with higher income?

I feel I'm able to feel OK with conserver lifestyle, but my family members would not feel so comfortable. See my blog on deprivation.

Pattern: 
Suddenly I happen to notice a few "peers" getting ahead in terms of salary ... and I get hit by the same inferiority complex as before.
Actually, people 10 years younger are not my peers
Actually, the manager types aren't my peers, as grandpa pointed out repeatedly.

Q: what do I treasure more? I don't really need the 20% extra income. 
A: easy life -- PIP, stigma .. are real risks in my career.
A: beautiful wife
A: SG citizenship
A: wellness
A: cash flow freedom over 20Y or till end of my life
A: robust career. Their careers may not be so robust if you look closely

--new? stay]shape4CIV+QQ till 50
I would say QQ is my stronger arm, even though the HFT shops may dismiss it.
QQ benefits from thick->thin (and xRef) ... one of the key competitive advantages I could develop through blogging and continuous refresh

High-end CIV is only needed at top west-coast shops, not my realistic target. I think most of the top performers are young

sg job market remains as slow and thin as before. Still financial jobs constitute 90% of my job pool
JC has more suitable jobs than SG has including start-up.

Singapore non-finance companies simply can't afford because the main street dev salary is much lower than U.S.

The wall st salary level is largely influenced by west coast and also main street dev salary. No such influence in SG

--no blog
I told Rahul that I need to be independent to capture the engagement, but that's short term.

Over long term, what do I need to survive and thrive?
* sustained focus on localSys
* respect/appreciation
* not boxed into some unfavorable technology like high-churn 

--fuxi
Like Black developers .. As an older Singaporean developer I also have higher visibility.
IFF I apply myself (localSys) and establish a foundation at a new site as Piroz does, I think I could survive and possibly show my hidden strengths.

However, at Stirt I was unable to outshine other guys.

At Macq, I was unable to impress bosses.

the IV successes define me.
Without these successes, I am likely to feel a total failure and worthless. I will probably fall into this pit more than once a years -- self-knowledge.
