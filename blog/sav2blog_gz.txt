I have achieved basic ffree. So my peerComp pain is like the rich feeling outpaced by a tycoon... endless greed, mindless peer comparison.

The tendency to compare to our neighbors is ... a basic human tendency, like envy. Even a child can experience that. However, it takes a rational mind (wisdom) to control the tendency.

--Within a month, You can often predict a worker's long-term attitude?
On this job I feel I would continue to show commitment (to deadlines), dedication (not so much distraction), sense of urgency ..

How about mvea job?
 
Q: why I feel more dedicated (and motivated) on this job compared to earlier jobs?

* colleagues are less dedicated, but same at OC
* a small but growing sense of urgency
* I feel I could exceed mgr expectation with 90% effort

Majority of the effective, efficient, productive tech professionals don't work long hours because they already earn enough. Some of them can retire if they want to.

Some percentage of them quit a big company or a high position, sometimes to join a startup. One of the reasons -- already earned enough.

Most of them value work-life balance. Half of them put the value not in words but in action.

Many of them still choose to work hard because they love what they do, or want to achieve more, not because no-choice.

Using words and numbers, am trying to "capture" my perceptions (intuitions, observations and hopefully a bit of insights) of the c++/java job market trends. There's some reality out there but each person including the expert has only a limited view of that reality, based on limited data.

Those numbers look impressive, but actually similar to the words -- they are mostly personal perceptions dressed up as objective measurements.

If you don't use words or numbers then you can't capture any observation of the "reality". Your impression of that reality (without words you can't even refer to that reality) remains hopelessly vague. I now believe vague is the lowest level of comprehension, usually as bad as a biased comprehension. Using words+numbers we have a chance to improve our perception.

my perceptions shape my decisions, and my decisions affect my family's life chances.

my perceptions shape my selective listening. Gradually, actively, my selective listening would modify my "membrane"! All great thinkers, writers update their membrane.

Am basically analyzing my perception of the reality, but that's the best I could do. I'm good at analyzing myself as an object.

Refusing to plan because of high uncertainty is lazy, is pessimistic, is doomed.
