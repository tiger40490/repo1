the xx in weekend coding assignments are different from coding drill or work projects
* intensity -- highest
* scale -- larger than coding drill but not too large like work projects
* BP -- is a major learning focus and evaluation criteria

--update blogpost on macq .. (tough judge? bonus pool?)
the PIP cast a long shadow and left a deep scar. Am still recovering. This scar is deeper than Stirt case.

Remember the abused children, who grew up traumatized? I was not traumatized as a kid. My traumatic experience is still damaging but I can handle it. I have the maturity to handle it.

Adults are often traumatized by failed marriage, in-law conflicts,

in west coast IV, I have no "unfair advantage" as the employers are open to all. 
In contrast, On Wall St, I have an unfair advantage in the form of
* accumulated IV xp
* accumulated dnlg
* track record

--new: what can derail work-till-75 plan
I think health is unlikely to be the reason. IV competition, age discrimination are more likely.

On the job, my energy, absorbency and sustained focus might go down or up with age.
I wrote more in another blogpost -- As I age, brown-field localSys will become harder to absorb. I may need to stay at one system longer.

On the other hand, if offered the chance to convert from contractor to FTE, I may need to resist and possibly move out.

I think my QQ knowledge will remain competitive.

Based on the rumor that west coast is more competitive and age-unfriendly, then the techies there in their 40's can't afford to remain hands-on like on Wall st. If confirmed, then Wall st is better for older programmers.

In fact, beside doctors, Wall St tech might be one of the most eviable domains for work-till-70. Note tech also includes BAU and other support functions.

--new: commercial banks like FX not eq|comm

FX is closer to the everyday business of commercial banks. The biggest FX banks are usually commercial banks -- DB, Barclays, Citi, never ibanks.

FI is a composite market. Some FI products are closer to commercial banks. I think commercial banks buy-n-hold soverein bonds (not traded) similar to insurers do.
--aging -- localSys (esp. learning large codebase) ... is taxing on the aging memory. 
I *guess* GregM (RTS) might be a cautionary tale. 
He relied on his theoretical knowledge to get a job, but not fast enough with local codebase

Is green field better than brown-field codebase? I guess so. Brown-field projects are rarely given to a new joiner but consider 95G and volFitter !

Now consider this seprate question: 
Q: Are the c++11 QQ topics a form of churn on the interview competition?
A: I feel the worst scene is localSys on the job. c++11 QQ is lighter.

Q: how about the Coding IV? still lighter stress than localSys. I can take my time.
--new: set up to fail #Nsdq HR
The HR professionals at Barclays Singapore and Nsdq failed to persuade me to accept their offers. They probably feel inferior, inadequate, failed, self-pity. The Nsdq guy was already on his way out, so this could be a double-whammy, reinforcing an false perception.

However, the reality is, I was not the right candidate to persuade. The self-pity is mis-directed and groundless.

Now look at my PIP at Macq and Qz. I worked hard towards the expectation but it could be the wrong target for me. I was set up to fail.

--update blogpost
Q: was the initial 6M ramp-up at Macq effective for localSys, GTD?
A: It helped. Key is capture of absorbency and engagement. I didn't have a lot to capture :(

Since I don't need to worry so much about cash flow .. close to ffree, what jobs would I enjoy? 
Perhaps look at jobSatisfactionPredictor?

* impact? Not really important to me
* OC type of easy job with plenty of spare time?
* domain: devops?
* domain: quant dev, with low churn? 
* domain: inet? impactful but high-churn... not more enjoyable than my recent jobs
* domain: mkt data? impactful, low churn but not more enjoyable than other jobs
* mvea type of job
* RTS type of job -- familiar routine
* MLP type of job -- challenging... provided I can live in peace with PIP

See also the pleasure^chore framework

Unbelievably, QQ study feels like "burning" pleasure to me. After I complete some chore  like coding drill, tax, I long for some QQ study !

There are very few burning pleasures:
* tech study including zbs, halo...
* jogging in stadium
* learning Oracle

--Given the high churn in UI space, are interviewers more lenient?

--update blog ... csy:
the IV successes define me.
Without these successes, I am likely to feel a total failure and worthless, probably more than once a years -- self-knowledge.

(am still negative about next job) 
Q: is colleague relationship a potential problem?
A: yes but based on experience, boss relationship is more likely. Even more likely is coworker benchmark on localSys -- if I'm fast at figure-out, then I hope to feel proud (Macq, Qz, OC included) even if stigmatized by PIP.

java - exceeding my expectations in the churn. Found 2nd life in web2.0
c# - underwhelming. Displaced in web2.0. Google CIV uses 5 anguages, without c#
c++ - matching my expectation. slow decline. Efficiency advantage is eclipsed by java and some new languages
py - exceeding my expectation
javascript - exceeding expectation

--no blogpost: delights: engaged,leverage,strategic.. 
[tags t_othRisk]
I feel my expectation was invariably too high in terms of strategic value, leverage and ROTI, therefore underwhelming. 
(engagement ... expectation was moderately too high) 
Against this backdrop, there are little delights, but stigma/respect (not salary!) was too huge as a factor and overshadowed those little delights. For a perspective, please look at the spreadsheet "predict next 3-5Y job satisfaction"

I chose a python job at Macq .. engaged for a few months, to my delight
I chose the c++ job at RTS .. engaged for 6 months, to my delight. 
* Reason: traction in interviews and also in GTD and zbs
* Reason: interviews
* Reason: socket QQ was in-demand
* Reason: QQ discussions with colleagues .. visible progress

Both job decisions produced good/superior leverage over 5Y.

I chose a c# job ... engaged for a year and then disengaged, shorter than expected. Leverage was good.

I chose a Quant dev job ... engaged for a year and never disengaged. Leverage was underwhelming.

I chose a c++ large scale eq OMS job ... engaged for a few months. Leverage is unknown

--no blogpost: c#^java/c++ journeys
[tags t_below7]
my c# xx journey was exciting for 6M before OC and in first year in OC. In contrast, my core-java/c++ (less for jxee) journeys have generated superior ROTI (elusive) because 
* the interview topics are stable 
* market waves steered me to stick to (not abandon) these career directions

leverage? c# is lower but not bad. See separate blogpost

For all languages, there is no hike, no strategic value so at that level all underwhelming

Like Black developers .. As an older developer I also have higher visibility.
IFF I apply myself (localSys) and establish a foundation at a new site as Piroz does, I think I could survive and possibly show my hidden strengths.
