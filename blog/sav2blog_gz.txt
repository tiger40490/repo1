unlike many new joiners, I don't have impostor's syndrome. I know my weaknesses and strengths

--what i look forward to
first earn the respect...
Am not really ambitious, so I will take more time off with family, possibly overseas trip to Penang, Thailand, Taiwan
--focus during office hours
reduce casual browsing ... online banking etc. snowball risk.
also warehouse the curiosity search until some designated defocus time.

--sugg: volunteer to take up prod issues selectively. Dig a bit on my own. Aim at connecting the dots and becoming independent with some part of the codebase.  Avoid "lossy learning"

However, some may say I'm exploring beyond the necessary. I think my learning style is slightly different, so i want to strike a balance
* some exploration about the localSys aimed at long term GTD
* not too much time wasted.

I think the income-orientation will be bad for my motivation. I need some intrinsic motivation.
--update blogpost on coding drill in SG
Paradox: in US I had real motivation/absorbency/.. to keep up coding drill. But i don't feel I will have even 5% of that in SG.

--no blog
As soon as we start to work towards better salary , we are on a slippery slope. 
We may feel we are on a reasonable ground, with a reasonable goal, but down the slope there is irrationality, despair, desperation, greed, self-hate, inferiority...
we tend to keep up with the Jones's. Many people compare with the wrong peer group ..
We tend to neglect many valuable things that at end of our lives we would recognize as more important than the rat race

One of the jolting, awakening (一盆凉水) questions is -- Granted other people earn a lot more, but i don't need that much money to live a comfortable life, so why do I feel inadequate so often?

I told many friends that I work hard to prepare for interviews but I am Very selective about where to join. 
I focus mostly on the salary level in the WallSt contract market, not the perm salaries. 
This kind of attitude is one small step towards a more rational, more pragmatic perception of the rat race

--nothing new. integrate with t_focus@GTD and the 'timeMgmt' category in open blog
my time at home is limited:
* household chores -- leave to maid if possible
* time for family esp. boy
* non-tech blogging+emailing is a huge contender
* tech xx including QQ, zbs, coding
* GTD (wfh) -- capture the mood if possible

My hours in office are scarce :
* tech xx including QQ -- need to cut further. Might be tough and need optimization
* GTD -- camp out if in the mood
* localSys explore -- for long term productivity etc
* frequent breaks

--QQ=fake;zbs_learning=treacherous
I used to feel my QQ knowledge was not zbs but now I think many interviewers ask zbs questions. zbs is a vague concept. QQ has a well-established range of topics. Experts sizing up each other ... is mostly QQ

Biggest danger with zbs -- when I spend my precious spare time on zbs not aimed at QQ, I inevitably regret. Without QQ, the learning lacks reinforcement, positive feedback loop... and fades from memory. 
I think in SG context the lack of interviews make zbs learning treacherous

Therefore, zbs learning must aim at xref and thick->thin.

? One guy with theoretical zbs (either strong or poor QQ) may be very mediocre joining a new team. It depends on the key skill needed in the team. Is it localSys, design ...? 

--new blogpost?
sometimes I tell myself "if I commit myself I could do well in a job and move up and stay beyond 2Y." ... Largely romanticizing. It has not happened and unlikely to happen. Key reasons

* my immigration plan
* contract job? Not really a obstacle, as conversion to perm is always possible
* for perm jobs, after 12M I tend to receive neg reviews, partly due to benchmarking. No benchmarking for contractors
* My cash-flow is positive and I can afford to change to lower jobs, unlike some peers.
* Nowadays, annual job hopping is not so uncommon as programmers are a hot commodity. (Still, as I age, I avoid that and try to stay for 2Y+)
