bigO is really QQ topic, my strength

--new: stay]shape4CIV+QQ till50?
I would say QQ is my stronger arm, even though the HFT shops may dismiss it.
QQ benefits from thick->thin (and xRef) ... one of the key competitive advantages I could develop through blogging and continuous refresh

High-end CIV is only needed at top west-coast shops, not my realistic target. I think most of the top performers are young

sg job market remains as slow and thin as before. Still financial jobs constitute 90% of my job pool
JC has more suitable jobs than SG has including start-up.

Singapore non-finance companies simply can't afford because the main street dev salary is much lower than U.S.

The wall st salary level is largely influenced by west coast and also main street dev salary.

Like Black developers .. As an older Singaporean developer I also have higher visibility.
IFF I apply myself (localSys) and establish a foundation at a new site as Piroz does, I think I could survive and possibly show my hidden strengths.

However, at Stirt I was unable to outshine other guys.

At Macq, I was unable to impress bosses.

the IV successes define me.
Without these successes, I am likely to feel a total failure and worthless. I will probably fall into this pit more than once a years -- self-knowledge.
