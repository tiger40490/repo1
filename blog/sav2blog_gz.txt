Which acid tests? qq topics or algo or other zbs topics (I tend to read in my spare time)?--update blogpost on c++tmp
C++TMP and rvr QQ may turn out similar to java bytecode engineering, reflection, generics, EJB (spent 6M) ...

Still better roti than Qz

Note TMP is more time-honored but less quizzed than rvr.

TMP is 
.needed when reaching next level in c++ zbs. Many new cpp features r added for TMP. I feel TMP is the main innovation thrust across c++ language n standard development. cpp lost many competitions but no other languages offer powerful TMP features.  
.seldom quizzed in QQ but sometimes you can showcase your Halo. 
.never needed in greenfield projects.  .Occasionally relevant in understanding existing code base

TMP is used with macros as both are compile time features.

Though CIV by definition ignores candidate experience level, the overall hiring process does NOT treat us same as a fresh grad. 

Fresh grads don't have Wall st senior dev job options. If they aren't good enough for the top tech shops, then they won't earn my salary.

When I was undergrad, I could solve many leetcode/hackerrank problems, with or without practice.

--update blogpost on survivor
I more than survived at Macq in first year, with a bonus
I did survive at Stirt by recovering from PIP and earning a meet/meet
--
I feel my sister and my son may be more effective. 
perhaps I have an adjustment problem -- frequently I outperform in IV to set up expectation, but on the job struggle to match it, and receive negative feedback. 
The problem is my reaction to the feedback. 
I feel I can do better. I can learn coping strategies. 
I can relax as grandpa suggested. 
I can live in peace with the negative feedback. 
If I put in a reasonable effort and manager accepts it without a bonus, then I feel I can be happy. 
If I put in a reasonable effort but manager clearly indicates "unacceptable", then I feel i would take action to leave

Overall, my reaction to PIP is weaker than my reaction to IV setbacks.

Traditionally, one of my strengths is positive attitude to IV setbacks.

It is easy to look at the gap and feel hopeless.

Parenting also requires this capacity. [[Learned optimism]]] listed Permanent as one hallmark of pessimists.

Since I don't need to worry so much about cash flow .. close to ffree, what jobs would I enjoy?
* impact? Not really important to me
* OC type of easy job with plenty of spare time?
* domain: devops?
* domain: quant dev, with low churn? 
* domain: inet? impactful but high-churn... not more enjoyable than my recent jobs
* domain: mkt data? impactful, low churn but not more enjoyable than other jobs

--new: job search SG still slower than NY
I didn't try the ibank jobs...
Singapore tech shops are mostly not keen about my profile
Singapore fintech shops ? no interest shown.
Singapore buy-sides are interested but kinda slow.

I must stop romanticizing

GregR told me the high-end python interviews were more selective than java interviews. I think the reason is same as west-coast coding interviews --

The high-end employers want to pay high salary only to qualified candidates.

--update blog ... csy:
the IV successes define me.
Without these successes, I am likely to feel a total failure and worthless, probably more than once a years -- self-knowledge.

java - exceeding my expectations in the churn. Found 2nd life in web2.0
c# - underwhelming. Displace in web2.0. Google CIV uses 5 anguages, without c#
c++ - matching my expectation. slow decline. Efficiency advantage is eclipsed by java and some new languages
py - exceeding my expectation
javascript - exceeding expectation

--update blogpost on ## self-esteem
Looks like every venture out of my tech sweet spot java/SQL/scripting... presents esteem-hazards (like health hazards) but dismal prospect in terms of self-esteem boost.

high-risk, low-return venture?

The health hazard is really nothing but one mgr's assessment. For my recent painful jobs, I continue to dismiss/ignore the possible boost to self-esteem --
* I conquered some of my biggest technology fears -- MSVS; c++ crash management; c++ large code navigation.. Other people may not agree, but my own experience proves that these challenges are harder than high-level dev (like web/scripting..). My fears were more deep-rooted.
* I built real mileage in c#. I even proved myself stronger than some c# veterans when I created a simple web server to dump log files for everyday troubleshooting.
* see more pointers in https://bintanvictor.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=27139&action=edit

--new blogpost: avoid hot domains that attract young competitors
I feel clearly less in-demand as I age. 
Perhaps I should shift towards domains that young guys avoid -- like c++/coreJava, back office, startups, lesser-known banks

telecom?

Even though Indeed hiring team claims to be language agnostic and don't care about your app domain, their architecture questions are gear towards web2.0 shops

There's a thinly veiled leaning towards java. 
If you use another language for your whiteboard, then you had better be very fast and sharp to defend your solution when it differs from the optimal java solution.

In reality, the solution you get using another language CAN be different from the optimal java solution.

When we watch a movie from Europe, India, Korea ... we can tell whether it has any international appeal or only limited local audience.

Similarly localSys knowledge has value only within a single company. The expertise I demonstrate in job interviews are relevant across many sites.

Quoine probably designed a tcp feed for internet clients, but in the industry, multicast feed is more industrial-strength, more advanced, more practical. Such expertise is more in-demand 

--no blogpost: delights: engaged,leverage,strategic.. 
[tags t_othRisk]
I feel my expectation was invariably too high in terms of strategic value, leverage and ROTI, therefore underwhelming. 
(engagement ... expectation was moderately too high) 
Against this backdrop, there are little delights, but stigma/respect (not salary!) was too huge as a factor and overshadowed those little delights. For a perspective, please look at the spreadsheet "predict next 3-5Y job satisfaction"

I chose a python job at Macq .. engaged for a few months, to my delight
I chose the c++ job at RTS .. engaged for 6 months, to my delight. 
* Reason: traction in interviews and also in GTD and zbs
* Reason: interviews
* Reason: socket QQ was in-demand
* Reason: QQ discussions with colleagues .. visible progress

Both job decisions produced good/superior leverage over 5Y.

I chose a c# job ... engaged for a year and then disengaged, shorter than expected. Leverage was good.

I chose a Quant dev job ... engaged for a year and never disengaged. Leverage was underwhelming.

I chose a c++ large scale eq OMS job ... engaged for a few months. Leverage is unknown

--no blogpost: c#^java/c++ journeys
[tags t_below7]
my c# xx journey was exciting for 6M before OC and in first year in OC. In contrast, my core-java/c++ (less for jxee) journeys have generated superior ROTI (elusive) because 
* the interview topics are stable 
* market waves steered me to stick to (not abandon) these career directions

leverage? c# is lower but not bad. See separate blogpost

For all languages, there is no hike, no strategic value so at that level all underwhelming
