--aging -- localSys (esp. learning large codebase) ... is taxing on the aging memory. 
I *guess* GregM (RTS) might be a cautionary tale. 
He relied on his theoretical knowledge to get a job, but not fast enough with local codebase

Is green field better than brown-field codebase? I guess so. Brown-field projects are rarely given to a new joiner but consider 95G and volFitter !

Now consider this separate question: 
Q: Are the c++11 QQ topics a form of churn on the interview competition?
A: I feel the worst scene is localSys on the job. c++11 QQ is lighter.

Q: how about the Coding IV? still lighter stress than localSys. I can take my time.

sg job market remains as slow and thin as before. Still financial jobs constitute 90% of my job pool
JC has more suitable jobs than SG has for me

--no blogpost:
Since I don't need to worry so much about cash flow .. close to ffree, what jobs would I enjoy? 
Perhaps look at jobSatisfactionPredictor?

* OC type of easy job with plenty of spare time?
* domain: devops?
* domain: inet? impactful but high-churn... not more enjoyable than my recent jobs
* domain: mkt data? impactful, low churn but not more enjoyable than other jobs
* mvea type of job
* RTS type of job -- familiar routine
* MLP type of job -- challenging... provided I can live in peace with PIP

--new: QQ study=burning pleasure
See also the pleasure^chore framework

Unbelievably, QQ study feels like "burning" pleasure to me. After I complete some chore  like coding drill, tax, I long for some QQ study !

There are very few burning pleasures:
* tech study including zbs, halo...
* jogging in stadium
* learning Oracle

--update blog ... csy:
the IV successes define me.
Without these successes, I am likely to feel a total failure and worthless. I will probably fall into this pit more than once a years -- self-knowledge.

java - exceeding my expectations in the churn. Found 2nd life in web2.0
c# - underwhelming. Displaced in web2.0. Google CIV uses 5 anguages, without c#
c++ - matching my expectation. slow decline. Efficiency advantage is eclipsed by java and some new languages
py - exceeding my expectation
javascript - exceeding expectation

--no blogpost: delights: engaged,leverage,strategic.. 
[tags t_othRisk]
I feel my expectation was invariably too high in terms of strategic value, leverage and ROTI, therefore underwhelming. 
(engagement ... expectation was moderately too high) 
Against this backdrop, there are little delights, but stigma/respect (not salary!) was too huge as a factor and overshadowed those little delights. For a perspective, please look at the spreadsheet "predict next 3-5Y job satisfaction"

I chose a python job at Macq .. engaged for a few months, to my delight
I chose the c++ job at RTS .. engaged for 6 months, to my delight. 
* Reason: traction in interviews and also in GTD and zbs
* Reason: interviews
* Reason: socket QQ was in-demand
* Reason: QQ discussions with colleagues .. visible progress

Both job decisions produced good/superior leverage over 5Y.

I chose a c# job ... engaged for a year and then disengaged, shorter than expected. Leverage was good.

I chose a Quant dev job ... engaged for a year and never disengaged. Leverage was underwhelming.

I chose a c++ large scale eq OMS job ... engaged for a few months. Leverage is unknown

--no blogpost: c#^java/c++ journeys
[tags t_below7]
my c# xx journey was exciting for 6M before OC and in first year in OC. In contrast, my core-java/c++ (less for jxee) journeys have generated superior ROTI (elusive) because 
* the interview topics are stable 
* market waves steered me to stick to (not abandon) these career directions

leverage? c# is lower but not bad. See separate blogpost

For all languages, there is no hike, no strategic value so at that level all underwhelming

Like Black developers .. As an older developer I also have higher visibility.
IFF I apply myself (localSys) and establish a foundation at a new site as Piroz does, I think I could survive and possibly show my hidden strengths.

However, at Stirt I was unable to outshine other guys.

At Macq, I was unable to impress bosses.
