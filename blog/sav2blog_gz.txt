--new blogpost: self-esteem: stigma^salary gap
In terms of my past experiences of self-esteem under attack, which attacks were more serious and high  priority for future planning?
? stigma/appraisal/coworkerBenchmark
? salary gap cf peers -- relatively easy to accept
? brank -- I have kind of given up on this front after I chose the contractor career
? property and other assets

--new blogpost: salary has least impact on family well-being
sometimes I feel 20k lower salary doesn't affect my self-esteem or family well-being. In contrast, stigma/respect/coworkerBenchmark, commute, workload have bigger impact on self-esteem and family well-being

Suppose i invest heavily and become very productive on a local c++system. 
Or a java, or SQL, or socket, pyhton, tibrv system. 
Now, any local system uses only a small portion of the language features.. at most 2% of the advanced interview topics on that language. 
Therefore the experience won't give me confidence to be an expert on the language... but acing multiple QQ interviews does as these interviews compare dozens of candidates across the field. 

I grew very confident of java through this type of external benchmarking, in contrast to internal benchmarking within the local team.

i didn't need high salary so badly, so what's the real reasons why I sacrifice so much to re-enter U.S.?
rebuild confidence about career/financial foundation for next 25Y, since my passive-income/asset/burn-rate profile is far from comfortable
rebuild self esteem.. stigma?

when I get obsessed with brank peer comparison (against "peers" in china), i miss out on all sorts of more important things like kids, ffree, body shape, diet control, wellness, 

if I were a mgr like Miao in a bank, I would feel ..

my value-add is tied to this firm and not portable compared to a techie

I got to this position by building local relationships, learning the localSys and local workflow
.. so it's hard to be confident about repeating the same at another firm

competitive pressure from younger managers

if at same pay, i would prefer eq than drv pricing domain, due to mkt depth and job pool

--no blogpost: I actually felt good receiving low salary offers like Baml-repo, Nasdaq and NCS
Somehow it confirms my value-add to the economy, my "health condition"
