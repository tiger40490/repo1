--new: stay]shape4CIV+QQ till50?
(I would say QQ is my relative advantage, even though the HFT shops may think otherwise.)

QQ benefits from thick->thin (and xRef) ... one of the key competitive advantages I could develop through blogging

High-end CIV is only needed at top west-coast shops, not my realistic target. I think most of the top performers are young


--one reason that contract rate can be higher than FTE base
contract rate can be adjusted down. If employer feels this rate is too high, they can let it expire.

Many of my peers don't like it but I don't mind.

My PWM period saw the deadliest stress in my life, because I had to fight not only for my self-esteem, but for the family's "one-n-only" chance in the U.S. 
I felt if i couldn't survive at GS I would have to give up U.S. forever, and never have a 2nd chance in the U.S. 

(A year later, at end of 2010, I decided to bring family back to SG.)

The burden on my shoulder was crushing. I could barely breathe!

At that stage, only one manager's assessment was at play, but I didn't know it. I was brainwashed to believe that my performance was clearly under the bar.

sg job market remains as slow and thin as before. Still financial jobs constitute 90% of my job pool
JC has more suitable jobs than SG has including start-up.

Singapore non-finance companies simply can't afford because the main street dev salary is much lower than U.S.

The wall st salary level is largely influenced by west coast and also main street dev salary.

Like Black developers .. As an older Singaporean developer I also have higher visibility.
IFF I apply myself (localSys) and establish a foundation at a new site as Piroz does, I think I could survive and possibly show my hidden strengths.

However, at Stirt I was unable to outshine other guys.

At Macq, I was unable to impress bosses.

the IV successes define me.
Without these successes, I am likely to feel a total failure and worthless. I will probably fall into this pit more than once a years -- self-knowledge.
