--new: contract rate is not benchmarked against FTE
If my contract rate is higher than FTE team members, we say that it's not comparable as my employer gets a cut and I also pay more taxes and have no benefits.

If my contract rate is lower than FTE team members, then we often say it's due to market rate. Not sure why, but I don't feel inferior. 

This factor becomes crucial in a PIP situation. The FTE victim would get a donut bonus and donut raise, and her base would fall below some very junior team members .. unbearable humiliation. 

No such humiliation on a non-performing contractor. They just let the contract expire.

I think the boss wants to let him go but may feel merciful, so they keep him but give him shitty tasks and demand fast turnaround at good quality.... unreasonable/unfair workload.

A small number of old timers change job but regret as new job turns out worse. 
Other old timers hear those war-stories and prefer the certainty of known pain in the current job. They don't feel confident they can find a better job.

Many older times can't afford bench time due to low reserve and high burn rate. Old timers tend to be too used to stable income. Damien of Macq relied on his bonus payout.. Davis had no savings at all.
Most older times won't take on a 6M contract.
Most older times will never consider a voluntary pay cut
some older times worry about job loss so much that they work their ass off to keep the job, even if the workload is unreasonable/unfair. I think in GS I was like them .
Some old timers have a wife who completely opposes job change due to potential impact on family.

why XR and I can afford to quit a job, stay home, and find a lower job? Because of supportive wife, burn rate, passive income and savings.

sg job market remains as slow and thin as before. Still financial jobs constitute 90% of my job pool
JC has more suitable jobs than SG has including start-up.

Singapore non-finance companies simply can't afford because the main street dev salary is much lower than U.S.

The wall st salary level is largely influenced by west coast and also main street dev salary.

Like Black developers .. As an older Singaporean developer I also have higher visibility.
IFF I apply myself (localSys) and establish a foundation at a new site as Piroz does, I think I could survive and possibly show my hidden strengths.

However, at Stirt I was unable to outshine other guys.

At Macq, I was unable to impress bosses.

the IV successes define me.
Without these successes, I am likely to feel a total failure and worthless. I will probably fall into this pit more than once a years -- self-knowledge.

one-long-job resume can be bad when you change career
I always felt my job-hopper resume is a liability, but west coast shops don't care
