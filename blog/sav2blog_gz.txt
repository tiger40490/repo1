so far, during this Memorial trip, I had no motivation (beside the interviews) to study. If you ask me why, I'm too distracted by my son's studies. This one concern acts like a sponge, absorbing all my spare time and mental energy
--update blogpost on long^short term stress
When my investment (like BGC) is in trouble, the stress is real, but much lower than 10% of the stress due to stigma/pip

If I'm below average in the team, but manager doesn't create a stigma out of it, then I am OK. I can simply tell myself that other guys are very bright and have longer experience with the local system.

--new blogpost: Indeed rejection pain=way below stigma/pip
I had high hopes, so the pain is proportional to the height, but it's like 1% of the pain from stigma of pip/damagedGood

I do feel inferior in terms of coding test skills, but this feeling is not even 10% of the pain from stigma/pip/damagedGood

--new blogpost: gains from Indeed experience #worth the $sacrifice
* gain -- first hand intuition about what algo topics are possibly out of scope at these interviews
* gain -- first hand knowledge of young competition
* gain -- experience with SDI, comparable to Nsdq
* gain -- real insight into where I'm lacking. battleground experience with tough algo questions. I told my son he needs to embrace himself for the real exams. I think I can improve my battleground performance
* gain -- some in-depth discussions on age discrimination

based on recent IV experience (mostly Indeed), i feel my study effort should be 80% coding drill and 20% QQ

--new blogpost: 150k with light load: which FTE
some ibanks like OC, Citi, UBS, BONY
new codebase
smaller codebase -- like RTS
older workforce -- like RTS
less glamorous -- like RTS, back office

--new blogpost: if not4$$,y I sacrifice so much2reenter U.S.
i didn't need high salary so badly, so what's the real reasons why I sacrifice so much to re-enter U.S.?
rebuild confidence about career/financial foundation for next 25Y, since my passive-income/asset/burn-rate profile is far from comfortable
rebuild self esteem.. stigma?

when I get obsessed with brank peer comparison (against "peers" in china), i miss out on all sorts of more important things like kids, ffree, body shape, diet control, wellness, 

if I were a mgr like Miao in a bank, I would feel ..

my value-add is tied to this firm and not portable compared to a techie

I got to this position by building local relationships, learning the localSys and local workflow
.. so it's hard to be confident about repeating the same at another firm

competitive pressure from younger managers
--no blogpost:
quant knowledge used to be a halo, now replaced by coding IV skills like
* DP, recursion
* data structures
* speed coding 

I now feel all of these + QQ knowledge are all white elephants not directly relevant to GTD
