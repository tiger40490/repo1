====new: boxer beaten@corner
OK you thought you were a good boxer. Now you are pushed to the corner of the ring and taking a severe beating. Can you fight your way out?

In the past I could often fight my way out. Not in GS. I was beaten and beaten and beaten.. like a boxer in the corner. I was challenged to deliver, GTD... My self-esteem as a strong techie took a brutal beating. I was "shown" weaker than many techies in the team or the department .. "Look at what they did to Victor .. Horrific.. Carnage".

In terms of theoretical knowledge or innovative design I might be somewhat stronger than some peers but I was cornered on brown-field..

The damage can be destructive -- it destroys your self-confidence, self-esteem, self-worth

I had another one (smaller-scale) at Stirt.

--trapped due to visa and no internal transfer .. "cornered" and nowhere to hide. 
This only happened to me at GS. I think this factor increased by (50% to) 100% the severity of the destructive damage.

How about the first Deepak@RTS? I think he had to leave for his own sanity
 
--put up a good fight and exit
I did that in Macq but at GS I was trapped

Look at Jack Z at MS. Probably trapped in the same way.

--green field ... was my relative strength 
The beating was more on brown-field. 

In Macq, green-field also suffered a beating.

--aging -- localSys (esp. learning large codebase) ... is taxing on the aging memory. 
I *guess* GregM (RTS) might be a cautionary tale. 
He relied on his theoretical knowledge to pass interviews, but not fast enough with local codebase

Is green field better than brown-field codebase? I guess so. Green-field projects are rarely given to a new joiner but contractors are often hired on green field budget. Look at Citi, 95G and volFitter !

Now consider this separate question: 
Q: Are the c++11 QQ topics a form of churn on the interview competition?
A: Yes but I feel the wore scene is localSys on the job. c++11 QQ is lighter.

Q: how about the Coding IV? still lighter stress than localSys. I can take my time.

sg job market remains as slow and thin as before. Still financial jobs constitute 90% of my job pool
JC has more suitable jobs than SG has including start-up.

Singapore non-finance companies simply can't afford because the main street dev salary is much lower than U.S.

The wall st salary level is largely influenced by west coast and also main street dev salary.

--no
Like Black developers .. As an older Singaporean developer I also have higher visibility.
IFF I apply myself (localSys) and establish a foundation at a new site as Piroz does, I think I could survive and possibly show my hidden strengths.

However, at Stirt I was unable to outshine other guys.

At Macq, I was unable to impress bosses.

the IV successes define me.
Without these successes, I am likely to feel a total failure and worthless. I will probably fall into this pit more than once a years -- self-knowledge.

one-long-job resume can be bad when you change career
I always felt my job-hopper resume is a liability, but west coast shops don't care
