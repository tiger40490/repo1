My sense is that Yixin decided to test the boundary around yet another standard advice (this time from an authority besides his parents). Here are other examples of standard advice that has fallen on deaf ears:

* arrive at O-levels exam venue 30 minutes in advance
* prepare exam equipment 24H in advance, not on the 11th hour
* arrive at airport at least 2 hours in advance
* while waiting to board a flight, stay with family, rather than going far out on your own without a phone
* personal wellness: eat healthy food, rather than fried, sugary stuff
* personal wellness: drink plain water, rather than sugary beverage. Parents have warned him of diabetes risks, every month.
* personal wellness: daily tooth brushing, to prevent dental plaque
* personal hygiene: daily shower
* personal hygiene: clean your face after eating a messy food
* personal hygiene: change your clothing after it gets visibly dirty
* anti-social: don't play loud music past midnight
* anti-social: turn off loud music on your phone or walk away, when your family is watching a home movie and unable to hear dialog
* anti-social: don't let people wait for you on the street, 45 minutes beyond pre-agreed time
* anti-social: after a family outing decision (30-minute debate), do not change direction midway for no reason. If other people object to your new direction, then follow the original family decision, rather than going your way (my way or no way).

Why do people enjoy risky Everest climb, scuba diving, or bungy jump? I never enjoy dangerous sports. The risk-reward tradeoff makes no sense to me .. no real reward at unnecessarily high risk. I think this risk-taking behavior might explain the first few items above. They do not affect other people, strictly speaking.
