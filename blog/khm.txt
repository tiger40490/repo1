--residential pros and cons
:) faster to sell because more investors are comfortable with the idea
:( not so precious
:( rental yield lower
:( higher risk of buying overpriced

--concentration risk at the bkk1 location
This location may not take off as an office location

--concentration risk in PP retail sector esp. in the bkk1 district
saturation? Oversupply?

--which office location has the lowest risk?
City Center?
Peak location?

--project: MIH
:( lesser known developer
:) Ascott lending credibility on the residential portion. Unlike all other projects

--project: diamond twin tower
:( location even more remote than theBridge
:( 150k heavy
:( in a down turn, this prime locations would hold much better

--project: purple
:) affordable, but not compared to my past shop units.
:) higher rental yield than other residential locations, only according to agents, but I feel vacancy risk is high. The rich don't prefer to rent a studio!
:) lower psf than other residential locations
:( not a prime location. I don't like the sales pitch about the potential.
