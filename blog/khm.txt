--ff rental
BridgeFF: 5% after tax
Diamond twin tower: 150k deal is "first 3 year rent-free to seller at 8% of 197k". After 3Y, rental yield could be lower.

--credit risk .. A single number is unable to capture the whole picture
In terms of the reputation at stake, Oxley is better
In terms of GRR trecï¼Œ MIH is slightly better.

Grade-A being so rare, the reputation at stake is rather high.

I have trusted Megaworld, Oxley and Ritz.

--concentration risk at the bkk1 location
This location may not take off as an office location
Orchard does have office demands.

--concentration risk in PP retail sector esp. in the bkk1 district
saturation? Oversupply?

--which office location outside current CBD has the lowest risk?
bkk1

Note BridgeFF is not grade-A and not really office. It's soho. I don't know how to categorize it, but it's somewhere between studio and small office. 
Demand will be lower compared to a real office building

--new: precious
shops are precious only in primte retail locations. Consider shops in industrial parks.

Office units are precious only in prime commercial locations.

Residential can be precious in elite locations such as school districts.

--capital-land is not EDB or GIC. The quality of management is not all the same across these firms.

Some private firms have better management.

--project: diamond twin tower
:( location even more remote than theBridge
:( 150k heavy
:( in a down turn, the prime locations would hold much better
--project: purple
:) affordable, but not compared to my past shop units.
:) higher rental yield than other residential locations, only according to agents. I feel vacancy risk is high. The rich don't prefer to rent a studio! The working class prefer convenient locations in the city.
:) lower psf than other residential locations
:( not a prime location. I don't like the sales pitch about the potential.
--residential pros and cons
:) faster to sell because more investors are familiar with the asset class
:) faster appreciation due to hot money, _but_ less stable
:( More of a commodity, not as precious as prime location shop units.
:( rental yield lower, despite what marketers say
:( higher risk of buying overpriced
