--residential pros and cons
:) faster to sell because more investors are comfortable with the asset class
:( not so precious
:( rental yield lower, despite what they say
:( higher risk of buying overpriced

--concentration risk at the bkk1 location
This location may not take off as an office location

--concentration risk in PP retail sector esp. in the bkk1 district
saturation? Oversupply?

--which office location has the lowest risk?

--maturity level
CBD is the mature commercial center. PPCC is next to CBD.

bkk1 district is rather mature as a shopping/retail district, esp. with Aeon and Nagaworld as anchors. My 3 shop units are in the right location.

Diamond island has some commercial offices but i feel the location has limited potential as a 2nd CBD

PPCC is most raw, most uncertain, but with the highest potential as a commercial office location. 
However, my psf price may be too high already.

--project: MIH
:( lesser known developer
:) Ascott lending credibility on the residential portion. Unlike all other projects

:( high quantum

:( location -- higher uncertainty
:) location -- hedge against the bkk1 district. capture the potential for both
:( location -- if no take-off within 10Y, then I would rely on developer to rent out my unit. They may not have my best interest.
:( location -- may be hard to sell

--project: diamond twin tower
:( location even more remote than theBridge
:( 150k heavy
:( in a down turn, th3 prime locations would hold much better

--project: purple
:) affordable, but not compared to my past shop units.
:) higher rental yield than other residential locations, only according to agents. I feel vacancy risk is high. The rich don't prefer to rent a studio! The working class prefer convenient locations in the city.
:) lower psf than other residential locations
:( not a prime location. I don't like the sales pitch about the potential.
