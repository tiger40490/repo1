--boy said his #1 favorite food is chips, so let's research with him on calorie density (and also other nutritions) in this and other foods

--each time I lose temper (yelling) or break my promise, boy can point out and I will pay a fine to grandpa's account, with up to 20% of the fine going to boy's account, subject to negotiation.

To be effective, this has to be printed or reviewed with boy.

--develop his confidence in geometry
low hanging fruits
less wordy
more fun
more rewarding

--jolt: focus on my roti. If some parenting effort is not effective, then stop it, even if boy is suffering in numerous ways. 
Basically, I waste time by trying to help him.

--jolt: my deep (vague) disappointment with my renzi effort was largely due to the worldly, materialistic "progress". 
No progress, then i feel time wasted. That's materialistic and impatience.

----fuxi: Chinese parenting, and Buddhism emphasizes self-restraint.
Western culture emphasizes hard driving, achievement, so I think some motivated or high-achievers have limited self-restraint

gaming is the prime example.

I should talk to more people with a gaming hobby, or smoking hobby, ... Rahul is one
These individuals could be very motivated, hard-working, high-flying

I think grandpa is a huge influence on me, but perhaps there are some more successful individuals in his circle with some of those habits.
