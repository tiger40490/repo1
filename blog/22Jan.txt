22 Jan 21.17 i received a distress call from Elaina. Yixin's phone had a screen replacement 3 days ago, after Mom persuaded him to replace a crack. Today (22 Jan 2025) he found the cheap new screen unusable for gaming. In a rage he threatened to smash Mom's iPhone. Over the distress call I heared furious shouting so i called 999. When Yixin found out police was coming he threatened me.

Police case E/20250122/0173

-- Elaina's risk exposure --
In the distress call, Elaina's voice was kept very low. She sounded truamatized. I soon found out why. 

After reaching home, I instructed Elaina to be brave about calling police. She said she didn't dare. Elaina said she was scared of Yixin's beating. Later behind closed doors, Elaina enacted to demonstrate (to me alone) how Yixin had grabbed her collar during her distress call to me, n scolded her for calling Dad (me). Yixin then yelled at me over the same call, n blackmailed me against calling police. 

Elaina had lost her confidence to call 999. We need to rebuild her confidence.
