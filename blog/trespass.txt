The original police officer may or may not be there on court date. Need to be (not "act", not "show") honest to him.

Court date may change, so better call the court on Thu to find out.

On court, better control your emotion. It usually works against you.

In front of law enforcement, always show your hands and avoid abrupt movements, as they react to any sign of guns

At this juncture, it's probably effective to reassure myself that worst comes to worst I will end up with this petty criminal record, but in most cases i would get a chance to explain how minor it actually is. 战略上藐视它， 战术上重视它

In JC, the NJTP can only issue criminal charges, not MOs (muni ordinance) but usually the prosecutor will drop it to MO. "He will work with you."

Paperwork -- just the ticket

--cop's judgment call
The moment I got down to the tracks, I was trespasser (?) even though there was no signpost at the station. Cop would usually give a warning but I ignored his instruction, so he charged me for (criminal) defiant trespass
