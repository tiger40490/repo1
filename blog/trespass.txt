In JC, the NJTP can only issue criminal charges, not MOs (muni ordinance) but usually the prosecutor will drop it to MO. "He will work with you."

The original police officer may or may not be there on court date. Need to be sincere and honest to him.

Paperwork -- just the ticket

Court date may change, so better call the court on Thu to find out.

Better control your emotion. It usually works against you.

In front of law enforcement, always show your hands and avoid abrupt movements, as they react to any sign of guns

At this juncture, it's probably effective to reassure myself that worst comes to worst I will get this criminal record, but in most cases i would get a chance to explain how minor it actually is.
