--new: consider American school
Perhaps the academic benchmark pressure is much lower in an American or international school.

--develop his confidence in geometry
low hanging fruits
less wordy
more fun
more rewarding

--jolt: focus on my roti. If some parenting effort is not effective, then stop it, even if boy is suffering in numerous ways. 
Basically, I waste time by trying to help him.

--gr8idea: take-up-for-fun
My assumption -- he has lost the basic skills. Pushing him hard will be ineffective.

温和地坚持

On the other hand, he probably needs more perseverance. He has a tendency to give up and puts in fake effort

Note Take-up-for-fun involves facetime and can create pain (frustration/regret/losing-cool) in me, despite the 'for-fun' slogan.
-- my deep (vague) disappointment with my renzi effort was largely due to the worldly, materialistic "progress". 
No progress, then i feel time wasted. That's materialistic and impatience.

--consider separate blog on parenting
but the 94 posts in tpy blog are kinda well-defined

--Do I have time to prune the old blogs?

--gr8idea: word problem homework: even one correct is achievement
I promised boy that he would NOT be scolded if he could get one word problem correct.

One-correct usually implies he did listen attentively.

--proposal: I will send a secret target between 30 and 60 sheets of my math practice. He needs to complete it before I would join the outing. By default, they would go there without me.

--gr8idea: reduce workload
From NY, I said daddy would complete some homework for you if too hard. 

His basic arithmetics needs more practice.

I need to rethink. He probably needs more perseverance.

--gr8idea: at most one problem per weekday night
and must start by 9pm

--digitize a pool of 10-> 20 common and EASY word problems at p2-p4 levels
Ensure he masters the common pattern-recog. I think the patterns are also relevant in the U.S. exams.

Tie big rewards () and small rewards() to his performance on MY questions.

My effort is really on collecting common exam questions.  I hate to do this but I think my son lacks the motivation to do it for himself.

--I should talk to more people with a gaming hobby, or smoking hobby, ... Rahul is one
These individuals could be very motivated, hard-working, high-flying

I think grandpa is a huge influence on me, but perhaps there are some more successful individuals in his circle with some of those habits.
