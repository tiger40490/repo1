Q: Deed of assignment ... received?

Q: One reason I am leaving NCT is sense of urgency. NCT has several units perhaps including his family's units, so i don't feel he would give any priority to me.

Q5: For small repairs tenants should pay. For major (like above USD 100) on a new appliance, I propose a long-term tenant pays 30%.

Q6: govt issued ID -- Only my Singapore passport and NRIC

Q7: payment in SGD -- I hope to minimize remittance, so I hope to pay SGD to your SGD bank account. Once rental starts, then hopefully you can deduct from the income.
