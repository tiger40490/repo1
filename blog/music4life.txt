--fuxi: paying^self-learn^procrastination
For python camp, WP hosting, yoga and piano, I tend to compare paying vs self-teach

Why don't I compare paying vs procrastination? This comparison is the more realistic picture of choices. I need to get real and accept the imprefect self.

I think paying may give me the boost I need in self-confidence.
