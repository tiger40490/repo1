goal of quick take-up: depends on quick sight reading, quick fingering arrangement

-- fuxi:
workout has given way to piano because ... payment!

quarterly payment works well. Let's extend by another quarter.

--fuxi: piano base clarity
Sugg: some piano tuners may be able to improve base clarity
Carpet and bigger piano room can help improve base clarity
German piano is knwon for better base clarity

--fuxi: dazzling finger dexterity 
On youtube we see (intermediate level) pianists showing sophisticated finger dexterity.
Well, my son also shows that to some extent.

But is that valuable to me, in the grand scheme of things?

Remember the 610 rugs experience? That level of meticulous organization is unneeded. It can be a pure recreation or very low ROTI endeavor.

--fuxi: paying^self-learn^procrastination
For python camp, WP hosting, yoga and piano, I tend to compare paying vs self-teach

Why don't I compare paying vs procrastination? This comparison is the more realistic picture of choices. I need to get real and accept the imprefect self.

I think paying may give me the boost I need in self-confidence.

I paid huge amount for UChicago. Without it I doubt I would persist on my own. I would be clueless.
