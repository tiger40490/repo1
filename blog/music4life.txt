workout has given way to piano because ... payment!

--new: piano practice as a pastime
piano (and other music) skill is not at the same level as gaming, or sight-seeing.

Musical skills require absorbency (more than singing). Like jogging, it strengths self-efficacy, raises self-esteem, 

Musical journey is a struggle, between the level of recreational workout and benchmarked workout. 
There's some form of penalty if you don't put in a miminum amount of practice .. you don't achieve anything and you waste your effort.
Therefore it demands a commitment.

.. sink, buffer, slack resources
Piano practice is an excellent energy sink. If 3H/week, then it becomes a good reserve of slack resource, a buffer of extra time. See blogpost on buffers and alternatives.

--fuxi: paying^self-learn^procrastination
For python camp, WP hosting, yoga and piano, I tend to compare paying vs self-teach

Why don't I compare paying vs procrastination? This comparison is the more realistic picture of choices. I need to get real and accept the imprefect self.

I think paying may give me the boost I need in self-confidence.

I paid huge amount for UChicago. Without it I doubt I would persist on my own. I would be clueless.
