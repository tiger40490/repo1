-- new: ChnM billing
话费 .. your account balance. Can be used to pay monthly subscription, outging minutes or GB [i.e. mobile data]
Each month, RMB 18 is deducted from acct balance, without pro-ration. Around 2 July, the Y18 deduction will probably fail.
The plan [套餐] has no bundled GB or outgoing minutes, so these coss are displayed as 套餐外 xxx
PAYU [pay-as-you-use] .. RMB 3 is "auto-deducted" from your account, to buy 1GB as needed. Similarly, RMB 0.19 is deducted to buy each minute of outgooing air time.

Itemized billing .. available in the app or at end of month in final bill.

ZLH account: starting balance RMB42. RMB18 deducted...
TB account: starting balance RMB28 + top-up RMB10 by grandma = RMB38. RMB18 deducted, then about Y5 of cumulative airtime. Y6 for 2GB.

-- update bpost on VPN
Need to accept the reality of China firewall.. Don't be bitter or resentful. China government is not completely without justification. Focus on solutions. 

Note some workhorse sites [dreamhost, github,,] are accessible by wifi but not ChnM hotspot. Don't rely on blog for important info.

Solution: pay a bit for a reliable VPN 
Solution: use git-blog .. git-push once a day via roaming-hotspot or hotel wifi or home wifi

Tip: when hotel wifi is stable, do more git blogging.

-- new: Thank God for some things on the trip
Nothing lost or stolen so far.
No one fell sick so far. No need to seek emergency medical.
Not cheated anywhere so far.
Didn't run out of RMB cash so far.
Didn't lose meimei so far.

CMLink roaming works as expected, without fast depletion so far. Mlphone roaming works as expected. 

Had some quality chats with grandpa.

Meimei is close to daddy.

-- new: well down on the trip
Ate plenty of fruits ever day.
Some simple exercise almost everyday.
Coping with the loss of quiet time, not effectively, but better than passive acceptance.

-- update bpost on Jun2023 trip
todo: take out CMLink card and leave in hotel. Check usage every day.
todo: put grandpa's SIM into my phone, and remember to return it to him.

-- update which bpost?
need a light n warmer shirt for next flight. If no such shirt, then rely on blanket.

yoga blocks are useful on flights .. leg stretches, convex sitting

plastic bag hungable from my bottle .. good for acceptable rubbish, my food box, reading content..

too many small bottles to bring back to Sg? Empty them, and dump into big luggage.
