-- new: transit card: Absolutely essential
Option 1: the äº¿xx app

-- new or update: precious quiet time
Similar to Korean trip. Next time consider one more room.
Somewhat similar to 2020 circuit breaker period.

I am losing my  5/wk, my diet control (chia), my dental control, 

When I reach hotel, I now spend a few hours on "clean-up".

==== new: ## G3 frustrations
real-name .. e-payment; mobileNum; subway; bike sharing; tourist attractions;
.. extra-hard for foreigners.
need to rely on numerous mobile apps .. just as driving is to American lifestyle.
quiet time (+ personal space ] hotel) .. blogg
.. see separate blog

-- EOR
risk of losing valuables .. /background-heat/. See separate section

-- worst possible losses ranked... Be conscious of the relative value of each!
passport .. 1.5M wait
iPhones
transit card
~~ other items 
laptop .. seldom carried 
new purchases .. usually low value

-- update which bpost?
need a light n warmer shirt for next flight. If no such shirt, then rely on blanket.

yoga blocks are useful on flights .. leg stretches, convex sitting

plastic bag hungable from my bottle .. good for acceptable rubbish, my food box, reading content..

too many small bottles to bring back to Sg? Empty them, and dump into big luggage.

-- update bpost on VPN
Need to accept the reality of China firewall.. Don't be bitter or resentful. China government is not completely without justification. Focus on solutions. 

Note some workhorse sites [dreamhost, github,,] are accessible by wifi but not ChnM hotspot. Don't rely on blog for important info.

Solution: pay a bit for a reliable VPN 
Solution: use git-blog .. git-push once a day via roaming-hotspotS or hotel wifi or home wifi

Tip: when hotel wifi is stable, do more git blogging.

-- fuxi: Thank God for some things on the trip
Nothing lost or stolen so far.
No one fell sick so far. No need to seek emergency medical.
Not cheated anywhere so far.
Didn't run out of RMB cash so far.
Didn't lose meimei so far.

CMLink roaming works as expected, without fast depletion so far. Mlphone roaming works as expected. 

Had some quality chats with grandpa.

Meimei is close to daddy.

-- fuxi: well down on the trip
Ate plenty of fruits ever day.
Some simple exercise almost everyday.
Coping with the loss of quiet time, not effectively, but better than passive acceptance.

-- new: bike shar`]BJ
I can't afford to rely on something unpredictable.

Plan 0: don't rely on bike sharing. Buy a cheap bike if needed. Own bike is easier to operate.

Plan 1 (not really a base plan): rely on yellow bike, set up manual top-up from Any bank card. (wcpay would be a good second top-up source.) Accept the various surprises. (Citibike and SgBike etc also come with surprises.) 

~~ green.. Didi cab/bike
smrz pending, affecting bank card binding
ppd not funded :(
Tested: scan via wechat, but tedious
Tested: one-tap scan, ending with Alipay
Alipay gives new users benefit of the doubt

~~ blue.. Hello bike/cab
smrz not sue.. smrz initially set up via Alipay, but not showing as verified. Bank card binding or Alipay binding are nowhere
ppd funding by Aliay/wcpay.. good enough
Tested: one-tap scan

~~ yellow .. meituan
smrz under grandma, binding her bank card
ppd funded by bank card
