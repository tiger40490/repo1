-- new or update: precious quiet time
Similar to Korean trip. Next time consider one more room.
Somewhat similar to 2020 circuit breaker period.

I am losing my  5/wk, my diet control (chia), my dental control, 

When I reach hotel, I now spend a few hours on "clean-up".

-- fuxi: Thank God for some things on the trip
Nothing lost or stolen so far.
No one fell sick so far. No need to seek emergency medical.
Not cheated anywhere so far.
Didn't run out of RMB cash so far.
Didn't lose meimei so far.

CMLink roaming works as expected, without fast depletion so far. Mlphone roaming works as expected. 

Had some quality chats with grandpa and also some with grandma.

Meimei is close to daddy.

-- fuxi: well done on the trip
Ate plenty of fruits ever day.
Some simple exercise almost everyday.
Coping with the loss of quiet time, not effectively, but better than passive acceptance.
