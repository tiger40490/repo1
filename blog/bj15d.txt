-- update Korean trip: precious quiet time
Similar to Korean trip. Next time consider one more room.
Somewhat similar to 2020 circuit breaker period.

I am losing my  5/wk, my diet control (chia), my dental control, 

When I reach hotel, I now spend a few hours on "clean-up".

-- Thank God for some things on the trip
Nothing lost or stolen.
No one fell sick. No need to seek emergency medical.
Not cheated anywhere.
Didn't run out of RMB cash.
Didn't lose meimei.
CMLink roaming works as expected, without fast depletion. Mlphone roaming works as expected. ChM service is inexpensive n reliable
Meimei is growing closer to daddy.

-- well done on the trip
Ate plenty of fruits ever day.
Some simple exercise almost everyday.
Coping with the loss of quiet time, not effectively, but better than passive acceptance.
No big regretable purchases
Had some quality chats with grandpa and also some with grandma.
We all controlled our temper to avoid serious disharmony

-- last-day: excelleng plann and execution
wife's ChM SIM refunded
rmb 348 + 50 refunded
booked Didi in advance. got into taxi by 1pm.. hit airport within 45 min
