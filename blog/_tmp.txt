--Q: in graph DFT and BFT, do we need a "seen" hashtable to remember visited nodes?
I think so. The textbook DFT/BFT algos use white/grey/black for this purpose

--reassess my ffree
current burn rate is not SGD 2.5k. more like 7k

--Since I don't need to worry so much about cash flow .. close to ffree, what jobs would I enjoy?
* respect, app ... freedom from stigma
* impact? Not really important to me
* domain: devops?
* domain: quant dev? 
* domain: inet? impactful but not more enjoyable than my recent jobs
* domain: mkt data? impactful but not more enjoyable
