I have a habit of recording my conversations, to avoid loss of memory... Below are my recollections, roughly ranked from less to more noteworthy

* health conditions .. you are fortunate with rather few health conditions. Perhaps you have good genes from your parents. More improtantly, you have taken good care of yourself .. a form of 因果报应？

* regular workout .. I hear a few "limitations" of tennis [winter closure, partner needed]. I am better off ... I mostly exercise without equipment or assistance. I do a bit of home-yoga, a lot of jogging, outside-gym resistance training [stairs, squat,,,]

* overeating .. both of us were aware of overeating. (You told me about your KL buffett.) I have been more careful in recent months, after my CAD diagnosis. In late Nov I had a company buffett where I ate to 90% capacity ... uncomfortable and not healthy.

* closer to son or daughter .. I hear that most fathers are more tender to their daughter, but you are closer to your son, partly due to proximity. If I were to ask my dad, I think he would say closer to son. 

* negative perception of my son .. I need to repair father-son bonding, immediately. I was speaking to you 100% negative about my son....

* Your bilingual advantage .. I think you landed your current job partly due to bilingual skill. Did this skill also help with your earlier jobs? 
I exchange emails with many Chinese friends. Most of them are not effective in English writing/speaking, but you are.

* what age to retire .. you sounded like you wanted to retire in "a few years", perhaps after both kids start working. But I also hear that you had not saved millions? Perhaps you want to retire in China or Malaysia? You also pointed out that retirement can mark a mental decline. I agree 100% and want to keep working into my 70s and 80s, possibly in training/education.

* Malaysia as retirement destination .. we briefly touched on the advantages like healthcare, climate, Chinese concentration. I hope we both give it more thoughts and take it seriously.

* teaching as a second career .. you mentioned music teaching. You were once a teacher yourself. I now think our bilingual skills are valuable in a teaching career in Singapore/Malaysia. My degrees from NUS and UChicago are well-recognized. Teaching is beautifully interactive and will keep me active and engaged.

* jobs outside finance ..

* workload, work stress ..

* small employers .. For close to 20 years, I have told recruiters and my friends that I don't mind a small employer (like PremiumTech) with lower salary/benefits, and lower business continuity.

* assertive .. you told me a story of your assertive email response to your CEO. (Your China colleagues would react differently.) I also shared my stories. I think I need to be more careful with assertive communication.
