You spent hours travelling here to visit me, not to mention the financial cost. I should have paid for our dinner. Next time, I might take a train to KL.

I have a habit of recording my conversations, to avoid loss of memory... Below are my recollections, roughly ranked from less to more noteworthy.

* health conditions .. you are fortunate with rather few known health conditions. Perhaps you have good genes from your parents. More improtantly, you have taken good care of yourself .. a form of 因果报应？ Still, better get proactive screening (which helped me uncover my undiagnosed CAD condition.)

* regular workout .. I hear a few "limitations" of tennis [winter closure, partner needed]. I am "better" ... I mostly exercise without equipment or assistance. I do a bit of home-yoga, a lot of jogging, outside-gym resistance training [stairs, squat,push-up,,] I used to visit gym with my son.

* overeating .. both of us were aware of overeating. (You told me about your KL buffett.) I have been more careful in recent months, after my diagnosis. More self-restraint needed.

* closer to son, or daughter? I hear that most fathers are more tender to their daughter, but you are closer to your son, partly due to proximity. If I were to ask my dad, I think he would say closer to son. My sister spends less time with them, but still they are on good terms. 

My son is now closer to mom than dad. Not a bad thing.

My daugher (11) has always felt closer to mom, but I feel a lot of warm and tender love for my sweetheart.

You invested a lot of time and resources in your daughter's music career. All the funding comes from dad the bread-earner. Hopefully she remembers it.

* negative perception/description of my son .. I need to repair father-son bonding, immediately. I was speaking 100% negative about him. I was wise not to go into specific details, which could easily paint a unfair, lop-sided portrait of him.

* Your bilingual advantage .. I think you landed your current job partly due to bilingual skill. Did it also help with your earlier jobs? 

I exchange emails with many friends from mainland. Most of them are guys and not effective (women are better) in English writing/speaking, but you are. I will write you more. No obligation to reply.

* what age to retire .. you sounded like you wanted to retire in "a few years", perhaps after both kids start working. But I also hear that you had not saved millions? Perhaps you want to retire in China or Malaysia? 

You also pointed out that retirement can mark a start of mental decline. I agree 100%. I want to keep working into my 80s, possibly in training/education, or volunteering.

You have interest in classical music and sight-seeing. Like my poor dad, I have very few true hobbies/recreations [stocks? coding?] so I don't look forward to retiring.

* Malaysia as retirement destination .. we briefly touched on the advantages like healthcare, climate, Chinese concentration. I hope we both give it more thoughts and take it seriously.

* workload, work stress .. FinTech/FinIT is always stressful due to tight deadlines, high stakes.

* jobs outside finance .. We briefly touched on this. It's been tough. 

* teaching as a second career .. you mentioned music teaching. You were once a teacher yourself. I now think our bilingual skills are valuable in a teaching career in Singapore/Malaysia. My degrees from NUS and UChicago are well-recognized. Teaching is beautifully interactive and will keep me active and engaged.

* small employers .. For close to 20 years, I have told recruiters and my friends that I don't mind a small employer (like PremiumTech) with lower salary/benefits, and lower business longevity.

* assertive .. you told me a story of your assertive email response to your CEO. (Your China colleagues would react differently.) I also shared my stories. I think I need to be careful with assertive communication.
