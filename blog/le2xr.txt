Hi Xia Rong,

I felt great to meet an old friend after 4.5 years. Seeing is believing -- I now believe you are healthy, sharp, engaged, full of energy and vitality, fighting your battles ... I would not have this level of insight without seeing your body language close-up. 
You looked barely aged. Age still catches us. I vaguely remember you said some blood test revealed some condition that affects weight and metabolism slow-down. (Good thing that you didn't overeat at WuLiangYe.) My appetite has reduced with age but it is still healthy. How do you feel about your appetite?

I see you are generally careful with nutrition, and your get some regular exercise. How is your sleep? 

I am asking the same question to myself, you and other friends -- "What are your livelihood pressures?" For you, I think one worry is keeping your current job while resisting the management pressure to attend office. Another worry is losing your compeitiveness on coding interviews. 

A long-term concern is retirement destination. I see that you have a preference for Singapore but your wife doesn't share that. When I mention Singapore to friends from U.S. or many countries, I hear all-positive comments. Does your wife feel positive about Singapore?

Overall, I see your life has settled down (except quant research). We are past our peak and maintaining our career, health, cashflow high ground. ( Some friends I met on this trip are less lucky. Some have unstable marriage, uncomfortable/intolerable job, interview setbacks. )

Your health (and mine) is mostly satisfactory, with various aging declines. These declines take years and follow a curve .. They are gentle for now and we should feel lucky, before we go through a less gentle, slightly more steep decline.

Thanks for making the trip to meet up in WuLiangYe. After I left NYC in 2019, this WuLiangYe lunch could be the only chance over 10Y to see each other.
