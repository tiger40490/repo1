I am asking the same question to both of us and other friends "What are your livelihood pressures ?" For you, I think one worry is keeping your current job while resisting the pressure to attend office. Another worry is losing your fitness on coding interviews. 

A health concertn is weight and metabolism slow-down (Good thing that you didn't overeat at our meet-up.) My appetite has reduced with age but it is still healthy. How do you feel about your appetite?

I see you are generally careful with nutrition, and your get some regular exercise. How is your sleep? 

A long-term concern is retirement destination. I see that you like Singapore but your wife doesn't share it.

Overall, I see your life has settled down. We are past our peak and maintaining our career, health, cashflow high ground.

Your health (and mine) is mostly satisfactory, with various aging declines. These declines take years and follow a curve. They are gentle for now and we should feel lucky, before we go through a less gentle, slightly more steep decline.

I felt great to meet an old friend after 4.5 years. Seeing is believing -- I now believe you are healthy, sharp, engaged, full of energy and vitality, fighting your battles ... I would not have this level of insight without seeing your body language close-up.
