Thanks for your kind words about my Dad. I don't remember your encounter with him. He was satisfied with what he had throughout his final years. You are right about that. He wanted to complete his research projects in classical Chinese literature, history, and culture. Since 2010, he has published 5 to 10 more heavy books. After his death, I discovered some of his new books that he intended to donate. I took it as my mission to get it done. 

He lived a full life (till age 89) and passed away a satisfied old man. 

I think in 2010 my father was only 74, in good health. Since then, I have met him almost every year except the Covid19 years (2021-2022). Even during my U.S. years, I would visit Singapore when he was also there. I feel lucky that I managed to maximize our days spent together.
