I am asking the same question to both of us and other friends "What are your livelihood pressures ?" For you, I think one worry is keeping your current job while resisting the pressure to attend office. Another worry is losing your fitness on coding interviews. A health concertn is weight and metabolism slow-down (Good thing that you didn't overeat at our meet-up.)

A long-term concern is retirement destination. I see that you like Singapore but your wife doesn't.

Overall, I see your life has settled down. We are past our peak and maintaining our career, health, cashflow high ground.

Your health (and mine) is mostly satisfactory, with various aging declines. These declines take years and follow a curve. They are gentle for now and we should feel lucky, before we go through a less gentle, slightly more steep decline.

I see you are generally careful with nutrition, and your regular exercise is modest. How is your sleep?

I see your concern over inflation. I am a believer of investing to combat inflation. I have faith in Singapore government's power and determination to rein in inflation. I don't have reliable records, but I guess the level of inflation in whatever food/transport/consumables that I buy is mild even during the last 2 years (2022/2023), perhaps 1~5% a year. Will inflation stay at this level? I am optimistic, and don't worry about it.

I felt great to meet an old friend after 4.5 years. Hope to meet again when you bring your family to see Singapore.
