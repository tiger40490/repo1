I am asking the same question to both of us and other friends "What are your livelihood pressures ?" For you, I think one worry is keeping your current job while resisting the pressure to attend office. Another worry is losing your fitness on coding interviews. A health concertn is weight and metabolism slow-down (Good thing that you didn't overeat at our meet-up.)

A long-term concern is retirement destination. I see that you like Singapore but your wife doesn't.

Overall, I see your life has settled down. We are past our peak and maintaining our career, health, cashflow high ground.

I felt great to meet an old friend after 4.5 years. Hope to meet again when you bring your family to see Singapore.
