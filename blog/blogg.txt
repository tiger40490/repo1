Frequently, I find some bposts worth reviewing, but it's hard to know which bpost.
t_fuxi tags, sticky flag are proven helpful. 

Need to invest more time learning ctbz in titles.

Title is not supposed to be an essay. Chinese characters are more compact.

-- new: inline_keyword
Problem: there are too many tags in one blog, slowing down tag auto-suggest etc
Sugg: convert infrequent tags to inline_keyword. Add a line in some bposts "inline_keyword: xxx yyy". 
Those keywords will be designed unique [perhaps with numbers and underscores]. They can be long. They need to be stable, otherwise to rename a keyword I need a plugin.

A specific inline_keyword should have at most one defining bpost.

"->" is ambiguous when you want it to mean start to end time

-- update bpost on Korea trip
in Beijing, I feel a serious dependenncy on blogg [github, dreamhost]
This /adjustment/ to the China environment is stressful and painful. 

I need to jot down many thoughts across diverse topics. This usually requires smemo (I had), quite time, git blog, tablespace,, but don't need internet access.

dinosaurs? A negative descriptor. 

Serenity? Harmoney? 

-- update category ^ tag
category tree.

tags (not categories) offer auto-suggest.
