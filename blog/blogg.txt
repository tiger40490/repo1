-- new: safest way to downgrade wpress version
cd /home/tanbinvest/tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com
wp core download --version=6.5.5 --force

safer than a plugin (designed to downgrade)

-- fuxi:
blog titles staring with "Q:" are more visible
blog titles containing @@ is a good dram refresh because colon is poorly supported

-- new or update: t_w1rX tags
I follow a consistent standard but not 100% precise .. in w1rX, X = counts of major revisions.

In the initial phase, there could be many repaid revisions. I sometimes put X = 2 or 3. Six months later, I may reduce X ... LGng

-- fuxi: too many old bposts in gz. Practical suggestions:
* use header keyword ? like 200?
* retire more posts into placeholders

-- fuxi or update bpost on site blocked
I AM flexible. In the face of growing site blocks at end of 2023, I have taken things in my stride.

I recognize that the recent site blocks are less alarming/sensitive/harmful/toxic, less incriminating ,,, than those compliance incidents

Most companies have some restrictions
I don't take for granted whatever freedom given to me.
When a freedome is taken away, I tend to have an adjustment problem. 
I remember GS .. blogger was blocked.

-- fuxi: use both k_twister_SMS and t_selfTalk .. overlap between header keyword and tag
Better than two overlapp tags (ugly proliferation)

Need an explanation bpost .. perhaps use one of the t_selfTalk bposts.

-- "fuxi x 2" means Dram refreshed twice
