-- new: tag names ending in __
When browing my blog in the admin interface, sometimes I have to quickly tag a blog as "perhaps belonging to tag3". I tried "tag3@@" and "tag3?" and realized I must use "tag3__"

Afterwards, I could go to the tag listing and identify these "temporary tags" and clean up.

-- fuxi: I like titles with a power phrase or a sharp question. 
These blogposts follow the news journalist tradition, and tries to analyze the given topic from various angles.

dhost panel->support->dataCenters has a technical and definitive listing of all my web sites (identified by FQDN), all my databases, all my ssh user accounts.

With git blogging, I often switch between two windows -- the gitBash and the MSWE.

If your gitBash is already in a particular folder, you can run q[start . ] to launch MSWE on that folder.

You can also run q[start path/to/a/file] to launch the default application for that file extension.
