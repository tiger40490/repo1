-- can we enable comments on bposts of the last 6M, to ease updates? 

-- update category ^ tag
A tag "AA" is like "related to AA"
Many tags can coexist on a bpost, but a bpost having 3 categories is messy. Therefore, my tag-like category is quite a useful innovation.

categories have tree structure.

tags (not categories) offer auto-suggest.
-- slow-cooking new: blog/wiki ^ recoll
Active scratchpads can be implemented as a wiki, or a file in a recoll directory tree.

A wiki (including my blog) is first and foremost an info display system, so you can keep a page open forever, as one of 20 open browser tabs. If needed, you could start an hour-long edit session, but eventually, you must save and publish. Most of the time the document is in Published mode, not Edit mode.

A recoll is data storage. The Edit GUI and Display GUI are the same thing, not separate as on a web browser. Therefore, we rarely display a recoll file forever because there is a real risk of unwanted edit when we don't know how to roll back.

A recoll has more flexible organization. A wiki tree is kinda similar, but my blog is not. My blog relies on categories tree and tags.

softlink is powerful feature in unix and blog but not windows.

long title and hyperlink are powerful features in wiki not recoll

--fuxi wp super cache
too complex. Even if I turn it off for a year, and feel safe to turn in back on, I would still forget it is there. Forgetting means it would bite me.

i think caching is designed for large user base. I have a user base of 1.
