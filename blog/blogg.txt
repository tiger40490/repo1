-- fuxi: 
Frequently, I find some bposts worth reviewing, but it's hard to know which bpost.
t_fuxi tags, sticky flag are proven helpful. 

Need to invest more time learning ctbz in titles.

Title is not supposed to be lengthy like an essay. Chinese characters are proven more compact.

-- new: inline_keyword
Problem: there are too many tags in one blog, slowing down tag auto-suggest etc
Sugg: convert infrequent tags to inline_keyword. Add a line in some bposts "k_xxx k_yyy". 

Those keywords will be unique [perhaps with numbers and underscores]. They can be long. They need to be stable (perhaps external words/phrases), otherwise to rename an inline keyword I need a plugin:(

An inline keyword phrase will use underscore as connector.
Some inline keywords may be hard to remember. We can define/explain them in bposts. 
we can have one bpost defining multiple inline keywords
