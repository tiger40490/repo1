== new ## tips on tag/cat naming
If a word ends in gg/tt/pp etc followed by -ing, we should drop the "-ing". For example, blogg, tagg
-- category naming only
Categories are hierarchical. Some info can be inferred from the parent category and can be omitted.

Category sorting matters, esp. in the listing page, when I pick a category from the dropdown to display.

To "control" sorting, hot categories need two alternative names. For example, an1kang1/wellness would sort to top, while wellness/an1kang1 would sort to bottom.

If a category need to sort to top but lacks a good alternative name, then prefix 0, temporarily.
If a category must sort to bottom but lacks a good alternative name, then prefix x_, permanently.

A related consequence -- as I reduce online blogg, I get a growing backlog in git-blog.

-- fuxi: tag names ending in __
When browing my blog in the admin interface, sometimes I have to quickly tag a blog as "perhaps belonging to tag3". I tried "tag3@@" and "tag3?" and realized I must use "tag3__"

Afterwards, I could go to the tag listing and identify these "temporary tags" and clean up.

-- new or fuxi: I like titles with a power phrase or a sharp question. 
These blogposts follow the news journalist tradition, and tries to analyze the given topic from various angles.

These titles are the best solution to the proliferation of blog posts.
