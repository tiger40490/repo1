-- rename category 'theft' to 'hacked'
-- new: promote /disposable/ blogging
tcost: updating existing bpost .. obligation to find the most relevant bpost. After that, often need to integrate new content into existing.
tcost: creating brand new bpost... obligation to choose category/tags and draft good title
tcost: noisy wpress search /against/ increased blog content; overcrowded category/tags

When I have too much content in git-blog, a recommendation is ... disposable blogg i.e. expressive, reflective, therapeutic writing in git-blog (or wpress), and later move content into those fuxi_*.txt files

Email with friends .. is an exemplification of such reflective writing. "Thrown away" into gmail archive. better tcosts.
Eg: in early 2024, I did such an reflective writing on "adaptable retirement". These emails are kinda worth a dramRefersh once a while,  but ... Should they go into my blog as four-liners? Only a selected few.

Need to go through the fuxi_* files once a while or they would keep growing

split fuxi_ files by subject

-- new: WPress notices: hide
This is a persistent annoyance.. worth some t-investment

https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-admin-notices/ .. ineffective
https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-wp-notification/
https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-admin-dashboard-notices/
https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-hide-backed-notices/

We can search for "The backup of this post in your browser is different from the version below" in ssh. Once we locate the file, we can try to disable it.

-- fuxi or update bpost on site blocked
I AM flexible. In the face of growing site blocks at end of 2023, I have taken things in my stride.

I recognize that the recent site blocks are less alarming/sensitive/harmful/toxic, less incriminating ,,, than those compliance incidents

Most companies have some restrictions
I don't take for granted whatever freedom given to me.
When a freedome is taken away, I tend to have an adjustment problem. 
I remember GS .. blogger was blocked.

-- fuxi: use both k_twister_SMS and t_selfTalk .. a new model for overlap-tagging
Better than two overlapp tags (ugly proliferation)

Need an explanation bpost .. perhaps use one of the t_selfTalk bposts.

-- "fuxi x 2" means Dram refreshed twice
