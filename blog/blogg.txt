Q: how many tags would be too many in a blog?
A 500?

why I can have up to 5 times more tags than categories?
Tags are not presented in a super-long list of checkboxes. Tags are selected by autocomplete

Overlapping tags is a bigger problem than an excessive number of distinct tags

nowadays post title, tag/category are more impotant than post content

-- fuxi: A299 where
Needed on the go? mostly for git-blogging

-- fuxi: at Mapic, some would spend the precious break time networking or asking questions.
I learn a lot from my reflective blogg afterwards, mostly at home.

One keyword or one key question often starts a new train of thought.

--fuxi wp super cache
too complex. Even if I turn it off for a year, and feel safe to turn in back on, I would still forget it is there. Forgetting means it would bite me.

i think caching is designed for large user base. I have a user base of 1.

--fuxi: excessive blogg@@
part of my current comfortable ezlife is plenty of spare time for blogging. Satisfying, rewarding, but at the cost of tech xx pace, parenting, localSys

dhost panel->support->dataCenters has a technical and definitive listing of all my web sites (identified by FQDN), all my databases, all my ssh user accounts.
