Is reading about parenting (and marriage, inter-personal communications) less likely to make a real difference? Yes, blogging about personal reflections are more introspective, more personal.

-- update bpost on proliferation
.. My adaptations to the proliferation problem:
more deletion of outdated bposts
git blogging now uses more Update less New
more time spent on fuxi using PubDate adjustment and less time spent creating new bposts
more comments in bpost titles.. In some cases, post title, tag/category are more impotant than the (brief) post content
"fuxi" entries in git blog .. see bpost

-- slow-cooking new blog/wiki^recoll
Active scratchpads can be implemented as a wiki, or a file in a recoll directory tree.

A wiki (including my blog) is first and foremost an info display system, so you can keep a page open forever, as one of 20 open browser tabs. If needed, you could start an hour-long edit session, but eventually, you must save and publish. Most of the time the document is in Published mode, not Edit mode.

A recoll is data storage. The Edit GUI and Display GUI are the same thing, not separate as on a web browser. Therefore, we don't display a recoll file forever because there is a real risk of unwanted edit when we don't know how to roll back.

A recoll has more flexible organization. A wiki tree is kinda similar, but my blog is not. My blog relies on categories and tags.

--fuxi wp super cache
too complex. Even if I turn it off for a year, and feel safe to turn in back on, I would still forget it is there. Forgetting means it would bite me.

i think caching is designed for large user base. I have a user base of 1.
