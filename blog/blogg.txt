-- new: ##ways@link`blogposts
Linking is essential in web content. 

Linking in my blog is high value and high tcost. We need to keep improving on the process. There are currently 3 ways to link 2 "related" blogposts.

* categories and tags .. proliferation breeds confusion, artificial complexities..

* links of various forms
** opaque URL
** "see also the blogpost on xxx"
** underlined phrase

When I feel the need for two-way linking, I often merge the posts into one big post.
I think it's OK to have two separate big sections, possibly overlapping. No need to consolidate.

* a big blogpost with multiple sections cross-referencing. There are often memorable alias posts pointing to such a big blogpost.

* journalist taking notes for future publication use
* taking personal notes for my own review

--fuxi: excessive blogg@@
part of my current comfortable ezlife is plenty of spare time for blogging. Satisfying, rewarding, but at the cost of tech xx pace, parenting, localSys

A related consequence -- as I reduce online blogg, I get a growing backlog in git-blog.

-- fuxi: tag names ending in __
When browsing my blog in the admin interface, sometimes I have to quickly tag a blog as "perhaps belonging to tag3". I tried "tag3@@" and "tag3?" and realized I must use "tag3_@"

Afterwards, I could go to the tag listing and identify these "temporary tags" and clean up.

dhost panel->support->dataCenters has a technical and definitive listing of all my web sites (identified by FQDN), all my databases, all my ssh user accounts.
