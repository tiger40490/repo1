tcost: updating existing bpost .. obligation to find the most relevant bpost. After that, often need to integrate new content into existing.
tcost: creating brand new bpost... obligation to choose category/tags and draft good title
tcost: noisy wpress search /against/ increased blog content; overcrowded category/tags

When I have too much content in git-blog, a recommendation is ... disposable blogg i.e. expressive, reflective, therapeutic writing in git-blog (or wpress), and later move content into those fuxi_*.txt files

Email with friends .. is an exemplification of such reflective writing. "Thrown away" into gmail archive. better tcosts.
Eg: in early 2024, I did such an reflective writing on "adaptable retirement". These emails are kinda worth a dramRefersh once a while,  but ... Should they go into my blog as four-liners? Only a selected few.

Need to go through the fuxi_* files once a while or they would keep growing

split fuxi_ files by subject

We can search for "The backup of this post in your browser is different from the version below" in ssh. Once we locate the file, we can try to disable it.

-- fuxi or update bpost on site blocked
I AM flexible. In the face of growing site blocks at end of 2023, I have taken things in my stride.

I recognize that the recent site blocks are less alarming/sensitive/harmful/toxic, less incriminating ,,, than those compliance incidents

Most companies have some restrictions
I don't take for granted whatever freedom given to me.
When a freedome is taken away, I tend to have an adjustment problem. 
I remember GS .. blogger was blocked.
