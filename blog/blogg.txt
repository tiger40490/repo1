Hi Xinghe,

My company has a new policy that bans all wordpress editing/posting. They don't explicitly ban reading or printing of blogs, including my own blogs.

I hope to find a "readonly" webpage-forward online service, say aa351.com. On the webpage, I put in any URL (to my own blog), and aa351 will download the page in html, and render it.

This will help me with printing my blog content from office. It will also help me copy content from my own blog (like tech tips) while working in office.

The URL will require no log-in. 

An image on the original web page can be unavailable, if the image URL is blocked by company firewall. I don't need those images.

A CSS may also become unavailable. I will see how bad the webpage looks like without CSS.

If no such online service, I will consider creating it for myself. Technically easy. I will need hosting though. Can you help with hosting?

-- update bpost on site block
I AM flexible. In the face of growing site blocks at end of 2023, I have taken things in my stride.

I recognize that the recent site blocks are less alarming/sensitive/harmful/toxic, less incriminating ,,, than those compliance incidents

painting is known to be therapeutic. So is playing/singing music. My expressive writing is even more effective but it's not as immediate+80%+dramatic like my ED pill. Sometimes the effect is underwhelming. That's part of life.

-- fuxi or update bpost on site blocked
Most companies have some restrictions
I don't take for granted whatever freedom given to me.

When a freedome is taken away, I tend to have an adjustment problem. 
I remember GS .. blogger was blocked.

-- fuxi: 
Frequently, I find some bposts worth reviewing, but it's hard to know which bpost.
t_fuxi tags, sticky flag are proven helpful, although not extremely. 

Need to invest more time learning ctbz in titles.

sugg: when too many STICKY posts, can we archive some to PendingRefresh ? Yes
