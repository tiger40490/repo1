--fuxi: excessive blogg@@
part of my current comfortable ezlife is plenty of spare time for blogging. Satisfying, rewarding, but at the cost of tech xx pace, parenting, localSys

A related consequence -- as I reduce online blogg, I get a growing backlog in git-blog.

taking note of a memorable conversation: I tend to confuse two modes

* journalist taking notes for potential publication use. This mode often provides active recreation, and keeps my vocab and my mind active, even improving.
* taking personal notes for my own review

-- fuxi: tag names ending in __
When browsing my blog in the admin interface, sometimes I have to quickly tag a blog as "perhaps belonging to tag3". I tried "tag3@@" and "tag3?" and realized I must use "tag3_@"

Afterwards, I could go to the tag listing and identify these "temporary tags" and clean up.
