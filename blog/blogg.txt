-- new: tag names ending in __
When browing my blog in the admin interface, sometimes I have to quickly tag a blog as "perhaps belonging to tag3". I tried "tag3@@" and "tag3?" and realized I must use "tag3__"

Afterwards, I could go to the tag listing and identify these "temporary tags" and clean up.

-- new or fuxi: I like titles with a power phrase or a sharp question. 
These blogposts follow the news journalist tradition, and tries to analyze the given topic from various angles.

These titles are the best solution to the proliferation of blog posts.

--fuxi: 
dhost panel->support->dataCenters has a technical and definitive listing of all my web sites (identified by FQDN), all my databases, all my ssh user accounts.
