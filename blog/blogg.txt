--fuxi
the "fuxi" entries in git blogg is crucial. Before this change, I had to decide how to handle such content. 
The content is not worthless, to be deleted, but publishing it would require either too many low-value bposts, or too much legwork updating existing bposts.

Therefore, the growing "fuxi" content is a necessary evil, and something of an asset

single-category doctrine?

Q: how many tags would be too many in a blog?
A 500?

why I can have up to 5 times more tags than categories?
Tags are not presented in a super-long list of checkboxes. Tags are selected by autocomplete

Overlapping tags is a bigger problem than a proliferation of distinct tags

In some cases, post title, tag/category are more impotant than post content

Needed on the go? mostly for git-blogging.

The more I bring out the L36, the faster its wear-n-tear.

too complex. Even if I turn it off for a year, and feel safe to turn in back on, I would still forget it is there. Forgetting means it would bite me.

i think caching is designed for large user base. I have a user base of 1.
