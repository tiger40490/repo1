-- new: promote throwaway blogging
tcost: updating existing bpost .. obligation to find the most relevant bpost. After that, often need to integrate new content into existing.
tcost: creating brand new bpost... obligation to choose category/tags and draft good title
tcost: noisy wpress search /against/ increased blog content; overcrowded category/tags

When I have too much content in git-blog, a recommendation is ... throwaway blogg i.e. expressive, reflective, therapeutic writing in git-blog (or wpress), and later move content into those fuxi_*.txt files

Email with friends .. is an exemplification of such reflective writing. "Thrown away" into gmail archive. better tcosts.

Eg: in early 2024, I did such an reflective writing on "adaptable retirement". These emails are kinda worth a dramRefersh once a while,  but ... Should they go into my blog? 

-- fuxi or update bpost on site blocked
I AM flexible. In the face of growing site blocks at end of 2023, I have taken things in my stride.

I recognize that the recent site blocks are less alarming/sensitive/harmful/toxic, less incriminating ,,, than those compliance incidents

Most companies have some restrictions
I don't take for granted whatever freedom given to me.
When a freedome is taken away, I tend to have an adjustment problem. 
I remember GS .. blogger was blocked.

-- fuxi: 
Frequently, I find some bposts worth reviewing, but looking at title, it's hard to know which specific bposts are.
t_fuxi tags, sticky flag are proven helpful, although not extremely. 

Need to invest more time learning ctbz in titles.

sugg: when too many STICKY posts, can we archive some to PendingRefresh ? Yes
