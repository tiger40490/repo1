-- le2 Raymond: my coping strategies
What are some of my coping strategies for anxiety (most common in me), worries (2nd most common), tensions, conflicts.

In the final 5 minutes of our CompassOne chat, I named 3 main strategies.
* workout
* therapeutic blogging
* quiet time away from family but not in solitude .. during the quiet time I could study, blog, read or take a few minutes of rest and watch people passing by.

I will add a few specific but minor coping strategies
* longer sleep .. if-and-only-if I feel pysically tired due to stress.
* reading vacation .. pick up some magazines or books (printed, not on screen) of interest. Each person tends to have a wide range of interests. A engaging read can serve as diversion.
* work on company projects .. can serve as diversion. It also reduces pressure from work.

Some coping strategies I have not found very effective for me
* drinking and eating .. I do eat a controlled amount of comfort foods such as ice cream or nuts when I feel over-stretched. Generally not very effective.
* talk to friends .. I realize that my friends are mostly too busy to listen to me in-depth. Sometimes I call a counselling hotline, if I have a specific question such as parenting or spouse communication or workplace issue.
* movies .. not effective diversion though I go to cinemas about 3 times a month, always alone. However, sometimes I sit outside the cinema hall (if seating available) for 3 hours after the movie to get some quiet time.
* gaming, watch sports, music .. 
* gardening, hiking .. sounds like a good diversion but never tried.

specific, memorable names

--fuxi: excessive blogg@@
part of my current comfortable ezlife is plenty of spare time for blogging. Satisfying, rewarding, but at the cost of tech xx pace, parenting, localSys

A related consequence -- as I reduce online blogg, I get a growing backlog in git-blog.

taking note of a memorable conversation: I tend to confuse two modes

* journalist taking notes for potential publication use. This mode often provides active recreation, and keeps my vocab and my mind active, even improving.
* taking personal notes for my own review

-- fuxi: tag names ending in __
When browsing my blog in the admin interface, sometimes I have to quickly tag a blog as "perhaps belonging to tag3". I tried "tag3@@" and "tag3?" and realized I must use "tag3_@"

Afterwards, I could go to the tag listing and identify these "temporary tags" and clean up.
