Q: how many tags would be too many in a blog?
A 500?

why I can have up to 5 times more tags than categories?
Tags are not presented in a super-long list of checkboxes. Tags are selected by autocomplete

Overlapping tags is a bigger problem than a proliferation of distinct tags

too complex. Even if I turn it off for a year, and feel safe to turn in back on, I would still forget it is there. Forgetting means it would bite me.

i think caching is designed for large user base. I have a user base of 1.

part of my current comfortable ezlife is plenty of spare time for blogging. Satisfying, rewarding, but at the cost of tech xx pace, parenting, localSys
