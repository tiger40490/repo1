-- le2K.Hu: some of the "important" py features IMHO
I don't know if interviewers perceive them as important and worth asking.

* large scale multiprocessing
* compute farm
* hack into the import mechanism
* decorators
* immutable types
* serialization
* various introspection techniques

Every time I resolve to invest in python self-study beyond what's required at work, my enthusiasm usually dies down rather quickly. Why? I always felt the return on investment was quite unproven. Interviewers may not care about my favorite topics, and work projects are unlikely to need these skills.

QH.Dong mentioned passion and personal interest outside work.
I had some passion and spent lots of personal time on py, sockets, shell scripting, swing,,,

The JIV demands a lot of us!
-- fuxi or update bpost on feel`satisfied more than peers
in the nightmare, I was dismissed once again by Macq. 
I did my best but again was the weakest in the team.

In hind sight, the job requirement was simply too high.

How about AshS in his CTO job? CSDoctor's job? S.Liu's job? YY.Tao's job?

If I were to benchmark myself with so-called peers, try to increase my brank, and join the exclub, I would get derailed, lose my carefree ezlife, take on lots of stress. 
If I try, could I become an architect? Not my strength.
If I try, could I become a lead developer like Ash.S? Not sure. Ash.S seems to take on too much.

At my age, I have an implicit self-conviction that most of the higher-paying positions are too stressful, with exorbitant expectation.
What I'm unsure is the salary spread. What additional income is possible? After tax, 100k/Y additional? Not worth it.

I told grandpa that my successE [carefree ezlife + harmony, based on wellness and comfortable livelihood] is rare among my cohort, not because I'm better off than them, but because I don't focus on the wrong goals.

The nightmare scenario is much more severe than CB2022
-- update or new: Street dance ^ eGaming ^ speed coding
Street ddance skill can't make money for you.
Singing is similar.
Piano is similar but .... can teach... There's ia good demand.

basketball talent .. Top 0.1% can make money

Speed coding is very different. Many companies are interest in hiring you.

Many guys can GTD like monkey coding. Many medical guys can treat ailments.

The six-figure SWE jobs require a level of expertise like physicians.

if I lose MLP job and decide to remain in SG, I would face a much smaller finDev job pool with too many competitors. The buy-side jobs would be too demanding, age-unfriendly. The crypto jobs would be age-unfriendly. The ibank jobs would be much fewer than in WSt. I would have poor job choices like Qz and OC job.

Chinese immigrants in Canada probably want to work in U.S. just as U.S. tech students want to work in WsC

I heard a departing colleague's truthful reflections including the reasons for the departure. One of the reasons is related to comp benchmark. I guess (with good level of confidence) that he feels that given his value-add and effort, he should receive $XX more (whatever XX is).

The more one dwells on it, the more one would feel unfair -- Someone else in the same team has the same level of value-add but was rewarded much more.

It's a valuable protection that I don't put in extra effort and sacrifice for the manager. It protects me from the hazard of harmful comparision. 

At my age, I don't salary-benchmark as much as in my 30s -- I don't care so much about wasting my potential, my spare capacity. It's good and bad. 

It's bad if I am chronically underpaid (20% below market) like J.Zhang.
It's good if my employer and my manager is generous and keen to retain older devs like me.
