--new: Am I driven2master localSys@@ 
I think a dose (not fixation) of negative motivation (fear) is needed. 

I think I wasn't at mvea. At RTS I lost the steam after a while. 

What's my vague definition of mastering? Perhaps I did master the pspc module?

[1] I would say yes at catcha, empworld, zed, Strategem, RTS. Perhaps yes at Chartered,
