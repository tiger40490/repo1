Most people who claim an expertise do have some expertise, even if exaggerated slightly. Most audience won't bother to verify the credentials.

My UChicago GPA is 100% authentic. In a fast-moving market, credibility and assurance from known-brands matter. Probably needed it in a declining phase of my career. It's insurance protection for my career.

My java/c++ QQ knowledge is not advanced expertise, but is enough to pass many external benchmarks.

For all my career esp. after 35, my competitive strengths in theoretical + details are evergreen and vital advantages in tech IV.

Performance (including bigO, but excluding field turning) is all about details.

In contrast, speed coding is less of "my game". It is like a sprint race for a footballer.
