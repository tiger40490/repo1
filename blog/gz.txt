-- new or udpate "fast developers"
Q: can you imagine a fast doctor (perhaps travelling with an soldiers) who treats lots of wounds but has a 1% error rate? If some of the errors are severe then he is disqualified and unreliable.

Q: can you imagine a restaurant chef very fast with his work, but once a while, produces a dish with salt omitted, causing complaints? If too frequent, then she is disqualified.

In SWE profession, we often say that if there's an well-known error-prone coder, and we constantly worry about him producing buggy code, then we would rather not have him coding. The threshold of "too many missteps" depends on frequency and severity. 

A key factor is personal reputation. 

I tend to write more documentation than fellow SWE. The act of writing and rewriting detailed docs enhances my awareness of (personal) blindspots, hidden areas, edge cases. Those docs that are written for a wider audience would receive more attention from me the author.  

Across a /structured/ codebase, I tend to bend over backward to enforce consistency. Inconsistency is breeding ground for bugs, so this habit can flush out some bugs.

A smaller habit is naming variables, functions and classes. I spend lots of time naming them precisely and consistently. That forces me to slow down and pay attention to some details in the logic.

All of these personal habits above slow me down, but they tend to protect my personal reputation and reduce those embarrassing or disastrous/devastating bugs.

-- new: XiaoYan meet-up
XiaoYan is a kind lady. I guess she decided to spend 1.5 hours learning about the world outside PSA, and sharing experiences and observations. As I told her, this meet-up turned out to be an insightful, reflective career counselling session. She was a helpful mirror. I revealed a lot of my fears, setbacks, weaknesses,,, and received substantial support.

She suggested that job stability could become a G3 priority for my next job search in Singapore. PSA and OC are profitable and stable places -- management are extremely reluctant to retrench, even for non-performing employees.

She shared that age concern over a 55-year-old candidate (8-Y career runway ) is a real concern at hiring discussions.

She mentioned a long-term contract staff.. capable and quiet but PSA was not keen to convert such contractors to perm because removing any perm staff is always costly and painful. Sounds like employers like PSA and OC would always wait for non-performing employees to resign, including employees with bad attitude.

I reveald that my salary is now "very high" by my standard, possibly overpaid, so much so that I don't mind buying her an expensive juice. She pointed out that unlike many people in such overpaid/underworked situations, I'm conscientious about the possibility of "overpaid without heavy workload or contribution". Deep inside, I felt a warm pat on the back.

On the other hand, many people in the same firm feel underpaid as a group. This is similar to Americans feeling bad about their education systems or Sgrns feeling bad about natioal housing condition. If indeed I'm underpaid relative to the industry, then the above-mentioned "overpaid" concern is not a serious risk.

She asked why I prefer SGP to U.S. if I could find an equivalent after-tax salary (after adjusting for cost of living). I mentioned close-to-grandparents, Chinese population (better for wife), better government support, weather,,, I forgot to mention driving, street safety, wife's career.

I realized that as I age I have become more loyal, less opinionated,,,,, but I still reject the widespread advice to "put up with worsening job situation for as long as you can tolerate"

-- update https://btv-gz.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=45147&action=edit

The unexpected success vindicates my (project) delivery, my tech capabilities, my attitudes, my interpersonal communications,,,, 

However, I still perceive this job as an exception in my career. In the next job, I foresee challenges/weaknesses/fault-lines on all of those fronts. In those jobs, if and when I feel bad about myself, I need to believe that "At least in one job I was considered good." In fact, I exceeded expectations in RTS, 95G, Barc, Mvea but those jobs had no bonus.

Is EPA job a black swan? Acutally not.

-- fuxi or update ...: 
Whether we use tbl or Genepai, I would have a relatively comfortable timeline... Am lucky.

when I feel stressed about Genepai progress, I can feel relieved that the two full-time young devs didn't find a better solution than mine.

Apparently, there's no yardstick to guage progress.
However, Genepai made enough progress (albeit small) to /earn/ multiple business trips between Sgp and NYC.

The deliverable is a dream. If you show effort and make *some* progress, then they would probably reward you for trying.

Other AI projects in EqTech rarely have any full-time devs. 

Every challenge in Genepai is my problem, but the 2 of them are supposed to help out, so it's fine to delegate to them, while I design high-level things and take on modules that are hard to delegate.

If one of them becomes better than me and more productive than me, that can be a good thing. Manager should not penalize me.

If they become independent and can contribute productively, I think managers would be delighted.
