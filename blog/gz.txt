-- new: respect not tied2peer-benchmarking
Nothing much new, but a useful revision.

I told a Cigna counsellor, what's really important to my job satisfaction is respect, but the elephant in the room ... is benchmarking.

GS is the most direct experience. Respect from manager, peers, users and even self-respect is mostly based on benchmarking within your own team, and within the bigger department.
My ErrorMemos user in Texas gave me exceed, perhaps based on his past experience with other developers. Yet my manager found me nothing spectacular.

Users and External peers and users may not know what the other team members are able to achieve *if put in my shoes* so no benchmark per se. Yet these evaluators have an expectation and based on it, a level of respect to you

.. Among performing artists (and visual, literal artists), some artists are loved by their audience, but Question: what about the ranking? 
My answer: the ranking doesn't matter to their audience. If I'm an audience of a particular writer, composer, singer ... then I see unique value in her, regardless of the ranking chart.

.. students in general
My kids don't need to be outstanding to learn useful things and have a meaningful experience in school
Excellence is measured on personal growth. This is within the student's circle of control.

.. researchers like my dad

.. my piano practice and yoga .. is a different form of "respect". I exceed my limitations and my inertia and I derive various benefits, all without benchmarking.

-- new: refresh: localSys^QQ^blog
limited memory capacity, unable to hold everything in L1 cache. Some content must fetch from disk.

* top 200 of the nontech blogposts -- refresh is time-consuming
* QQ, CIV pearls -- need to focus on the evergreen, xref and thick->thin
** learn new pearls? LGlp unless it gets linked in via xref. 
* localSys -- I never really allocate enough time on refresh. Maybe I should.

--new baby post: winUpdate : unavoidable annoyance
The windowsUpdate problem is AA) recurring BB) without simple and reliable solution CC) irritating to ME 

The only solution I found so far is landGrab. I felt silly to spend hours setting up the tools to support landGrab. zsms! The zsms is annoying to say the least.

.. coding drill
I feel CSY's view on coding practice is similar in that he probably feels silly to spend months on it, but he just couldn't find any better solution to this huge and immediate problem. 

In contrast, Deepak has a positive attitude. Some may say that over 3 years, Deepak won't improve to get ahead of CSY, but who are we to judge. Life is full of surprises. Deepak will improve as long as he keeps up the practice, and someday he will get lucky. 

In theory, someone who doesn't practice can also get lucky, but I don't believe it. This is my bias towards hard work. Luck favors the deligent like Deepak

Actually, my windowsUpdate situation is better than CSY's situation, becasue I have a working solution.

.. When living in the U.S. Driving is a big, unavoidable problem. I will choose to live in walkable communities with subway. Look at Beijing and SG, perhaps also HK

.. boys' phone addiction and weight are unavoidable problems.

My PIP experience was truly traumatic with permant scars, but my benchtime experiences were extremely light in comparison:

* before Polaris
* between 95G and Barcap
* between RTS and mvea
