-- java is better...
the core lang is more stable than c#, and also c++ in terms of IV topics

Even though jee job market is volatile, the coreJava job market enjoys robust demand.

My strength in low-level details is far more valuable in java than py, perl, SQL etc.

compared to c++, cdd/job ratio is not very different, but the java cdd pool is low-quality. In coreJava, I can easily stand out.

-- c++ displaced [C, cobol, Delphi, VB...] before java diplaced c++. Now java market share is eroded by js and py.

losing to py in data-centric systems.
losing to js in web apps. Many features are moving from server side to client side. 

--QQ learning: books beat websites
books support much easier refresh, annotation.
Most of my peers don't prefer books, but I find my learning pace significantly better with books, so this is my competitive advantage.

-- update one of the blogposts on appraisal
as employee, when I have family issues, kids issues, investment foes, I would fear an appraisal. Even a bonus disappointment would add a heavy blow.

As contractor, no such fear. When I'm let go, I would easily attribute it to budget and go job hunting again.

--fuxi: wq.l felt govtech is not a technology laggard. He is attracted by that and the job stability. 
Work load is not lighter than elsewhere in his experience. However, I would say many private employers are more aggressive more pushing more ruthless.

Is age a problem? wq.l felt yes because the younger developers have more flexibility in salary requirement. However, I feel the younger dev also has an expectation of rising income. Any signs any evidence that "My career may not be as promising as thought, not growing as fast as my cohort" tend to be devastating. In other words, the older dev is allowed to be slower, mediocre, more low-energy (as I told Sachin).

--fuxi web2.0 is a good phrase for a vague and broad category. Remarkably, It has not received any criticism and has stood the test of time

--informal feedbacks during year-end party
"You are process oriented, which is missing in the local team. We are not used to so many questions so we ignored some of your questions. We assume each team member has maturity and needs only a pointer and can figure out the rest." In zed I used to feel the same about asking questions, but in GS it all changed. 

* Kevin -- "needs some guidance"
* Gary -- needs to speak out. Not taking initiative to show leadership.
* Anurag -- very sharp guy, but i think he is fast at the expense of quality. Nevertheless, he is probably very sharp.

It's really dangerous to openly talk about other team members in front of other people whom we may not know so well.
These 2 guys are sophisticated but I think their habit is quite reckless. 
However, if we don't take this opportunity now, then we may not know how we think of each other.

I was rather bold when talking about Anurag in public. I think that might be the first unsafe comment of the night.

--fuxi: smart guys like Kun.h couldn't crack the quant IV cos
* too selective, comparable to HFT
* poor market depth. I guess Kun ended in a risk quant role.
