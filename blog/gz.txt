For all my career esp. after 35, my competitive strengths in theoretical + details are evergreen advantages in tech IV.

speed coding is less advantageous for me.

Programming is all about details.

After hibernation, first few years in the U.S. quite possibly my stress level (and wife's) would grow.

Would a contract job or a VP job give me stress relief? Clearly, contract job feels lighter, despite the lower salary and lower job security.

my daily sense of "good work" depends mostly on 
AA) visible output
BB) my own sacrifice, sometimes invisible. Factors inlucde the amount of hours I spend in office

Without BB, sometimes I feel a bit guilty, but usually I feel proud of myself.

--new or update blogpost on bonus?
Bonus is only one person’s appraisal of my value-add, attitude, ...
Therefore, my own self-assessment and self-esteem can reference that but only as a small factor. It’s very dangerous to tie my self-esteem to this single factor. People can and do care too much about this one factor.

Bonus amount is heavily influenced by the base salary. Low bonus could still mean a high total comp compared to teammates.

In many places (Macq, GS,,, ) I actually cared to do a good job for the boss and for the firm, but still failed to impress the boss. In such a context, I must contain the damage of that appraisal, or risk ruining my self-esteem and motivation at work.
