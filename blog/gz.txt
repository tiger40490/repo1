In my view, the main threats to my job are
1) Compliance 2) quality 
You probably agree that project completion speed is not an issue in itself, but you felt idleness can be recorded and used against me when layoff pressure builds up. A boss would protect those subordinates doing a good enough job and not making trouble. Being idle half the time is not always embarrassing. Many people in many teams are also idle for days and weeks. 
I did ask a colleague (and close friend) "Who are on the so-called good list? Who are on the not-so-good list and therefore at risk in a downturn?" He felt I was not at risk. For job security, I believe the best indicators are 1) year-end numbers 2) continuous feedback. These two vital signs are both stable/strong for the past 2 years, so I don't worry about job security.

It's hard to quantify idleness
* some workers are  efficient and need only 10% of the budgeted time to finish a project. That's not an issue in itself.  This person should not affect colleagues' productivity.* chitchat.. hours of (non-work) chitchat with colleagues can be part of "relationship building"... Is that idleness?* quality is not captured in any "quantifying" system, but quality is arguably more important (to users, to the company) than idleness/busy-ness.* wasted work is not captured in any "quantifying" system. In many shops, a lot of engineer man-days are spent building products that nobody uses in the end. These engineers are not idle but * some (like me) spend hours in the office on weekends. X number of those weekend hours are spent on work projects, but I don't remember how many and the company doesn't record either, as far as I know.* Each person is assigned a company iPhone. When outside the office, we often use this iPhone for office email or Slack chat. I don't remember how many hours

-- slow cooking new: employee benefits: addicted
Trigger event: move the CapitaSpring the fancy new office

Ever since I graduated and started work at local employers and small employers, I have witnessed increasingly /lavish/luxurious staff benefits. 
I often feel pampered, then self-pressured to "deliver" and "perform", to deserve these benefits.
As soon as you leave the firm (for whatever reasons) these luxuries disappear, unless next employer offer the same.

[[work a little less, live a little more]] described corporate high-fliers addicted to "busy-ness" [overworked, reliable and indispensible]. 
I guess these high-fliers grow (addicted and) reliant on many staff benefits to support their busy-ness: 

medical leave without MC requirement
medical consultation (cashless) at any clinic "close to wherever you are"
24H access to nice office (my harbor, my addiction)
flexible hours (my addiction)
remote connectivity from home + vacation
printing (my addiction)
extra monitors in office and home
unlimited IDD

-- slow-cooking new: Qz (^EPA) episode: inferiority-complex
t_selfEval
I had a deep-rooted inferiority complex across the q3SG perm jobs.
Therefore, before I started on EPA job, I braced myself for the same, and I was actively planning a return to U.S. within 2Y.

Q: How has my inferiority evolved? Note this self-eval question requires lots of Sys2 resources. Many individuals won't bother digging into the various factors (of inferiority) even though inferiority seriously affects our wellbeing.

Factor: appr by manager, in terms of comp numbers, relative importance in the team, and other things. This appr drives that inferiority complex.

Factor: localSys... is now slightly less important in the grand scheme of things. In StirtTech team, I was inferior in terms of localSys (which should have been accepted by mgr + the team). I couldn't follow a lot of the conversations. Mvea and EPA team... pretty much the same. 
(Aha) my EPA compensation is convincing evidence of manager's acceptance of my localSys.
Also, Sachin's localSys didn't earn much appr.

Factor: VP peer benchmark ... esp. in terms of localSys and value-add. Benchmark breeds inferiority. I have never wanted to be benchmarked with VPs. At RTS and Mvea, I was never benchmarked with VPs. In EPA, I try not to care or observe. I tell myself that we are all (informally) evaluated, all the time, by everyone but I'm older and less capable. I do that to fend off the inferiority.
