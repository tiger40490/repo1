-- new: y previous managers imposed heavier workload than Mvea|EPA
t_workload

I think most finDev shops are like my previous jobs.
Mvea and EPA are the exceptions.

In this bpost, I will try to be specific.
* prod support -- a major workload at GS. In contrast, mvea (and 95G) can rely on Josh as an efficient deep support. EPA prod support is mostly on other devs not me. Boss has no complaints. EPA also has QA to assist with many support issues. Effective Level2 support.
** Kyle said mvea is battle-tested for years, very stable, with minimal down time.
* QA assistance -- EPA, RTS, 95G (and mvea) had dedicated QA teams. I don't remember having to do QA work myself.

Above are superficial reasons. After GS, I find that most employers allocate a few times more manpower for the same workload.

Many finDevs complain about demanding users (or the sheer amount of work). 
That's 一叶障目. (I have written numerous bposts on it.) 
Many other shops have similar levels of "demand" but those shops simply hire more devs, or prioritize half the projects to next quarter. 
(One Singaporean interviewer in a WSt shop told me dev managers need a backbone and stand up to business.) 
So user demand is the excuse of tech bosses to apply pressure on subordinates. 
I think many business users in my current (2022) compoany are not so demanding as GS users, but many managers (eg: managerX) here still apply pressure on subordinates. 
What’s the underlying difference between managerX and EPA manager? 
Fundamentally, I think it has to do with managerX’s attitude on project cost control.

* project cost control -- PWM is the most decisive example... They track project cost in dev man-day. In contrast, with these 2 teams the manager doesn't seem to care that much about my man-day costs to the business. Now I think PWM business was struggling to turn a profit, and prove the viability of their business model.
* Boss ambition -- somehow, each manager at these 2 places doesn't increase (team-level) workload to justify his personal value-add. (EPA boss could say that team workload is already very high after 3 departures.) In contrast, look at PWM, RTS, Barc, Macq, Stirt, OC

-- slow-cooking new: Qz (^EPA) episode: inferiority-complex
t_selfEval
I had a deep-rooted inferiority complex across the q3SG perm jobs.
Therefore, before I started on epa job, I braced myself for the same, and I was actively planning a return to U.S. within 2Y.

Q: How has my inferiority evolved? Note this self-eval requires lots of Sys2 resources. Many people won't bother digging into the various factors of inferiority even though it seriously affects their wellbeing.

Factor: appr by manager, in terms of comp numbers, relative importance and other things. This appr drives that inferiority complex

Factor: localSys... is now slightly less important. In StirtTech team, I was inferior in terms of localSys (which should be accepted by mgr + the team). I couldn't follow a lot of the conversations. Mvea and EPA team... pretty much the same. 
(Aha) my EPA compensation is convincing evidence of manager's acceptance of my localSys.
Also, Sachin's localSys didn't earn much appr.

Factor: VP peer benchmark ... esp. in terms of localSys and value-add. Benchmark breeds inferiority. I have never wanted to be benchmarked with VPs. At RTS and Mvea, I was never benchmarked with VPs. In EPA, I try not to care or observe. I tell myself that we are all (informally) evaluated, all the time, by everyone but I'm older and less capable. This is to fend off the inferiority.

-- LG2 update bpost on feel`satisfied more than peers
in a 2022 nightmare, I rejoined Macq and was dismissed again. 
I did my best but again was shown to be the weakest in the team, although another set of requirements may prove otherwise.

In hind sight, the job requirement was simply too high for me.
How about AshS in his CTO job? CSDoctor's job? S.Liu's job? YY.Tao's job?

If I were to benchmark myself with so-called peers, or try to increase my brank, and join the exclub, I would get derailed, lose my carefree ezlife, take on lots of stress. 
If I try, could I become a software architect? Not my strength.
If I try, could I become a lead developer like Ash.S? Not sure. 

At my age, I have an implicit self-conviction that most of the higher-paying positions are too stressful, with exorbitant expectation.
What I'm unsure is the salary increment. What additional income is possible? After tax, 100k/Y additional? Not worth it.

I told grandpa that my successE [carefree ezlife + harmony, based on wellness and comfortable livelihood] is rare among my cohort, not because I'm wealthier than them, but because I don't focus on the wrong goals.

The nightmare scenario is much more severe, harsh, harmful than CB2022.

-- LG2 update or new: Street dance ^ eGaming ^ speed coding
Street dance skill can't make money for you.
Singing is similar.
Piano is similar but .... can teach... There's a good demand.

basketball talent .. Top 0.1% can make money

Speed coding is very different. Many companies are interested to hire you.

if I lose MLP job and decide to remain in SG, I would face a much smaller finDev job pool with too many competitors. The buy-side jobs would be too demanding, age-unfriendly. The crypto jobs would be age-unfriendly. The ibank jobs would be much fewer than in WSt. I would have less-than-ideal job choices like Qz and OC job.

-- slow-cooking new: career insecurity: 2017 watershed
t_vague
2017 marked a watershed in my sense of career insecurity.
Before the watershed, I had a learned insecurity, instilled in me due to decades of brainwash, and internalized.

churn defeating any attempt of accumulation
The widespread and entrenched notion that "Few can remain hands-on till 40."
threat from younger or stronger competitors.
dRam refresh and maintain my critical mass
strengthen my moat
Don't drop out from the leading pack.

I felt like the EDB -- can't afford to slow down, due to the risk of getting outrun/outmaneuvered, or caught up, the risk of losing our relevance.

After the watershed, I could see the end of my forced marathon, planning my own light marathon. 
Therefore, for the remainder of the race I could afford to slow down to a stroll, drop out of the leading pakc, and let other people overtake me.
