-- fuxi: early to office?
CTO knows (lucky me) I'm in 6-7 days a week, and my personal attendance record could be "right at the top".

CTO has no specific "latest" like 10am. Verbally, he said 10am is a reasonable reference. He recognizes our night meetings. I said 9, 10, 11am and he had no issues.

Trust is key. Trust from senior management in the Sgp team.

Sgp team's privileges may be taken away if our attendance record becomes unacceptable/subpar/. Also, the three rows outside his office can become completely empty in some mornings.

CTO felt that most people are sensible but a few bad apples might take advantage of their manager's physical abssence.

I don't want to lose my personal reputation or CTO's personal trust. I don't want to get on some radar. It's generally safe to spend some office hours on personal projects.

I can come in early on some days to "improve" my average. Before 8.30 would be good for train commute. I can be more confident in discussions.

-- fuxi: reality of temp jobs
I tend to perceive temp jobs positively, as learning.

many unlucky job seekers end up working on temp jobs. No job security, low pay, limited trec
eg: Chinese immigrants to Canada
eg: Shuo in 1997 after graduation
eg: my temp jobs in 2005
eg: many of the jobless 2023 graduates from China universities

If you don't worry about livelihood, then you can enroll in a training program instead.

-- new: gr8 application to own
Indispensible
complex but not too complex
complexity appreciated by mgr
central, not isolated .. FSV2, event handlers, 
My personal strength .. nothing in EPA 

-- fuxi
I feel overworked and not appreciated enough

Need to reduce actual work hours, while I maintain or even increase my quiet hours in office.

尽职尽责 .. tell boss I need to leave earlier and need more time for my projects

-- new or update bpost on opaque^transparency.. which bpost?
After you gain insight into an otherwise opaque system, then your job security and career security improves to some extent, depending on 

* How indispensible/crucial/central/redundant is that opaque system?
* Across industries, how widely used is that opaque system? Murex? Spring? Aeron? Majority of opaque systems are localSys
* rarity of your insight .. Are you a one-man show? VolFitter requires more math:)
* depth of your insight. 
* longevity of the opaque system and its accu and churn-resistance
* crying baby .. PMA takes up work hours and can let me demonstrate my knowledge and book my hours :) In contrast, Nautilus is not a crying baby :(

c++ is deeper and more opaque than java. Shell/perl/python are usually less opaque but python can become opaque as described in another bpost.

How about PMA? Not so opaque; indispensible; one-man show

-- fuxi or new: localSys ^ high-churn domains
portable t-investment .. zero for localSys 
engaging .. high-churn could be more exciting
market value .. zero for localSys

-- fuxi: I used to enjoy/exploit my perl/SQL/unix GTD "superpower"
I often find a secret killer skill in perl and shell as a power drill when facing a stone wall in project. 

advanced git is popular
shell scripting remains evergreen.
git-bash is useful for me, but not used by others
Nowadays advanced SQL is relevant only in places like PWM. Perl is only used for one-liners.
remote debugg .. Un-usalbe 50% the time when I need it. Live debugger is not as reliable as static command line tools.
One good use of remote debugging is .. revealing at least one way a method is used.
