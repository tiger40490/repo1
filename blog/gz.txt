In U.S. and increasing in SG, the traditional doctor/architect professions are now comparable to SWE profession.
However, a key difference is accu [including tech churn]. 

Many high-earning SWE must learn new tech 30 years into their career.
Some of these SWEs don't mind learning new tech or even enjoy learning new tech...

The WallSt coreJava contractor profession is a rare exception in terms of tech churn. 
This profession resembles the medical profession even better, if you throw in cpp, shell scripting, SQL, FIX, bondMath and other evergreen tech skills.
This description is probably biased, but I am hopeful and optmistic.

==new or update: ##unlisted capabilities for IV
Some of these unlisted requirements are more essential than listed ones, and disqualify many candidates, and represent my competitive advantages on a given job market.

-- capability: oral English skill .. some interviewers require a certian level of fluency, but that level is never listed explicitly.
-- capability: QQ .. [basic OO, basic algo, basic language nlg, basic number theory, ,] Actually, these are not basic, not used on the job for 20Y

-- capability: whiteboard
Most candidates are unused to whiteboard coding while explaining. 

Even harder when stuck and following hints from interviewer.

We are often rejected for ECT speed, or communication, or poor use of whiteboard real estate
-- capability: ECT, BP
The minimum standard is usually non-trivial, and requires practice.

-- take on student's role .. Josh mentioned the attitude of a student (even though he meant something else). If you were a reluctant student in school and only studied to pass exams and never "looked back", then you may find the dev interview process tough and challening. It requires you to go back into student mode. Specifically you have to review your past material + weaknesses, pick some topics, form some plan, study for weeks in your spare time, without a teacher.

I think this is one fundamental reason I feel stronger among my cohort.

A finance professional could claim that she can earn more in a year than a high-school classmate makes in 10Y, and it's not even an outlier year.

What we don't discuss is, the classmate (or accountant, engineer, RnD, nurse..) can grow her career and more or less maintain a salary for decades, often until retirement.

A trading career is much shorter, according to Kun.H and also a prop trader classmate. Older traders often need to step aside and become risk managers.

Career longevity provides inflation protection + meaningful engagement in old age, so I don't mind slightly lower lifetime income.

Most of my past techBets and tsn ... are likely to pay lower dividends after first 10Y. 
Strategic orgro is a holy grail.
We all have to be discretionary, cautious in our positioning.
I spend lots of time blgg about this.
Despite the underwhelming results of my techBets and tsn, we must not give up.
Applicable to Singapore government too. 
We need to decide what tech to take up and what to put off.

For the last 15Y, finDev IV is my chose game.
The 3 types of dnlg are still relevant.

There are many differences and a few similarities.

In terms of design skill, some developers peak at mid-30s to 50+. Depending on domain, accumulation and wisdom can help, but not as much as medical, sciences or teaching.

In terms of learning (various sub-domains), I feel some developers peak at 20 to 40+. It depends largely on foundation, interest, habit..

In terms of GTD, depending on the system and job role, some developers peak at 20 to 50+. It depends on habit, passion, dedication...

In terms of dnlg, I identified 3 types [lingo^math^arch]. These 3 types demand some level of interest, aptitude. Some developers peak at 30+ to 50+.

Sometimes we get into a new job and find a nasty manager (Yang to Roland), or long hours (PWM), or hard, uninspiring technology stack (Qz).

Some 10% just quit decisively within 6M, like Henry Fu. This route requires the key skill of IV.

The rest of us try to get used to the new job. Sometimes this proves to be patient, steady and effective.

Some 10%+ suffer in pain, like Sudhir (based on my limited knowledge) and my OC job.

Shi.Cheng hinted that interview prep is not his long-term mission. I think he wants to build zbs and grow on the tech ladder or the mgr ladder. German also said "it's hard to hire a decent tech lead or app owner".

I felt slightly ashamed. However, now I'm kinda mellowing up. Lead role comes with higher responsibility, higher stress, higher risk. Look at YW.Chen among others. The financial reward is not worth much. 

The risks to old-timer is easily underestimated. Their job security is tenuous.

-- where can I use this term?
tenuous(fragile) job security

NoSql is bigData, not DS/ML. 

Data Science probably favors python or R. ML is even less suitable for java.
ML includes classification, recommendation, ,, NeuralNetwork is part of ML

-- fuxi: for livelihood security (food security?) many governments are not so dependable, but some governments are better than employers. 

Jolt: However, In terms of financial support, government handout is tiny compared to employers' severance package.

-- fuxi: With 92S27 ex-classmates, I now can call myself a WallSt veteran techie, one of the most upstream sectors 
Evidence for "veteran"? Not GTD, not even zbs, but mostly the interview-visible expertise. 

This expertise is about the only criteria IMO. Anyone "strong" on this front is considered a veteran, regardless of his GTD, localSys....  Anyone weak on this front .. can still be a veteran, but with limited mobility.

A veteran developer doesn't need to be an above-average developer or expert developer but need to possess some demonstrable experience in the field. Therefore, a long stay in one team (Jack.Zhang?) is less valuable than multiple one-year projects.

Can you acquire this expertise with only 3Y experience? You would need to attend many interviews.
