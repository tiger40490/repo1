--new: c++toolChain: archaic for new coders #yoga
one of the most obvious and real limitation/obsolete features of c++ as a language is the tool chain.
Part of the ecosystem
Just like manual cars, too complicated compared to newer languages like java. The dynamic scripting languages are even simpler. 

Also an entry barrier. Young people can take it up if determined, but majority of them are put off. 

Q: A non-compSci graduate or an mid-career boot camp can take up programming in a scripting language or a simpler compiled language, but how many percent would take up c++? 

There's a minimum mileage required. Many young people don't stay on it long enough. 

My vi mileage is also too short.

Similarly, yoga is hard for most people but some individuals are determined and can overcome the initial hump (6-24M) and find joy and reward

In my early days using c++, I tried to set up eclipse CDT and spent lots of time on the tool chain. My goal was to set up similar convenience ... Futile. Not worthwhile. java tools are much better. Most c++ programmers don't bother with such convenience and rely on command line tools.

--jolt: imagine being Saurab or Sanjay. How did they cope with the PIP and "layoff"?
There's a lot I can learn from them.

--Q: Am I driven to master the localSys? I think a bit of negative motivation (fear) is needed. 

I think I wasn't at mvea. At RTS I lost the steam after a while. 

What's my vague definition of mastering? Perhaps I did master the pspc module?

[1] I would say yes at catcha, empworld, zed, Strategem, RTS. Perhaps yes at Chartered,
