Q: should I see the bonus handout as luck or "earned"? 
A: Neither. 

If I change my "self-script" [self-explanation, self-talk, self-description,,,] I could slowly change my P@R (perception of reality). Let's take TheRedPill, remove all the distortions we can, and see through the cold reality. 
Intuitively, I don't see this bonus as "earned". If you call it "Luck" then this luck is not random, not "earned" with hardwork, but more as karma (æžœ). My karma includes things like honesty, generosity, attention to details/documentation, kindness to "some" individuals, self-motivation about work and xx. It also shows when I Feel and talk abot "priviledged to work in this team."

A: many would attribute it to MLP or EPA team, or to my managers. These could be the most visible reasons, but I think this view might be superficial. 

A: it's potentially harmful to see it as entitled or earned, because it and the base salary are a privilege that can be taken away due to compliance or other reasons. Some may call it impermanance.

Q: should I attribute my high salary to my lifelong learning habit?
A: yes with my kids or any young people. I can find many objective, measurable facts and figures.
A: with peers outside finIT, I don't think so. Some may not be convinced anyway. My lifelong learning is evident, but the "causality" is not.

-- slow cooking new: employee benefits: addicted
Trigger event: move the CapitaSpring the fancy new office

Ever since I graduated and started work at local employers and small employers, I have witnessed increasingly /lavish/luxurious staff benefits. 
I often feel pampered, then self-pressured to "deliver" and "perform", to deserve these benefits.
As soon as you leave the firm (for whatever reasons) these luxuries disappear, unless next employer offer the same.

[[work a little less, live a little more]] described corporate high-fliers addicted to "busy-ness" [overworked, reliable and indispensible]. 
I guess these high-fliers grow (addicted and) reliant on many staff benefits to support their busy-ness: 

medical leave without MC requirement
medical consultation (cashless) at any clinic "close to wherever you are"
24H access to nice office (my harbor, my addiction)
flexible hours (my addiction)
remote connectivity from home + vacation
printing (my addiction)
extra monitors in office and home
unlimited IDD

-- slow-cooking new: Qz (^EPA) episode: inferiority-complex
t_selfEval
I had a deep-rooted inferiority complex across the q3SG perm jobs.
Therefore, before I started on EPA job, I braced myself for the same, and I was actively planning a return to U.S. within 2Y.

Q: How has my inferiority evolved? Note this self-eval question requires lots of Sys2 resources. Many individuals won't bother digging into the various factors (of inferiority) even though inferiority seriously affects our wellbeing.

Factor: appr by manager, in terms of comp numbers, relative importance in the team, and other things. This appr drives that inferiority complex.

Factor: localSys... is now slightly less important in the grand scheme of things. In StirtTech team, I was inferior in terms of localSys (which should have been accepted by mgr + the team). I couldn't follow a lot of the conversations. Mvea and EPA team... pretty much the same. 
(Aha) my EPA compensation is convincing evidence of manager's acceptance of my localSys.
Also, Sachin's localSys didn't earn much appr.

Factor: VP peer benchmark ... esp. in terms of localSys and value-add. Benchmark breeds inferiority. I have never wanted to be benchmarked with VPs. At RTS and Mvea, I was never benchmarked with VPs. In EPA, I try not to care or observe. I tell myself that we are all (informally) evaluated, all the time, by everyone but I'm older and less capable. I do that to fend off the inferiority.
