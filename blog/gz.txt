I heard a departing colleague's truthful reflections including the reasons for the departure. One of the reasons is related to comp benchmark. I guess (with good level of confidence) that he feels that given his value-add and effort, he should receive $XX more (whatever XX is).

The more one dwells on it, the more one would feel unfair -- Someone else in the same team has the same level of value-add but was rewarded much more.

It's a valuable protection that I don't put in extra effort and sacrifice for the manager. It protects me from the hazard of harmful comparision. 

At my age, I don't salary-benchmark as much as in my 30s -- I don't care so much about wasting my potential, my spare capacity. It's good and bad. 

It's bad if I am chronically underpaid (20% below market) like J.Zhang.
It's good if my employer and my manager is generous and keen to retain older devs like me.

With Sachin's informal numbers, credibility is rather low. He once said "anyone can get 200k base" but now he says 180k is pretty good as base.
-- new light-duty MD mgr job@@
mgr^contractor  
Q: are there senior mgr jobs that are low stress?
I used to think there are some. Now I think it's logically impossible. 

A senior mgr [like MD] is always responsible for a large budget and/or large team, typically 50+ people. Her decisions have a huge impact proportional to that responsibility. 

If he doesn't keep up with the flood of info, then how can he make those key decisions with confidence? 

Can she simply rely on his key subordinates + his relationships with clients/upper management. I don't believe that. Sounds too naive.

In 2021 parliament debate, some source hinted that regardless of the ruling party, the government will be able to run by itself thanks to a well-trained staff and optimized processes. PM Lee asserted that his ministers are key contributors and play key roles individually. High stress job for sure.

-- update: IT skills in-demand@@ Not senior level
During the covid19 pandemic, I told my neighbor that IT professionals are in-demand across SG, Mrs Anand said not in the senior management level.

I asked "So Mr Anand is not hands-on". His wife nodded.

-- update meaningful job.
in Parliament Q&A
Chan Chun Sing said that gov sector IT jobs are often more meaningful than a private sector job. I can say the same about nonprofit sector such as (non-commercial) schools. 

Public sector IT jobs also has more impact (on people's lives). Some jobs are essential, frontline. 

Combined, these sectors account for a sizable portion of the IT jobs in Singapore.

I hope these sectors are less competitive on salary and more age-friendly. Workload is not lower though.

Shi.Cheng hinted that interview prep is not his long-term mission. I think he wants to build zbs and grow on the tech ladder or the mgr ladder. German also said "it's hard to hire a decent tech lead or app owner".

I felt slightly ashamed. However, now I'm kinda mellowing up. Lead role comes with higher responsibility, higher stress, higher risk. Look at YW.Chen among others. The financial reward is not worth much. 

The risks to old-timer is easily underestimated. Their job security is tenuous.
Sometimes we get into a new job and find a nasty manager (Yang to Roland), or long hours (PWM), or hard, uninspiring technology stack (Qz).

Some 10% just quit decisively within 6M, like Henry Fu. This route requires the key skill of IV.

The rest of us try to get used to the new job. Sometimes this proves to be patient, steady and effective.

Some 10%+ suffer in pain, like Sudhir (based on my limited knowledge) and my OC job.

The last weekend of Oct 2021, I put in many hours 
* to add visualization
* to add more tests

Why? What's the motivation, j4 and ROTI? I asked the same question about MSFM, C#, Swing, quant self-study, python... I still don't have a good analytical framework. 

Key observation -- time won't stand still. It keeps flowing at a constant rate. Time can't be warehoused. If I don't spend my time on this coding practice, I would easily "waste" it on one of the energy sinks.

This coding drill has multiple benefits in hindsight
* the visualization emboldened me to engage Deepak, Daryl, Josh Lim, even my son. The "engagement" further enhances my "learning" .. various aspects
* my visualization is now barely usable for the "engagement", but if it is unusable, then my effort would still be a worthwhile effort. It reminds me of my pre-sales effort, my self-employment days... 
* I had a blogpost about  weekends otherwise wasted: G3 ROI@UChicago. Even if the code doesn't work, this is still zqbx. Without this zqbx, my ezlife feels decadent, wasteful and an incomplete success. 

My friends' effort and my own effort were not in vein. It restored my self-confidence as a c++ developer. The self-confidence is priceless.

-- fuxi: With 92S27 ex-classmates, I now can call myself a WallSt veteran techie, one of the most upstream sectors 
Evidence for "veteran"? Not GTD, not even zbs, but mostly the interview-visible expertise. 

This expertise is about the only criteria IMO. Anyone "strong" on this front is considered a veteran, regardless of his GTD, localSys....  Anyone weak on this front .. can still be a veteran, but with limited mobility.

A veteran developer doesn't need to be an above-average developer or expert developer but need to possess some demonstrable experience in the field. Therefore, a long stay in one team (Jack.Zhang?) is less valuable than multiple one-year projects.

Can you acquire this expertise with only 3Y experience? You would need to attend many interviews.
