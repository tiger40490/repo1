-- when I think of job security, bonus etc, I should ask myself

Q: In boss's perception, which dev is the most likely to quit?
Q: In boss's perception, which dev is likely the first to quit?

I hope that I'm seen as similar to the 2 NY old-timers. Total Comp may /plateau out/ but hopefully he would preserve the status quo, and protect team stability.

-- new: JIV topics: interviewer influence
When I was picking question to ask my candidates, I was influenced by ... ibank interviewers, HFT interviewers, and indirectly by web2.0 interviewers. Note Leetcode is mostly web2.0

-- update bpost on workload.
I told my UAT team colleague ...

Sometimes I deliberately slow down and extend my project timeline to some extent, often to do a quality job.
Sometimes I take time off in office, working on personal stuff. (Companies also organize events during work hours.)
Sometimes I spend time learning domain or technology knowledge... which slows down my projects.
Sometimes I chitchat with colleagues from far away, to build support network or provide support.

I don't need to feel guilty.

100 years ago, labourers toiled for 13h x 7d. My wife used to work 7D/w. In the 90s, most Singapore offices operated 5.5 days every week. As of 2022, European workers averaged 35.7 h/week, and max out at 41 in Greece. Using 13x7 as yardstick, we are all lazy bones, and should feel guilty.

What's a fair amount of workload? It depends on our age, our position, the team avarage, our efficiency level, our localsys knowhow,,

Higher quality means better documentation, cleaner code, easier training, more testability, fewer neglected scenarios,,,, Quality invariably requires more time, often less intensity, but reduces failures, down times, and support effort. 

-- update which bpost ... bonus pool?
Tue 17 Dec I received my year-end numbers. Since 2015 I have (and still do) felt that any total comp above 160k is a stressful salary to hold, like holding a heavy deadlift, holding a yoga pose, or holding a hot potato. Though I have no leadership responsibility (architect or lead dev), my pay might be growing closer to that of some small-shop CIOs. Managers' expectation of me is clearly growing, due to my growing tenure in the team, and possibly also due to rising salary. 

The year-end numbers also reveal the importance of a sustainable workload. Current job is less demanding than Baml, Macquarie, etc but slowly becoming unsustainable due to the London manager. I feel my senior manager (who decides my numbers) doesn't want to lose me. 

Still, I told some friends that I can't predict in which year I may be leaving this job, or pressured to quit, or laid off. I have seen these events happening to my coworkers on my floor.

2024: Nothing negative conveyed.
* active in trading issues
* digging deep
* keep up ... "Those details" 
* mentoring .. if possible

Base is steady, still growing. Growing base is not for-granted.

Among the two numbers announced, bonus is more reflective of performance of firm+team+me; base is more important to family /livelihood/. 

Flat bonus ... would still be a huge bonus, allocated to me from the limited bonus pool. I am grateful to the decision maker.
Flat base ... would still be a very high salary, and numerically more significant than the bonus. This salary level feels unsustainable even if flat.

-- fuxi or new: work stress evolution events: MLP
J4: acccurate recollection of work stress, esp. related to boss-relationship

in 2021, when Umesh took over as team lead, there was a bit of adjustment (probably on both sides). By the 2021 year-end meet-up, we had a good rapport. In early 2022, he drove my very first "OKR project" about BloombergEMSx. He soon left, in early 2022. 

2022 H2 was marked by Quark. New Asia team lead (after takeover in mid-2022) was supportive. He didn't have enought hands-on expertise to drive Quark project.

2023 Aug onwards was marked by Genepai. I had some challenging targets to deliver, against inflated expectations. ( In Dec 2023 I was asked to visit NY. ) 2023 Year-end chat with Varun was uncertain but turned out non-threatening.

My son's 2023 WA3 also started a stressful and busy period for the family [counselling, Sec3 repeat,,,].

2024 was a busy year for everyone, from the very beginning. Asia boss started driving multiple concurrent projects on each subordinate.

Apr 2024 CAD diagnosis. Late May I decided to be assertive about workload, but hit firm resistance from boss.

-- fuxi or new: y I have never feared没工作since graduation
Background: in 2023-2025, there were lots of news and social-media analysis of graduate unemployment, most visibly in China. It prompted the question 

Q1: Why after graduating have you never become jobless?
AA: I had a CSM scholarship.
A: I then caught the dotcom wave --
During the final 12M in CSM, I self-taught perl, LAMP to become an in-demand web-dev.
A1: I am a laser .. focused on CV and JIV since my 2000 job search.

Q3: Did you never hit "no-experience, unwelcome"?

When I tried pre-sales, I had zero experience and a lucky break at SCS-SI. Unlike those China graduates, I was hopeful, promising, enthusiastic, confident to both interviewers. (I did help SCS win two projects.)

When I tried SysAdmin (Sperion/Agilent), I had no professional experience but to the interviewers I was technically and personally competent.

When I tried WSt in 2007, I had no "solid" java experience. I self-studied for months before I started "killing" at UBS/GS.

A3: In conclusion, I simply stood out among the crowd in each case.

Q5: Did you ever fail at a job and face the jobless prospect?

I failed many jobs [SCS, EMPWorld, Strategem, OceanLake, Verizon, q3sg, ,,] but recovered quickly. How about my cohort (including the China graduates, comparing to the Victan before 2000)? Majority of them also hit failures (unless they join gov). How many of them recover repeatedly and efficiently like me?

A: In conclusion, I have self-renewal (SP500) capacity.

Q5b: How about your PIP traumas? How do they compare to a China graduate's /adversities/ ?
%%A: PIP experiences were possibly the worst traumas in my life, but they didn't seriously jeopardize my (family) livelihood. I'm a laser (A1), I stand out from the crowd (A3), I was able to get my job done in every company [SCS ..see above],,

Q7: Did you experience no downturn/drought like "China23-24"?
AA: 1998, 2003 SARS, 2008 GFC

-- fuxi: early to office?
CTO knows (lucky me) I'm in 6-7 days a week, and my personal attendance record could be "right at the top".

CTO has no specific "latest" like 10am. Verbally, he said 10am is a reasonable reference. He recognizes our night meetings. I said 9, 10, 11am and he had no issues.

Trust is key. Trust from senior management in the Sgp team.

Sgp team's privileges may be taken away if our attendance record becomes unacceptable/subpar/. Also, the three rows outside his office can become completely empty in some mornings.

CTO felt that most people are sensible but a few bad apples might take advantage of their manager's physical abssence.

I don't want to lose my personal reputation or CTO's personal trust. I don't want to get on some radar. It's generally safe to spend some office hours on personal projects.

I can come in early on some days to "improve" my average. Before 8.30 would be good for train commute. I can be more confident in discussions.

-- fuxi: reality of temp jobs
I tend to perceive temp jobs positively, as learning.

many unlucky job seekers end up working on temp jobs. No job security, low pay, limited trec
eg: Chinese immigrants to Canada
eg: Shuo in 1997 after graduation
eg: my temp jobs in 2005
eg: many of the jobless 2023 graduates from China universities

If you don't worry about livelihood, then you can enroll in a training program instead.

I feel overworked and not appreciated enough

Need to reduce actual work hours, while I maintain or even increase my quiet hours in office.

尽职尽责 .. tell boss I need to leave earlier and need more time for my projects

-- new or update bpost on opaque^transparency.. which bpost?
After you gain insight into an otherwise opaque system, then your job security and career security improves to some extent, depending on 

* How indispensible/crucial/central/redundant is that opaque system?
* Across industries, how widely used is that opaque system? Murex? Spring? Aeron? Majority of opaque systems are localSys
* rarity of your insight .. Are you a one-man show? VolFitter requires more math:)
* depth of your insight. 
* longevity of the opaque system and its accu and churn-resistance
* crying baby .. PMA takes up work hours and can let me demonstrate my knowledge and book my hours :) In contrast, Nautilus is not a crying baby :(

c++ is deeper and more opaque than java. Shell/perl/python are usually less opaque but python can become opaque as described in another bpost.

How about PMA? Not so opaque; indispensible; one-man show

-- fuxi: I used to enjoy/exploit my perl/SQL/unix GTD "superpower"
I often find a secret killer skill in perl and shell as a power drill when facing a stone wall in project. 

advanced git is popular
shell scripting remains evergreen.
git-bash is useful for me, but not used by others
Nowadays advanced SQL is relevant only in places like PWM. Perl is only used for one-liners.
remote debugg .. Un-usalbe 50% the time when I need it. Live debugger is not as reliable as static command line tools.
One good use of remote debugging is .. revealing at least one way a method is used.
