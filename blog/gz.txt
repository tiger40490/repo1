-- new: 尽职尽责 grandpa's wisdom
If you do your part yet struggle to meet some arbitrary expectation of the manager and feeling burned out or overstretched, then you have two choice --

You can bend over backward, learn to accept the higher expectation, higher workload as Jenny of MS described,,, slow boiling
You can put in a reasonable effort, 尽职尽责, resist the pressure to take on more

Judgement -- what's reasonable workload, and what's too much.
Sonic Jason's view -- no better job out there, so better accept.

-- new or update bpost on opaque^transparency.. which bpost?
After you gain insight into an otherwise opaque system, then your job security and career security improves to some extent, depending on 

* How indispensible is that opaque system?
* Across industries, how widely used is that opaque system? Murex? Spring? Aeron? Majority of opaque systems are localSys
* rarity of your insight .. Are you a one-man show? VolFitter:)
* depth of your insight. VolFitter:)
* longevity of the opaque system and its accu and churn-resistance

c++ is deeper and more opaque than java. Shell/perl/python are usually less opaque but python can become opaque as described in another bpost.

portable t-investment .. zero for localSys 
engaging .. high-churn could be more exciting
market value .. zero for localSys

-- fuxi: I used to enjoy/exploit my perl/SQL/unix GTD "superpower"
I often find a secret killer skill in perl and shell as a power drill when facing a stone wall in project. 

advanced git is popular
shell scripting remains evergreen.
git-bash is useful for me, but not used by others
Nowadays advanced SQL is relevant only in places like PWM. Perl is only used for one-liners.
remote debugg .. Un-usalbe 50% the time when I need it. Live debugger is not as reliable as static command line tools.
One good use of remote debugging is .. revealing at least one way a method is used.
