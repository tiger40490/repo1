-- web2.0 is a good phrase for a vague and broad category. Remarkably, It has not received any criticism


--new: tech IV: communication appraisal 
In the U.S. competitive landscape, communication skill often means English speaking, listening and esp. explaning complex technical issues. This is due to the talent pool dominated by immigrants from East Europe and Asia.

On the job, communication skills often include email writing. At a higher level, it also includes empathy/rapport, persuasion and relationship-building.

Some interviews, exp. the leadership interviews do try to assess the relationship skills, but it's highly inaccurate and highly subjective.

Some new hires show very different ratings on these two fronts. my interview with the Japanese NumTech failed partly due to lack of humor.

--fuxi chat with Sachin
Am process oriented?
Asked too many questions?
I now have a reputation for being detailed and reliable. A reputation hard to protect. It can backfire on me

--informal feedbacks during year-end party
"You are process oriented, which is missing in the local team. We are not used to so many questions so we ignored some of your questions. We assume each team member has maturity and needs only a pointer and can figure out the rest." In zed I used to feel the same about asking questions, but in GS it all changed. 

* Kevin -- "needs some guidance"
* Gary -- needs to speak out. Not taking initiative to show leadership.
* Anurag -- very sharp guy, but i think he is fast at the expense of quality. Nevertheless, he is probably very sharp.

It's really dangerous to openly talk about other team members in front of other people whom we may not know so well.
These 2 guys are sophisticated but I think their habit is quite reckless. 
However, if we don't take this opportunity now, then we may not know how we think of each other.

I was rather bold when talking about Anurag in public. I think that might be the first unsafe comment of the night.

--fuxi: smart guys like Kun.h couldn't crack the quant IV cos
* too selective, comparable to HFT
* poor market depth. I guess Kun ended in a risk quant role.

Henry Luo, Sunil, Anil .. with limited experience can become highly-paid or senior java developers. This is testament to low entry barrier, market depth of java job market.

Some managers are just good at managing a lot of projects, but they may have some limitations elsewhere

-- if I benchmark myself on piano, fitness, BMI, even math ... i will see my biggest strenghs in dev IV.
Luckily, this domain has superior market depth

In school, my biggest strength is theoretical physics, but now I believe math and computing has higher market value.

--new: if I had not entered finDev
Some (casual) observers may say that without the 2007 WalSt journey I would have gone to web2.0 shops. 
Well, majority of non-finDev guys in my age group have not gone there. 
Look at all of my ex-colleagues. 
Those who go into some web2.0 shops in SG are not earning 200k. Also, they must manage teams, in which I'm uninterested/unsuitable.

What's the likelihood that I get into SG finDev without the U.S. trip? Questionable, because of entry barrier not only in IV. I would need to try 10-30 interviews but SG market doesn't let me keep trying

Perhaps my disposition translates to strength in the web2.0 space? 
Well, financial dnlg(math++), multi-threading, language-details, latency knowledge are my strong games that are non-critical to web2.0 interviews.
