-- update which bpost on bonus
tip: Be sincere
reminder: Be humble. 乌鸦叼肥肉 .. Discussing? demonstrate appreciation, not overjoyed. Others may have bigger bonuses but don't show overjoy.
tip: be grateful to the decision makers, presumably local and NY mgr, and CEO. 
The numbers this (and previous) year(s) are by no means arbitrary, trivial. They represent a conscious decision. Team bonus pool is a fixed amount. Increasing my bonus requires decreasing a coworker's bonus.
show appreciation by ... decent effort

tip: no need to overwork or bend over backward

reminder: manage the weight of expectation. No need to pay a counsellor, but blogg may help

reminder (from Grandma): at my age and in this (ageist) industry, most greying finDevs have various difficulties.
My current performance level is decent, respectable, no mean achievement.
My wife and in-laws should be proud of me.

reminder: impermanence .. the generous numbers are not an iron rice bowl, and are conditional on firm/individual performance, and up to the individual decision maker.

Q: how is my general intelligence? Not in the sense of wisdom or street smart.

I always thought I am good at taking tests, but I have survived in many demanding, high-paying jobs. Crucially, I was able to pass almost a hundred JIVs, which relied on tech test + real-world problem-solving. So the conclusion from JIV and on-the-job performance is /unequivocal/ -- high intelligence at least as a professional.

-- new: fintech: %%definition
Why bother?

My definition will be based on https://bootcamp.cvn.columbia.edu/blog/what-is-fintech/

Early credit cards in the 1950s generally represent the first fintech products available to the public.

In this Columbia blog, the criteria is vague. No acid test. The concept is more alined to consumer finance or mass-market finance.

-- update bpost on workload, but which one?
worker's skill and efficiency is a big unknown factor to a new project manager. 
The longer you stay, the more efficient you become as a worker, but expectation on you also rises, as manager knows your skills better.

-- update or new: how do immigration authorities identify elite talent
For academic talent, research output would be the criterion used by immigration authorities (like an academic employer). However, most elite talents are not academic research.

Criterion: education credentials. "Top 100 unviersity" lend more credibility than just about anything else
Criterion: salary, as decided by an employer with due diligence
