==I pointed out that zbs is vague, compared to QQ and GTD.
Many zbs learning experiences (me or DQH) were arguably irrelevant if never quizzed.

--iv questions on malloc, tmalloc and the facebook malloc
In latency benchmarks, c++ should simply 1) avoid DMA or 2) pre-allocate. Therefore, if the iv question touches on benchmark, then the malloc question become moot.

--iv questions on lockfree in c++
messier and more low-level than lockfree in jvm. I would say lockfree is seldom written by a c++ app developer. Therefore not a GTD topic at all. Purely QQ halo topic.

--iv question on volatile
Again, many interviewers use volative as concurrency feature in c++ but it's non-standard !  Even if it has a side effect if using gcc, the practice is "not something I would recommend", though I won't criticize hiring team's current practice.

--iv question on throwing dtor
c++ standard says UDB but still some interviewers ask about it. So this topic is not zbs not GTD but really QQ

--iv question on debugger breakpoint
Not GTD, not even zbs

--iv question (GS-HK) on CAS no slower than uncontended lock acquisition
I feel I don't need to know how much faster. My knowledge is good enough for GTD

--iv question on how many clock cycles per instruction
no GTD but zbs for a latency enthusiast

--update blogpost on not left behind ... https://1330152open.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=17035&action=edit

I have achieved a lot (cf my peers) in wellness, ffree, branded degree, career longevity,,, but still, to earn the worldly, materialistic OtherPeople'sEnvy (OPE), I need to move up (or start up). 
This has been the stonewall I hit over and over. 
Not my game, and I gave up years ago.

I think it was wise of me to give up.

Over the years I have worked on the give-up, the stonewall, the OPE, and slowly mellowing up.

Note impressive edu credential are an achievement in itself, like a competition title, even if it creates no earning increase.
