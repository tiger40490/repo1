-- new: fintech: %%definition
Why bother?

My definition will be based on https://bootcamp.cvn.columbia.edu/blog/what-is-fintech/

Early credit cards in the 1950s generally represent the first fintech products available to the public.

In this Columbia blog, the criteria is vague. No acid test. The concept is more alined to consumer finance or mass-market finance.

-- update bpost on workload, but which one?
worker's skill and efficiency is a big unknown factor to a new project manager. 
The longer you stay, the more efficient you become as a worker, but expectation on you also rises, as manager knows your skills better.

-- update or new: how do immigration authorities identify elite talent
For academic talent, research output would be the criterion used by immigration authorities (like an academic employer). However, most elite talents are not academic research.

Criterion: education credentials. "Top 100 unviersity" lend more credibility than just about anything else
Criterion: salary, as decided by an employer with due diligence
