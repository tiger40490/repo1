-- new employee benefits: addicted
Since I graduated and started work for local or small employers, I have witnessed and enjoyed increasingly luxurious staff benefits. I often feel pampered.  I often feel pressured to "deliver" and "perform", to deserve these benefits.  As soon as you leave the firm (for whatever reasons) these luxuries disappear (as next employer may not offer the same).

[[work a little less, live a little more]] described corporate high-fliers addicted to "busy-ness" [overworked, reliable and indispensible]. I guess these high-fliers are (addicted) reliant on many staff benefits to support their busy-ness 

medical leave without MC requirement
medical services (cashless) from any clinic "close to wherever you are"
24H access to nice office (my harbor, my addiction)
flexible hours (my addiction)
remote connectivity from home + vacation

After 2+ years on a job, I tend to make relationship mistakes and rub someone the wrong way, be it my boss, anoter team's boss, or some close colleague.

-- slow-cooking new: Qz (^EPA) episode: inferiority-complex
t_selfEval
I had a deep-rooted inferiority complex across the q3SG perm jobs.
Therefore, before I started on EPA job, I braced myself for the same, and I was actively planning a return to U.S. within 2Y.

Q: How has my inferiority evolved? Note this self-eval question requires lots of Sys2 resources. Many individuals won't bother digging into the various factors (of inferiority) even though inferiority seriously affects our wellbeing.

Factor: appr by manager, in terms of comp numbers, relative importance in the team, and other things. This appr drives that inferiority complex.

Factor: localSys... is now slightly less important in the grand scheme of things. In StirtTech team, I was inferior in terms of localSys (which should have been accepted by mgr + the team). I couldn't follow a lot of the conversations. Mvea and EPA team... pretty much the same. 
(Aha) my EPA compensation is convincing evidence of manager's acceptance of my localSys.
Also, Sachin's localSys didn't earn much appr.

Factor: VP peer benchmark ... esp. in terms of localSys and value-add. Benchmark breeds inferiority. I have never wanted to be benchmarked with VPs. At RTS and Mvea, I was never benchmarked with VPs. In EPA, I try not to care or observe. I tell myself that we are all (informally) evaluated, all the time, by everyone but I'm older and less capable. I do that to fend off the inferiority.
