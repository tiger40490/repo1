Q: why does QQ study feel more serious, more like work than wellness research, when the latter is more strategic more important to my wellbeing?
coding is my profession. By growing as a coder, I become more in-demand in the economy. Then I increase earning capacity to support various family needs.

--"Those" peers are not smarter, more successful than me
Many are still consultants. Actually consultant career have its advantages and charms.

Many are stuck at VP level and facing job insecurity.

Most of them lack the mgmt skill to move into senior leadership. Those who do, tend to be in China or HK. 
If you are not the right personality, then the leadership career path is more painful, less in-control, more 被动, less confident, more prone to failure.

--new but no hurry: analyzing my perception of reality
othRisk
Using words and numbers, am trying to "capture" my perceptions (intuitions, observations and hopefully a bit of insights) of the c++/java job market trends, past and future. There's some reality out there but each person including the expert observer has only a limited view of that reality, based on limited data.

Those numbers look impressive, but actually similar to the words -- they are mostly personal perceptions dressed up as objective measurements.

If you don't use words or numbers then you can't capture any observation of the "reality". Your impression of that reality (without words you can't even refer to that reality) remains hopelessly vague. I now believe vague is the lowest level of comprehension, usually as bad as a biased comprehension. Using words + numbers we have a chance to improve our perception.

my perceptions shape my decisions, and my decisions affect my family's life chances.

my perceptions shape my selective listening. Gradually, actively, my selective listening would modify my "membrane"! All great thinkers, writers update their membrane.

Am not analyzing reality. Instead, 
Am basically analyzing my perception of the reality, but that's the best I could do. I'm good at analyzing myself as an object.

Refusing to plan because of high uncertainty is lazy, is pessimistic, is doomed.

Within a month, You can often (not always) predict a worker's long-term attitude?
On this job I feel I would continue for a few months to show commitment (to deadlines), dedication (not so much distraction), sense of urgency ..

How about mvea job? I think I became distracted and spent too many work hours on non-work like nutrition, housing, QQ, 
 
Q: why I feel more dedicated (and motivated) on this job compared to earlier jobs?

* colleagues are less dedicated, but same at OC

After listening to FPGA, off-heap memory latency ...
I feel the arms race of latency is limited to high-speed trading only.

latency technology has limited economic value compared to mobile, cloud, cryptocurrency, or even data science and machine learning.

--update blogpost: every time I try the SG job market, recruiters would tell me there are so many "new" employers or new markets, but invariably, i need to focus on the old guards .. mostly ibanks, as the new market is not open to me.

This is similar to Deepak, Shanyou trying the wall St c++ job market.

(I used to update the blog directly, searching for multiple suitable blogposts... time consuming)
