After hibernation, first few years in the U.S. quite possibly my stress level (and wife's) would grow.

Would a contract job  offer stress relief, or a VP job? Clearly, contract job feels lighter, despite the lower salary and lower job security.

--new: max-hib chocies: PIP^FOLB
If I lose current job, I see 3 choices. 

Default choie (short hibernation) -- go to U.S. right away. 
Plan 1 -- Give myself 2M to find a SG job around 150k and face the PIP risk
Plan 2 -- Give myself 1M to find a SG job around 60k quickly, to reduce PIP risk. Perhaps a junior or contract job.  Main downside is FOLB.

--fuxi:
my daily sense of "good work" depends mostly on 
AA) visible output
BB) my own sacrifice, sometimes invisible. Factors inlucde the amount of hours I spend in office

Without BB, sometimes I feel a bit guilty, but usually I feel proud of myself.

--new or update blogpost on bonus?
Bonus is only one person’s appraisal of my value-add, attitude, ...
Therefore, my own self-assessment and self-esteem can reference that but only as a small factor. It’s very dangerous to tie my self-esteem to this single factor. People can and do care too much about this one factor.

Bonus amount is heavily influenced by the base salary. Low bonus could still mean a high total comp compared to teammates.

In many places (Macq, GS,,, ) I actually cared to do a good job for the boss and for the firm, but still failed to impress the boss. In such a context, I must contain the damage of that appraisal, or risk ruining my self-esteem and motivation at work.
