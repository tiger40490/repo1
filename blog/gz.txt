--Siddesh:
similar to TYY, these individuals are good at climbing up
When one of them eventualy moves up, I feel the pain of FOLB
This is one of the 2 commonest pains in my blogpost, but becoming less painful less devastating as I age
(As I age the self-mgmt advantages has started to emerge -- wellness, cashfow, career longevity,,,)

But their brank or higher (temporary) income is not necessary in my life,,,

--Q: Am I driven to master the localSys? I think a bit of negative motivation (fear) is needed. 

I think I wasn't at mvea. At RTS I lost the steam after a while. 

What's my vague definition of mastering? Perhaps I did master the pspc module?

[1] I would say yes at catcha, empworld, zed, Strategem, RTS. Perhaps yes at Chartered, 

--oth: system architect career path that Qihao described 
I'm biased against such a career path. I think some interviewers expect the contractor to bring valuable experience to the table and propose solutions (to be decided by the app owner)

Q: was I able to play that role? 
A: I think Josh actually felt I was able to. I think that was at a micro level, but I might be able to at higher level as well.

A: I think Venkat and Shubin actually noticed it 

I think Yang, Chad... were more successful doing this, though I didn't like Yang's java solutions. 

I probably have a blogpost on my past record. Overall, I think this "promise" is not easy to deliver. My track record was mixed.

In recent jobs, I have not been very keen, determined to overcome the challenges and propose new ideas. To score a point, I don't really need to get it implemented. 

I feel at Mvea I lost the initial drive.

At my age, I don't need to be a strong coder
I only need to maintain my IV form -- both QQ and CIV

--Update blogpost on boxer in a corner
however strong you are in a dev team, there are tasks to "reveal" your relative weaknesses, unless your team is mediocre and you are stronger than average on all fronts [1]. 
--update blogposts with t_expert blog tag
Ashish said his GTD skill is .. but someone like him would appear an amater to the real experts.
--fuxi: the hottest c++ job domain is HFT, but
.. but they underpay web2.0 and they only pay slightly more than ibanks
.. but the skillset is not portable or upstream to java ! I think it's rather niche
I think the c++ latency QQ knowledge is 99% bookish, not GTD skills at all.
