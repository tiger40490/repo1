-- update bpost on Anurag ^ miles ...
Compare Anurag vs Mos .. Even if you are old and slower, the company would keep you, but you should NOT rise to manager level like Kevin D or George P

Every challenge in Genepai is my problem, but the 2 of them are supposed to help out, so it's fine to delegate to them, while I design high-level things and take on modules that are hard to delegate.

If one of them become better than me and more productive than me, that can be a good thing. Manager should not penalize me.

If they become independent and can contribute productively, I think managers would be delighted.

I need a balanced, fair, positive attitude on young developers.

-- fuxi or update which bpost?
[23]bonus: reminder
tip: Be sincere
tip: be grateful to the decision makers, presumably local and NY mgr, and CEO. 
The numbers this (and previous) year(s) are by no means arbitrary, trivial. They represent a conscious decision. Team bonus pool is a fixed amount. Increasing my bonus requires decreasing a coworker's bonus.
show appreciation by ... decent effort

tip: no need to overwork or bend over backward

reminder: manage the weight of expectation. No need to pay a counsellor, but blogg may help

reminder (from Grandma): at my age and in this (ageist) industry, most greying finDevs have various difficulties.
My current performance level is decent, respectable, no mean achievement.
My wife and in-laws should be proud of me.

reminder: impermanence .. the generous numbers are not an iron rice bowl, and are conditional on firm/individual performance, and up to the individual decision maker.
