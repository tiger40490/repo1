I wanted a semi-retirement job with reasonable salary, but low calibre, low workload, low pace. (SXA said Oracle has some deparments (or job functions) like that but these jobs are unstable.)

I said my experience at Citi gave me that impression. SXA said he has interactions with some backend Citi departments such as but not only the online banking backend:
* mission critical
* many approvals and controls.. lengthy process.. therefore slow pace
* low or no green-field element. Mostly maintenance.
* complex legacy system
* Some young bachelor guys can spend many hours every day with the system

For all my career esp. after 35, my competitive strengths in theoretical + details are evergreen and vital advantages in tech IV.

Performance (including bigO, but excluding field turning) is all about details.

In contrast, speed coding is less of "my game". It is like a sprint race for a footballer.
