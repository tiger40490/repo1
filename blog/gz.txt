I heard a departing colleague's truthful reflections including the reasons for the departure. One of the reasons is related to comp benchmark. I guess (with good level of confidence) that he feels that given his value-add and effort, he should receive $XX more (whatever XX is).

The more one dwells on it, the more one would feel unfair -- Someone else in the same team has the same level of value-add but was rewarded much more.

It's a valuable protection that I don't put in extra effort and sacrifice for the manager. It protects me from the hazard of harmful comparision. 

At my age, I don't salary-benchmark as much as in my 30s -- I don't care so much about wasting my potential, my spare capacity. It's good and bad. 

It's bad if I am chronically underpaid (20% below market) like J.Zhang.
It's good if my employer and my manager is generous and keen to retain older devs like me.

Shi.Cheng hinted that interview prep is not his long-term mission. I think he wants to build zbs and grow on the tech ladder or the mgr ladder. German also said "it's hard to hire a decent tech lead or app owner".

I felt slightly ashamed. However, now I'm kinda mellowing up. Lead role comes with higher responsibility, higher stress, higher risk. Look at YW.Chen among others. The financial reward is not worth much. 

The risks to old-timer is easily underestimated. Their job security is tenuous.
Sometimes we get into a new job and find a nasty manager (Yang to Roland), or long hours (PWM), or hard, uninspiring technology stack (Qz).

Some 10% just quit decisively within 6M, like Henry Fu. This route requires the key skill of IV.

The rest of us try to get used to the new job. Sometimes this proves to be patient, steady and effective.

Some 10%+ suffer in pain, like Sudhir (based on my limited knowledge) and my OC job.
