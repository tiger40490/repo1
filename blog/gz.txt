I want to remain relevant to the digital economy.
I want to stay as SWE. My FullerWealth is growing by the month, despite inflation. Still that is not enough to /relieve/ aging-related work pressure.
I think I need to look to older colleagues including WStC to find the relief. 

Compare Anurag vs Mos .. Even if you are old and somewhat slower, the company would keep you, but you may NOT want to rise to manager level like Kev.Doherty or G.Petras

-- fuxi or update ...: 
when I feel stressed about Genepai progress, I can feel relieved that the two full-time young devs didn't find a better solution than mine.

Apparently, there's no yardstick to guage progress.
However, Genepai made enough progress (albeit small) to /earn/ multiple business trips between Sgp and NYC.

The deliverable is a dream. If you show effort and make *some* progress, then they would probably reward you for trying.

Other AI projects in EqTech rarely have any full-time devs. 

Assessor won't look at how much code I wrote/rewrote. Too hard to assess the quantity or quality. Any refactor/clean-up/bugfix is invisible on the surface but take lots of time.

Every challenge in Genepai is my problem, but the 2 of them are supposed to help out, so it's fine to delegate to them, while I design high-level things and take on modules that are hard to delegate.

If one of them becomes better than me and more productive than me, that can be a good thing. Manager should not penalize me.

If they become independent and can contribute productively, I think managers would be delighted.
