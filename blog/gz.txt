Meaningful value-add of an employee's job does matter, esp. when that value-add is in question. Some 10% of all workers in a country might question their company's value-add.
* sitting on bench like Infosys "trainees"
* scam call center employees
* gambling/betting business employees
* MLM or other promoters of dubious products
* sales/maketing employees of second-class product vendors

doctors, programmers, ... are among the few professions with excellent depth@mkt.
Once you are qualified, there are many "ordinary" jobs that pay much higher than the local median wage.

Doctors enjoy career longevity; programmers enjoy international mobility.

NBA, artists, film professionals .. lack d@m

look at the SG film festival brochure. Those film makers don't make nearly as much money as the blockbusters. They are small-budget or indie films. It's like an expensive modern art form, supported by advertizers, corporate sponsors and governments. 

I guess like NBA, 5% of the players make 95% of the money.
Perhaps game development is somewhat similar, based on brief chats with Dahlan. I feel the best career prospect for an ordinary game developer is pivot to c++ findev.

What if my kids get into that domain? 
-- career longevity: finDev
sales career.. quite tiring when you are older and less energetic
trading career .. young energy needed
mgmt career .. young managers can become a challenger.
SWE career .. possibly shares some of the longevity advantages of research career
finDev .. has domain nlg, but 
* the math dnlg is rarely needed in any job.
* the jargons are easily acquired
* the tech best practices are less portable, less widely applicable

A finance professional could claim that she can earn more in a year than a Grade-1 classmate makes in 10Y, and it's not even an outlier year.

What we don't discuss is, the classmate (accountant, engineer, RnD, nurse..) can grow her career, and more or less maintain a salary for decades, often until retirement.

A trading career is much shorter, according to Kun.H and also a prop trader classmate. Older traders often need to step aside and become risk managers.

Career longevity provides inflation protection + meaningful engagement in old age, so I don't mind slightly lower lifetime income.

Most of my past techBets and tsn ... are likely to pay lower dividends after first 10Y. 
Strategic orgro is a holy grail.
I will receive the dividend when I change job  back to .. bondMath, mkt data, sockets, SQL or Perl, 

We all have to be discretionary, cautious in our positioning.
I spend lots of time blgg about this.
Despite the underwhelming results of my techBets and tsn, we must not give up.
Applicable to Singapore government too. 
We need to decide what tech to take up and what to put off.

For the last 15Y, finDev IV is my chose game.
The 3 types of dnlg are still relevant.

There are many differences and a few similarities.

In terms of design skill, developers peak at mid-30s to 50+. Depending on domain, accumulation and wisdom can help, but not as much as medical, sciences or teaching.

In terms of learning (various sub-domains), I feel developers peak at 20 to 40+. It depends largely on foundation, interest, habit..

In terms of GTD, depending on the system and job role, developers peak at 20 to 50+. It depends on habit, passion, dedication...

In terms of dnlg, I identified 3 types [lingo^math^arch]. These 3 types demand some level of interest, aptitude. Some developers peak at 30+ to 50+.

Shi.Cheng hinted that interview prep is not his long-term mission. I think he wants to build zbs and grow on the tech ladder or the mgr ladder. German also said "it's hard to hire a decent tech lead or app owner".

I felt slightly ashamed. However, now I'm kinda mellowing up. Lead role comes with higher responsibility, higher stress, higher risk. Look at YW.Chen among others. The financial reward is not worth much. 

The risks to old-timer is easily underestimated. Their job security is tenuous.
Sometimes we get into a new job and find a nasty manager (Yang to Roland), or long hours (PWM), or hard, uninspiring technology stack (Qz).

Some 10% just quit decisively within 6M, like Henry Fu. This route requires the key skill of IV.

The rest of us try to get used to the new job. Sometimes this proves to be patient, steady and effective.

Some 10%+ suffer in pain, like Sudhir (based on my limited knowledge) and my OC job.

-- where can I use this term?
tenuous(fragile) job security

NoSql is bigData, not DS/ML. 

Data Science probably favors python or R. ML is even less suitable for java.
ML includes classification, recommendation, ,, NeuralNetwork is part of ML

The last weekend of Oct 2021, I put in many hours 
* to add visualization
* to add more tests

Why? What's the motivation, j4 and ROTI? I asked the same question about MSFM, C#, Swing, quant self-study, python... I still don't have a good analytical framework. 

Key observation -- time won't stand still. It keeps flowing at a constant rate. Time can't be warehoused. If I don't spend my time on this coding practice, I would easily "waste" it on one of the energy sinks.

This coding drill has multiple benefits in hindsight
* the visualization emboldened me to engage Deepak, Daryl, Josh Lim, even my son. The "engagement" further enhances my "learning" .. various aspects
* my visualization is now barely usable for the "engagement", but if it is unusable, then my effort would still be a worthwhile effort. It reminds me of my pre-sales effort, my self-employment days... 
* I had a blogpost about  weekends otherwise wasted: G3 ROI@UChicago. Even if the code doesn't work, this is still zqbx. Without this zqbx, my ezlife feels decadent, wasteful and an incomplete success. 

My friends' effort and my own effort were not in vein. It restored my self-confidence as a c++ developer. The self-confidence is priceless.

Jolt: However, In terms of financial support, government handout is tiny compared to employers' severance package.

The two things are not aligned.Â 

-- fuxi: With 92S27 ex-classmates, I now can call myself a WallSt veteran techie, one of the most upstream sectors 
Evidence for "veteran"? Not GTD, not even zbs, but mostly the interview-visible expertise. 

This expertise is about the only criteria IMO. Anyone "strong" on this front is considered a veteran, regardless of his GTD, localSys....  Anyone weak on this front .. can still be a veteran, but with limited mobility.

A veteran developer doesn't need to be an above-average developer or expert developer but need to possess some demonstrable experience in the field. Therefore, a long stay in one team (Jack.Zhang?) is less valuable than multiple one-year projects.

Can you acquire this expertise with only 3Y experience? You would need to attend many interviews.
