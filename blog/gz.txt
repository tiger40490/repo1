if I lose MLP job and decide to remain in SG, I would face a much smaller finDev job pool with too many competitors. The buy-side jobs would be too demanding, age-unfriendly. The crypto jobs would be age-unfriendly. The ibank jobs would be much fewer than in WSt. I would have poor job choices like Qz and OC job.

-- update blogpost -- DavidWei on Canada:
Chinese immigrants in Canada probably want to work in U.S. just as U.S. tech students want to work in WsC

I heard a departing colleague's truthful reflections including the reasons for the departure. One of the reasons is related to comp benchmark. I guess (with good level of confidence) that he feels that given his value-add and effort, he should receive $XX more (whatever XX is).

The more one dwells on it, the more one would feel unfair -- Someone else in the same team has the same level of value-add but was rewarded much more.

It's a valuable protection that I don't put in extra effort and sacrifice for the manager. It protects me from the hazard of harmful comparision. 

At my age, I don't salary-benchmark as much as in my 30s -- I don't care so much about wasting my potential, my spare capacity. It's good and bad. 

It's bad if I am chronically underpaid (20% below market) like J.Zhang.
It's good if my employer and my manager is generous and keen to retain older devs like me.
