Why as contractor the expectation on me is lower?
 
A common reason is localSys. For first year on any job, I'm not always expected to gain localSys knowledge. As contractor, I often stay for only 1-2 years.

In several contract jobs, I take on green field projects, with limited localSys responsibilities.

The underlying pattern -- localSys is my relative weakness. However, sometimes localSys became my strength, like RTS, Guardian,

CSY described the reaction of his 3 India-born contractors when manager anounced in a meeting the termination of their project. Project funding would end very soon.
Mgr promised to try and find other teams, but it's unlikely to keep all 3 contractors.
CSY felt so much luckier because as perm he would have a job in other projects in the same team.

Therefore, he felt he would consider contract only if salary is 50% higher.

This type of observation/experience reinforces the job insecurity "smell" of the contract career.

-- noblog: looking back at the (stressful) days at Stirt, what are important?
* boss approval ? still important
* bonus amount? LG2
* commute? LG2
* Y-junction neglect due to work stress? LG2
* good sleep? important
* career longevity? important
** dnlg-math? important only for job IV moat over the long term
** in contrast, salary now is secondary
* opportunity to collaborate with US/EU? important
* opportunity to work on weekends? important

The spectacular office building and view, and the jogging path nearby generates stress rather than relief.

-- tanko on manager's neg appraisal
At our age, we have our own inherent worth, and it doens't depend on that one man's assessment.

Another self-help SMS: "accumulate asset" -- AshS

-- fuxi or new: 
as employee, when I have family issues, kids issues, investment foes, I would fear an appraisal. Even a bonus disappointment would add a heavy blow.

As contract, no such fear. When I'm let go, I would easily attribute it to budget and go job hunting again.

-- typical bonus amount:
Tanko said AWS + 1M bonus. Very good if on a high base. I don't want to compare up.

For a base salary 5-10k then this is more commonplace, but still good.

I told Tanko .. the perfect job/mgr is one who accepts me as a greying, low-energy, unambitious techie, who does get things done.

Tanko said some older managers are tolerant. Many team members are probably similar in productivity.

Tanko said he is older/slower than colleagues but more attentative to details.

--new: fast-finisher^slow-finisher
Many of my peers were very efficient. They can focus and get a lot done in a short while. I tend to feel inferior (which is the main problem addressed in this blogpost).

Problem: they tend to waste their time after they finish early.  In contrast, some slow-finishers get to enjoy the process longer and in depth. Think of fine food, love-making, binge-watching multiple movies.

Dining (and intercourse) is a good place for slow-finishers. You enjoy more.

Exam vs self-practice: in MCQ exams, fast-finisher is a huge advantage provided accuracy is not sacrificed. fast-n-accurate. In self-practice, some people learn best in slow motion.

Problem (for students + coding drill): they don’t refresh the learning so they tend to forget more. Since I learn slowly, I tend to have better retention.

Problem: they don’t investigate further so they don’t gain further insights that I gain.

Problem (for developers): Sometimes they don’t pay enough attention to details, or they don’t add enough documentation; or they don’t test thoroughly;

When taking exams, I never hand in early. There no benefit, except to impress/intimidate other exam takers.

Problem: They tend to get bored a bit more. That boredom may or may not turn into creativity (as BBC suggested). As a slow-finisher, I tend to enjoy the process a bit more.

.. Q: what do these guys do After their early finish?
A: ... waste their time

On a similar note, many of my college friends are able to function with 6H of daily sleep (making me feel weaker and inferior) but what do they do with the extra time? Entertainment, Loafing, eating and drinking,,, It's human nature to indulge, when given extra time and money.

--fuxi: wq.l felt gov tech is not a technology laggard. He is attracted by that and the job stability. Work load is not lighter than elsewhere.

Is age a problem? wq.l felt yes because the younger developers have more flexibility in salary requirement. However, I feel the younger dev also has an expectation of rising income. Any signs any evidence that "My career may not be as promising as thought, not growing as fast as my age group" tend to be devastating, even destructive. In other words, the older dev is allowed to be slower, mediocre, more low-energy (as I told Sachin).

--fuxi web2.0 is a good phrase for a vague and broad category. Remarkably, It has not received any criticism

--fuxi chat with Sachin
Am process oriented?
Asked too many questions?
I now have a reputation for being detailed and reliable. A reputation hard to protect. It can backfire on me

--informal feedbacks during year-end party
"You are process oriented, which is missing in the local team. We are not used to so many questions so we ignored some of your questions. We assume each team member has maturity and needs only a pointer and can figure out the rest." In zed I used to feel the same about asking questions, but in GS it all changed. 

* Kevin -- "needs some guidance"
* Gary -- needs to speak out. Not taking initiative to show leadership.
* Anurag -- very sharp guy, but i think he is fast at the expense of quality. Nevertheless, he is probably very sharp.

It's really dangerous to openly talk about other team members in front of other people whom we may not know so well.
These 2 guys are sophisticated but I think their habit is quite reckless. 
However, if we don't take this opportunity now, then we may not know how we think of each other.

I was rather bold when talking about Anurag in public. I think that might be the first unsafe comment of the night.

* too selective, comparable to HFT
* poor market depth. I guess Kun ended in a risk quant role.

Henry Luo, Sunil, Anil .. with limited experience can become highly-paid or senior java developers. This is testament to low entry barrier, market depth of java job market.

Some managers are just good at managing a lot of projects, but they may have some limitations elsewhere

-- if I benchmark myself on piano, fitness, BMI, even math ... i will see my biggest strenghs in dev IV.
Luckily, this domain has superior market depth

In school, my biggest strength is theoretical physics, but now I believe math and computing has higher market value.

--new: if I had not entered finDev
Some (casual) observers may say that without the 2007 WalSt journey I would have gone to web2.0 shops. 
Well, majority of non-finDev guys in my age group have not gone there. 
Look at all of my ex-colleagues. 
Those who go into some web2.0 shops in SG are not earning 200k. Also, they must manage teams, in which I'm uninterested/unsuitable.

What's the likelihood that I get into SG finDev without the U.S. trip? Questionable, because of entry barrier not only in IV. I would need to try 10-30 interviews but SG market doesn't let me keep trying

Perhaps my disposition translates to strength in the web2.0 space? 
Well, financial dnlg(math++), multi-threading, language-details, latency knowledge are my strong games that are non-critical to web2.0 interviews.
