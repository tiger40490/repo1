in a 2022 nightmare, I rejoined Macq and was dismissed again. 
I did my best but again was the weakest in the team.

In hind sight, the job requirement was simply too high.
How about AshS in his CTO job? CSDoctor's job? S.Liu's job? YY.Tao's job?

If I were to benchmark myself with so-called peers, try to increase my brank, and join the exclub, I would get derailed, lose my carefree ezlife, take on lots of stress. 
If I try, could I become an architect? Not my strength.
If I try, could I become a lead developer like Ash.S? Not sure. Ash.S seems to take on too much.

At my age, I have an implicit self-conviction that most of the higher-paying positions are too stressful, with exorbitant expectation.
What I'm unsure is the salary spread. What additional income is possible? After tax, 100k/Y additional? Not worth it.

I told grandpa that my successE [carefree ezlife + harmony, based on wellness and comfortable livelihood] is rare among my cohort, not because I'm better off than them, but because I don't focus on the wrong goals.

The nightmare scenario is much more severe than CB2022

-- update CB2022:
Was the McKinsey boss (Indian) downfall a silly Compliance breach?

Or was he greedy as charged?

QH.Dong mentioned passion and personal interest outside work.
I had some passion and spent lots of personal time on py, sockets, shell scripting, swing,,,

The JIV demands a lot of us!

Street ddance skill can't make money for you.
Singing is similar.
Piano is similar but .... can teach... There's ia good demand.

basketball talent .. Top 0.1% can make money

Speed coding is very different. Many companies are interest in hiring you.

Many guys can GTD like monkey coding. Many medical guys can treat ailments.

The six-figure SWE jobs require a level of expertise like physicians.

if I lose MLP job and decide to remain in SG, I would face a much smaller finDev job pool with too many competitors. The buy-side jobs would be too demanding, age-unfriendly. The crypto jobs would be age-unfriendly. The ibank jobs would be much fewer than in WSt. I would have poor job choices like Qz and OC job.
