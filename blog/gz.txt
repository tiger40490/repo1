--I feel Ashish's MLP IV experience again proves the relative importance of GTD vs QQ

His GTD capacity is evident, but high-end interviews always discount/dismiss GTD and focus on QQ instead, including "problem-solving" as the young bbg interviewer put it.

--fuxi: QQ and coding drill is a full-time job. There are so many details to learn and practice. Some candidates practice for years and become much better than those who practice for months only.

--new: complicent guys]RTS #Deepak
Deepak told me that Rahul, Padma etc stayed in RTS for many years and became "complacent" and uninterested in tech topics outside their work.

I think Deepak has sharp observation.

I notice many Indian colleagues uninterested in zbs or QQ topics. That's a fundamental reason for my QQ strength on the Wall St job market.
I think many of them learn the minimum to pass tech interviews.

If you regularly benchmark yourself externally, often against younger guys, you are probably more aware of your standing, your aging, the pace of tech churn, ... You live your days under more stress, both negative and positive stress. 

I think these RTS guys may benchmark internally once a while, if ever. If the internal peers are not very strong, then you get a false sense of strength.

The RTS team may not have any zbs benchmark, since GTD is 99.9% the focus for the year-end appraisal.

These are some of the reasons Deepak felt 4Y is the max .. Deepak felt H1 guys are always on our toes and therefore more fit for survival.

--new: 
Within a month, You can often (not always) predict a worker's long-term attitude?
On this job I feel I would continue for a few months to show commitment (to deadlines), dedication (not so much distraction), sense of urgency ..

How about mvea job? I think I became distracted and spent too many work hours on non-work like nutrition, housing, QQ, 
 
Q: why I feel more dedicated (and motivated) on this job compared to earlier jobs?

* colleagues are less dedicated, but same at OC
* a small but growing sense of urgency
* I feel I could exceed mgr expectation with 90% effort

--beware of oth
Using words and numbers, am trying to "capture" my perceptions (intuitions, observations and hopefully a bit of insights) of the c++/java job market trends. There's some reality out there but each person including the expert has only a limited view of that reality, based on limited data.

Those numbers look impressive, but actually similar to the words -- they are mostly personal perceptions dressed up as objective measurements.

If you don't use words or numbers then you can't capture any observation of the "reality". Your impression of that reality (without words you can't even refer to that reality) remains hopelessly vague. I now believe vague is the lowest level of comprehension, usually as bad as a biased comprehension. Using words+numbers we have a chance to improve our perception.

my perceptions shape my decisions, and my decisions affect my family's life chances.

my perceptions shape my selective listening. Gradually, actively, my selective listening would modify my "membrane"! All great thinkers, writers update their membrane.

Am basically analyzing my perception of the reality, but that's the best I could do. I'm good at analyzing myself as an object.

Refusing to plan because of high uncertainty is lazy, is pessimistic, is doomed.

--update blogpost: every time I try the SG job market, recruiters would tell me there are so many "new" employers or new markets, but invariably, i need to focus on the old guards .. mostly ibanks, as the new market is not open to me.

This is similar to Deepak, Shanyou trying the wall St c++ job market.

(I used to update the blog directly, searching for multiple suitable blogposts... time consuming)
