I have achieved a lot (cf my peers) in wellness, ffree, branded degree, career longevity,,, but still, to earn the worldly, materialistic OtherPeople'sEnvy (OPE), I need to move up (or start up). 
This has been the stonewall I hit over and over. 
Not my game, and I gave up years ago.

I think it was wise of me to give up.

Over the years I have worked on the give-up, the stonewall, the OPE, and slowly mellowing up.

Note impressive edu credential are an achievement in itself, like a competition title, even if it creates no earning increase.
