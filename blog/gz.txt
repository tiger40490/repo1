For all my career esp. after 35, my competitive strengths in theoretical + details are evergreen and vital advantages in tech IV.

Performance (including bigO, but excluding field turning) is all about details.

In contrast, speed coding is less of "my game". It is like a sprint race for a footballer.

Daily sense@goodWork
my daily sense of "good work" depends mostly on 
AA) visible output, visible to boss and other people
BB) my own sacrifice, sometimes invisible. Factors inlucde the amount of hours I spend in office

AA is dominant.

Without BB, sometimes I feel a bit guilty, but usually I feel proud of myself.
