Sometimes we get into a new job and find a nasty manager (Yang to Roland), or long hours (PWM), or hard, uninspiring technology stack (Qz).

Some 10% just quit decisively within 6M, like Henry Fu. This route requires the key skill of IV.

The rest of us try to get used to the new job. Sometimes this proves to be patient, steady and effective.

Some 10%+ suffer in pain, like Sudhir (based on my limited knowledge) and my OC job.

Shi.Cheng hinted that interview prep is not his long-term mission. I think he wants to build zbs and grow on the tech ladder or the mgr ladder. German also said "it's hard to find a tech lead or app owner".

I felt slightly ashamed. However, now I'm kinda mellowing up. Lead role comes with higher responsibility, higher stress, higher risk. Look at YW.Chen among others. The financial reward is not worth much. 

The risks to old-timer is easily underestimated. Their job security is tenuous.

NoSql is bigData, not DS/ML. 

Data Science probably favors python or R. ML is even less suitable for java.
ML includes classification, recommendation, ,, NeuralNetwork is part of ML

However, In terms of financial support, government handout is tiny compared to employers'.

if an employer permits some reasonable amount of blogging in office, then I'm willing to accept $1k less salary.

Evidence for "veteran"? Not GTD, not even zbs, but mostly the interview-visible expertise. 

This expertise is about the only criteria IMO. Anyone "strong" on this front is considered a veteran, regardless of his GTD, localSys....  Anyone weak on this front .. can still be a veteran, but with limited mobility.

A veteran developer doesn't need to be an above-average developer or expert developer but need to possess some demonstrable experience in the field. Therefore, a long stay in one team (Jack.Zhang?) is less valuable than multiple one-year projects.

Can you acquire this expertise with only 3Y experience? You would need to attend many interviews.

--fuxi web2.0 is a good phrase for a vague and broad category. Remarkably, It has not received any criticism and has stood the test of time

-- fuxi: java is better...
After java5, the core lang is now more stable than c++ in terms of IV topics

Even though jxee job market is volatile, the coreJava niche job market enjoys robust demand.

My strength in low-level details is far more valuable in java than py, perl, SQL etc.

compared to c++, cdd/job ratio is not very different, but the java cdd pool is low-quality. In coreJava, I can easily stand out.

--fuxi informal feedbacks during year-end party
"You are process oriented, which is missing in the local team. We are not used to so many questions so we ignored some of your questions. We assume each team member has maturity and needs only a pointer and can figure out the rest." In zed I used to feel the same about asking questions, but in GS it all changed. 

* Kevin -- "needs some guidance"
* Gary -- needs to speak out. Not taking initiative to show leadership.
* Anurag -- very sharp guy, but i think he is fast at the expense of quality. Nevertheless, he is probably very sharp.

It's really dangerous to openly talk about other team members in front of other people whom we may not know so well.
These 2 guys are sophisticated but I think their habit is quite reckless. 
However, if we don't take this opportunity now, then we may not know how we think of each other.

I was rather bold when talking about Anurag in public. I think that might be the first unsafe comment of the night.
