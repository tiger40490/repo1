Why web2.0 seldom ask this? Not much algo involved. 

Why WallSt often ask this? Reveals efficiency in implementation

--new: scalability^latency
web2.0 shops don't care about latency engineering including multi-threading, language/compiler features

WallSt doesn't care about scalability per se. For them, scalability is achieved with hardware and architecture.

Both camps care about data structures as they are fundamental to scalability and latency.

OPRA feed handler requires scalability. Similarly, my NYSE XDP feed handlers can cope with 370 KMPS per thread. Somehow web2.0 shops are not impressed.
