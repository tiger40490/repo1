--informal feedbacks during year-end party
"You are process oriented, which is missing in the local team. We are not used to so many questions so we ignored some of your questions. We assume each team member has maturity and needs only a pointer and can figure out the rest."

* Sachine -- "overambitious". Took on more work than given to him, but sometimes misses his own work (eg Junit) ... took it the negative way.
* Kevin -- "needs some guidance"
* Gary -- needs to speak out. Not taking initiative to show leadership.
* Anurag -- very sharp guy, but i think he is fast at the expense of quality. Nevertheless, he is probably very sharp.

IT PMET ... hard to receive PR approval. In contrast, lower skill levels are more welcome, becasue few locals are interested in those professions.

Henry Luo, Sunil, Anil .. with limited experience can become highly-paid or senior java developers. This is testament to low entry barrier, market depth of java job market.

--new: tech IV: communication appraisal 
In the U.S. competitive landscape, communication skill often means English skills, given the talent pool dominated by immigrants from East Europe and Asia.

However, my interview with the Japanese NumTech failed partly due to lack of humor.

Some managers are just good at managing a lot of projects, but they may have some limitations elsewhere

-- if I benchmark myself on piano, fitness, BMI, even math ... i will see my biggest strenghs in dev IV.
Luckily, this domain has superior market depth

In school, my biggest strength is theoretical physics, but now I believe math and computing has higher market value.

--new: if I had not entered finDev
Some (casual) observers may say that without the 2007 WalSt journey I would have gone to web2.0 shops. 
Well, majority of non-finDev guys in my age group have not gone there. 
Look at all of my ex-colleagues. 
Those who go into some web2.0 shops in SG are not earning 200k. Also, they must manage teams, in which I'm uninterested/unsuitable.

What's the likelihood that I get into SG finDev without the U.S. trip? Questionable, because of entry barrier not only in IV. I would need to try 10-30 interviews but SG market doesn't let me keep trying

Perhaps my disposition translates to strength in the web2.0 space? 
Well, financial dnlg(math++), multi-threading, language-details, latency knowledge are my strong games that are non-critical to web2.0 interviews.
