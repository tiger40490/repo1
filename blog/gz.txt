--oth: system architect career path that Qihao described 
I'm biased against such a career path. I think some interviewers expect the contractor to bring valuable experience to the table and propose solutions (to be decided by the app owner)

Q: was I able to play that role? 
A: I think Josh actually felt I was able to.
A: I think Venkat and Shubin actually noticed it 

I think Yang, Chad... were more successful doing this, though I didn't like Yang's java solutions. 

I probably have a blogpost on my past record. Overall, I think this "promise" is not easy to deliver. My track record was mixed.

In recent jobs, I have not been very keen, determined to overcome the challenges and propose new ideas. To score a point, I don't really need to get it implemented. 

I feel at Mvea I lost the initial drive.

.. but they underpay web2.0 and they only pay slightly more than ibanks
.. but the skillset is not portable or upstream to java ! I think it's rather niche

I think the c++ latency QQ knowledge is 99% bookish, not GTD skills at all.
