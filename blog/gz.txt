my daily sense of "good work" depends mostly on 
AA) visible output
BB) my own sacrifice, sometimes invisible. Factors inlucde the amount of hours I spend in office

Without BB, sometimes I feel a bit guilty, but usually I feel proud of myself.

Bonus is only one person’s appraisal of … My own self-assessment and self-esteem can reference that but only as a small factor. It’s very dangerous to tie my self-esteem to that single factor. You can care too much about that one factor.

Bonus amount is heavily influenced by the base salary. Low bonus could still mean a high total comp compared to teammates.

In many places (Macq, GS,,, ) I actually cared to do a good job for the boss and for the firm, but still failed to impress the boss. In such a context, I must contain the damage of that appraisal, or risk ruining my self-esteem and motivation at work.

I think a dose (not fixation) of negative motivation (fear) is needed. 

I think I wasn't at mvea. At RTS I lost the steam after a while. 

What's my vague definition of mastering? Perhaps I did master the pspc module?

[1] I would say yes at catcha, empworld, zed, Strategem, RTS. Perhaps yes at Chartered, 

--new: slow track
My Macq managers Kevin A and Stephen Keith are fairly successful long-timers. Such an individual would hold a jog for 5-10 years, grow in know-how, effectiveness (influence,,,). Once a few years they move up the rank. In their eyes, a job hopper or contractor like me is hoplessly left on the slow track -- rollling stone gathers no moss.

I would indeed feel that way if I had not gained the advantages of burn rate + passive incomes. No less instrumental are my hidden advantages like
* frugal wife
* SG citizenship
* stable property in HDB

A common mistake is missing the silent majority of old timres who don't climb up.
