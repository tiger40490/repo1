--jolt: imagine being Saurab or Sanjay. How did they cope with the PIP and "layoff"?
There's a lot I can learn from them.

Sanjay probably experiences multiple layoffs, but does he prefer the package or a contract job? I believe package+PIP is better for him.

--Q: Am I driven to master the localSys? I think a bit of negative motivation (fear) is needed. 

I think I wasn't at mvea. At RTS I lost the steam after a while. 

What's my vague definition of mastering? Perhaps I did master the pspc module?

[1] I would say yes at catcha, empworld, zed, Strategem, RTS. Perhaps yes at Chartered,
