t_selfEval
I had a deep-rooted inferiority complex across the q3SG perm jobs.
Therefore, before I started on epa job, I braced myself for the same, and I was actively planning a return to U.S. within 2Y.

Q: How has my inferiority evolved? Note this self-eval question requires lots of Sys2 resources. Many individuals won't bother digging into the various factors (of inferiority) even though inferiority seriously affects our wellbeing.

Factor: appr by manager, in terms of comp numbers, relative importance in the team, and other things. This appr drives that inferiority complex.

Factor: localSys... is now slightly less important in the grand scheme of things. In StirtTech team, I was inferior in terms of localSys (which should have been accepted by mgr + the team). I couldn't follow a lot of the conversations. Mvea and EPA team... pretty much the same. 
(Aha) my EPA compensation is convincing evidence of manager's acceptance of my localSys.
Also, Sachin's localSys didn't earn much appr.

Factor: VP peer benchmark ... esp. in terms of localSys and value-add. Benchmark breeds inferiority. I have never wanted to be benchmarked with VPs. At RTS and Mvea, I was never benchmarked with VPs. In EPA, I try not to care or observe. I tell myself that we are all (informally) evaluated, all the time, by everyone but I'm older and less capable. I do that to fend off the inferiority.

-- LG2 update bpost on feel`satisfied more than peers
in a 2022 nightmare, I rejoined Macq and was dismissed again. 
I did my best but again was shown to be the weakest in the team, although another set of requirements may prove otherwise.

In hind sight, the job requirement was simply too high for me.
How about AshS in his CTO job? CSDoctor's job? S.Liu's job?

If I were to benchmark myself with these so-called peers, or try to increase my brank, and join the exclub, I would get derailed, lose my carefree ezlife, take on lots of stress. 
If I try, could I become a software architect? Not my strength.
If I try, could I become a lead developer like AshS? Not sure. 

At my age, I have an implicit self-conviction that most of the higher-paying positions are too stressful, with exorbitant expectation.
My EPA job would be sgd 160k in another company.
What I'm unsure is the salary hike if I jump. What additional income is possible? After tax, 100k/Y additional? Not worth it.

I told grandpa that my successE [carefree ezlife + harmony, based on wellness and comfortable livelihood] is rare among my cohort, not because I'm wealthier than them, but because I don't focus on the wrong goals.

The nightmare scenario is much more severe, harsh, harmful than CB2022.

-- slow-cooking new: career insecurity: 2017 watershed
t_vague
2017 marked a watershed in my perception of career insecurity.
Before the watershed, I had a learned insecurity, instilled in me due to decades of brainwash, and internalized.

tech churn .. defeating any attempt of accumulation
The widespread and entrenched notion that "Few can remain hands-on till 40."
threat from younger or stronger competitors.
DRam refresh .. and maintain your critical mass
strengthen your moat, maintain your lead 
Don't drop out from the leading pack.
slow income growth outpaced by long-term inflation not only in home prices.

I felt like the EDB -- can't afford to slow down, due to the risk of getting outrun/outmaneuvered, or caught up... The risk of losing our relevance.

After the watershed, I could see the end of my involuntary marathon. Now am planning my own light marathon driven by successZ. 
This marathon could take me all the way to 70s. 
I hope to enjoy it.
Therefore, for the remainder of the marathon I could afford to slow down to a stroll, drop out of the leading pakc, and let other people overtake me
as happend in Toa Payoh stadium.

I told SY.C that my 100k/Y dev-till70 is not passive acceptance and failureZ, because I still make an effort -- a light marathon.
