--new: xp staying on after PIP, with dignity
GS: informal, unofficial PIP. After it, I stayed for close to a year.

Stirt: I overcame the setback at end of 2014 and scored Meet/Meet but without a bonus. 

Now I think it is possible to stay on with dignity and pride.
I hope at my age now, I grow older and wiser, less sensitive less vulnerable, more mellow more robust, or even more resilient

* am proud of my initiative.

Even if no one says anything positive about it, it's still a worthwhile lesson

--new jolt: VP^contractor: lower stress]U.S.
After hibernation, for the first few years in the U.S. quite possibly my stress level (and wife's) would grow.

Would a contract job or a VP job give me stress relief? Clearly, contract job feels lighter, despite the lower salary and lower job security.

Boss personality is the biggest wildcard, but I would say job nature (esp. expectation) is crucial. VPs are benchmarked and ranked. As contractor, I think renewal based on budget is the main appraisal.

--fuxi: old-timers and attachment
My contractor mentality shows a healthy dose of detachment

For all my career esp. after 35, my competitive strengths in theoretical + details are evergreen advantages in tech IV.

speed coding is less of "my game"

Programming is all about details.

--fuxi:
my daily sense of "good work" depends mostly on 
AA) visible output
BB) my own sacrifice, sometimes invisible. Factors inlucde the amount of hours I spend in office

Without BB, sometimes I feel a bit guilty, but usually I feel proud of myself.
