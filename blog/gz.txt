Using words and numbers, am trying to "capture" my perceptions (intuitions, observations and hopefully a bit of insights) of the c++/java job market trends. There's some reality out there but each person including the expert observer has only a limited view of that reality, based on limited data.

Those numbers look impressive, but actually similar to the words -- they are mostly personal perceptions dressed up as objective measurements.

If you don't use words or numbers then you can't capture any observation of the "reality". Your impression of that reality (without words you can't even refer to that reality) remains hopelessly vague. I now believe vague is the lowest level of comprehension, usually as bad as a biased comprehension. Using words + numbers we have a chance to improve our perception.

my perceptions shape my decisions, and my decisions affect my family's life chances.

my perceptions shape my selective listening. Gradually, actively, my selective listening would modify my "membrane"! All great thinkers, writers update their membrane.

Am not analyzing reality. Instead, 
Am basically analyzing my perception of the reality, but that's the best I could do. I'm good at analyzing myself as an object.

Refusing to plan because of high uncertainty is lazy, is pessimistic, is doomed.

--update blogpost: every time I try the SG job market, recruiters would tell me there are so many "new" employers or new markets, but invariably, i need to focus on the old guards .. mostly ibanks, as the new market is not open to me.

This is similar to Deepak, Shanyou trying the wall St c++ job market.

(I used to update the blog directly, searching for multiple suitable blogposts... time consuming)
