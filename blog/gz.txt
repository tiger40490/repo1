There is nothing really new in this 2023 situation:
trigger 2 (PIP): for various reasons you can lose your job security .. see bpost on epa job security.

trigger 1 (JIV competence): job candidates from bccy and web2.0 exodus are becoming stronger in the competitive JIV esp. CIV. I doubt they are better at GTD though, and many of the bright young talents have itchy feet. 
Their itchy feet don't make them less attractive to employers, as many employers want a chance to wow them with "career prospect".
The older ones (35+) would hesitate to change industry and forgo their accumulated domain experience

Franklin's opinion: career insecurity is a permanent and fundamental fact of life, even when your recent experience make you feel somehow shielded from the storms/blackholes, as if in a bubble. 

Appreciation of impermanence and keen awareness of hazards is healthy, but fearful attachment could grow into a shackle.

Don't neglect any of the above, but focus on 1) doing a good job 2) body-building for JIV.

Q: I have a special arrangement where Credit Suisse pays for my children's school fees - will the arrangement be honored?

-- update or new: how do immigration authorities identify elite talent
For academic talent, research output would be the criterion used by immigration authorities (same as an academic employer). However, most elite talents are not academic.

Criterion: education credentials. "Top 100 unviersity" lend more credibility than just about anything else
Criterion: salary, as decided by an employer with due diligence

-- new: inflated SWE wages: SG context ... or update bpost on "value creation by software industry"
Trigger: IT fresh grads are paid $5k+ ((SWE? still higher), higher than fresh grads in engineering, accountancy, architect,,,

Many employers face a tough choice -- hire more experienced SWE (even costlier), outsource (including packaged solutions), or stay low-tech/laggard as in emerging economies.

YiFei said IT grad starting salary has always been rather high, but not sure how sustainable.

I feel SWE freshers should get ... $3k, whereas old timers should get ... below 10k. Now, with my current inflated salary, 
* need to prepare for wage drop long before retirement
* need to adjust and strengthen my devTill70 plan
* I anticipate lower calibre among coworkers in the same 
* I anticipate a possible drop in per-worker workload.... Employers have to moderate the pressure applied on SWE staff.

-- update which bpost?
Fresh grads paid higher than old-timers ... is common esp. in "ageist sectors" like sports, showbiz and tech.

Even a 25 year old can be underpaid compared to a fresher.
--new:
fierce competition for tech talent, increasing salary, 30% increments to job hoppers...

However, you (the tech talent) must perform (at JIV and) on the job. If you fail to live up to the expectation, over a few months or a few years, you would be thrown out.

I experienced it in Qz and Macq.

What you really want is "lower workload, rather than higher salary", but this is bucking the trend in the job market. You can get to such a job by
* staying in less desirable/popular domains, rather than hot domains with higher talent concentration
* staying in your comfort zone (Yes) while slowly taking up TSN
* staying as a foot soldier, not moving up, without ambition

-- update https://btv-gz.dreamhosters.com/31965/big-contractfte/ or new: free agent^FTE: salary gap
when a corporate salesman or teacher/tutor goes independent i.e. becomes a free agent, usually she forgoes long-term career growth, and sometimes income growth. 

Q: what happened in my case, in my WStC career?
A: I don't aim at high position anyway, so am not giving up much by going independent. So my WStC career was good enough, fat-n-happy, even though not as lucrative as some FTEs.

Q: why has my income stayed so high even though I was free agent for most of my WSt career? I see multile factors
A: factor: salary inflation among some SWE sectors. WSt is one very specific sector and it has a visible moat, just as the web2.0 domain
A: factor: I have something of a killer skill for the lucrative domain of WSt. As an analog, a specialist doctor has a killer skill.

Actually, more important than salary is the workload [work stress, expectation, lateral benchmarking]. At my age, I don't need 200k salary as much as WLB. 
For WLB, free agent is usually superior, but good in my current FTE job. 

-- update bpost on workload, but which one?
worker's skill and efficiency is a big unknown factor to a new project manager. 
The longer you stay, the more efficient you become as a worker, but expectation on you also rises, as manager knows your skills better.

-- LG2 update bpost on feel`satisfied more than peers .... or the later bpost on "by half"
in a 2022 nightmare, I rejoined Macq and was dismissed again. 
I did my best again, but again was shown to be the weakest in the team, although another set of requirements may prove otherwise.

In hind sight, the Macq job requirement was simply too high for me, more than the Qz job or GS job.
How about AshS in his CTO job? CSDoctor's job? S.Liu's job?

If I were to benchmark myself with these so-called peers, or try to increase my brank, and join the exclub, I would get derailed, lose my carefree ezlife, take on lots of stress. 
If I try, could I become a software architect? Not my strength.
If I try, could I become a lead developer like AshS? Not sure. 

At my age, I have an implicit self-conviction that most of the higher-paying positions are too stressful, with exorbitant expectation.
What I'm unsure is the salary hike of a "jump". (My EPA job would be worth sgd 160k in another company.) What additional income is possible? After tax, 100k/Y additional? Not worth it.

I told grandpa that my successE [carefree ezlife + harmony, based on wellness and comfortable livelihood] is rare among my cohort, not because I'm wealthier than them, but because I don't focus on the wrong goals.

The nightmare scenario is much more severe, harsh, harmful than CB2022.

-- slow-cooking new: Qz (^EPA) episode: inferiority-complex
t_selfEval
I had a deep-rooted inferiority complex across the q3SG perm jobs.
Therefore, before I started on EPA job, I braced myself for the same, and I was actively planning a return to U.S. within 2Y.

Q: How has my inferiority evolved? Note this self-eval question requires lots of Sys2 resources. Many individuals won't bother digging into the various factors (of inferiority) even though inferiority seriously affects our wellbeing.

Factor: appr by manager, in terms of comp numbers, relative importance in the team, and other things. This appr drives that inferiority complex.

Factor: localSys... is now slightly less important in the grand scheme of things. In StirtTech team, I was inferior in terms of localSys (which should have been accepted by mgr + the team). I couldn't follow a lot of the conversations. Mvea and EPA team... pretty much the same. 
(Aha) my EPA compensation is convincing evidence of manager's acceptance of my localSys.
Also, Sachin's localSys didn't earn much appr.

Factor: VP peer benchmark ... esp. in terms of localSys and value-add. Benchmark breeds inferiority. I have never wanted to be benchmarked with VPs. At RTS and Mvea, I was never benchmarked with VPs. In EPA, I try not to care or observe. I tell myself that we are all (informally) evaluated, all the time, by everyone but I'm older and less capable. I do that to fend off the inferiority.
