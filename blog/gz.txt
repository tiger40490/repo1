I have a bit of critical mass on socket IV.

Those writing networking/socket programs outside C are on the sidelilne/peripheral. Those programming languages depend on the C API. C++ class/template libraries are in a similar situation. All of them are too high-level.

Therefore, I believe my socket QQ interview questions are alien to these candidates.

for many peers (LS, Sunil, CNA...), the main goal is higher income but for me dev-till-70 is more useful.

Contract job market is better for me not THEM.

java is one of the best tech domains. I can stick to java (keeping c++ critical mass). THEY may need to accept some corporate technology stack like cloud or Qz or data analytics.

Tech IV skills (coding drill and QQ) are absolutely essential to me not THEM.

-- new: back to home town like a king
LS once shared his view that at the same salary (say, 200k) in the U.S. he would be somewhat affluent, but in China he would be super rich in comparison with his /fellow countrymen/. I guess this is a fundamental (therefore powerful) motivator for some people in my circle.

As a less extreme but more widespread case, the covid19 economic fallout puts some tech workers in an enviable position relative to their fellow countrymen.

Q: is it intrinsic or extrinsic motivation? Not sureQ: how is FOMO related? I think in U.S. he would feel the FOMO fear but in China he would be the target of envy.

Why I bother with this question? Because this is a subtle factor in my choice of the country for my family

.. BGC and Cambodia experiences:
For a few days I did live like such a king, but the feeling was not really satisfying.

.. brbr: To me, when comparing U.S. vs "lower" countries, BRBR is more important than this factor.

My PIP experience was truly traumatic with permant scars, but my benchtime experiences were extremely light in comparison:

* before Polaris
* between 95G and Barcap
* between RTS and mvea

Most people who claim an expertise do have some expertise, even if exaggerated slightly. Most audience won't bother to verify the credentials.

My UChicago GPA is 100% authentic. In a fast-moving market, credibility and assurance from known-brands matter. Probably needed it in a declining phase of my career. It's insurance protection for my career.

My java/c++ QQ knowledge is not advanced expertise, but is enough to pass many external benchmarks.

For all my career esp. after 35, my competitive strengths in theoretical + details are evergreen and vital advantages in tech IV.

Performance (including bigO, but excluding field turning) is all about details.

In contrast, speed coding is less of "my game". It is like a sprint race for a footballer.
