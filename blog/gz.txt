-- fuxi or update ...: 
Whether we use tbl or Genepai, I would have a relatively comfortable timeline... Am lucky.

when I feel stressed about Genepai progress, I can feel relieved that the two full-time young devs didn't find a better solution than mine.

Apparently, there's no yardstick to guage progress.
However, Genepai made enough progress (albeit small) to /earn/ multiple business trips between Sgp and NYC.

The deliverable is a dream. If you show effort and make *some* progress, then they would probably reward you for trying.

Other AI projects in EqTech rarely have any full-time devs. 

Every challenge in Genepai is my problem, but the 2 of them are supposed to help out, so it's fine to delegate to them, while I design high-level things and take on modules that are hard to delegate.

If one of them becomes better than me and more productive than me, that can be a good thing. Manager should not penalize me.

If they become independent and can contribute productively, I think managers would be delighted.
