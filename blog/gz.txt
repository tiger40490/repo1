-- fuxi: XiaoYan meet-up
XiaoYan is a very kind lady. I guess she decided to spend 1.5 hours learning about the world outside PSA, and sharing experiences and observations. As I told her, this meet-up turned out be an insightful, reflective career counselling session. She was a helpful mirror. I revealed a lot of my fears, setbacks, weaknesses,,, and received substantial support.

She suggested that job stability could become a G3 priority for my next job search in Singapore. PSA and OC are stable -- management are extremely reluctant to retrench, even for non-performing employees.

She shared that age concern over a 55-year-old candidate (8-Y career runway ) is a real concern at hiring discussions.

I reveald that my salary is now "very high" by my standard, possibly overpaid, so much so that I don't mind buying her a juice. She pointed out that unlike many people in such situations, I'm conscientious about the possibility of "overpaid without heavy workload or contribution". Deep inside, I felt a warm pat on the back.

She asked why I prefer SGP to U.S. if I could find the same after-tax salary (after adjusting for cost of living). I mentioned close to grandparents, Chinese population (better for wife), better government support, weather,,, I forgot to mention driving, street safety, 

I realized that I have become more loyal, less opinionated,,,, as I age, but I still reject the widespread advice to "put up with worsening job situation for as long as you can tolerate"

-- fuxi or update ...: 
Whether we use tbl or Genepai, I would have a relatively comfortable timeline... Am lucky.

when I feel stressed about Genepai progress, I can feel relieved that the two full-time young devs didn't find a better solution than mine.

Apparently, there's no yardstick to guage progress.
However, Genepai made enough progress (albeit small) to /earn/ multiple business trips between Sgp and NYC.

The deliverable is a dream. If you show effort and make *some* progress, then they would probably reward you for trying.

Other AI projects in EqTech rarely have any full-time devs. 

Every challenge in Genepai is my problem, but the 2 of them are supposed to help out, so it's fine to delegate to them, while I design high-level things and take on modules that are hard to delegate.

If one of them becomes better than me and more productive than me, that can be a good thing. Manager should not penalize me.

If they become independent and can contribute productively, I think managers would be delighted.
