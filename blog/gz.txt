-- LG2 update bpost on feel`satisfied more than peers or the later bpost on "by half"
in a 2022 nightmare, I rejoined Macq and was dismissed again. 
I did my best but again was shown to be the weakest in the team, although another set of requirements may prove otherwise.

In hind sight, the Macq job requirement was simply too high for me.
How about AshS in his CTO job? CSDoctor's job? S.Liu's job?

If I were to benchmark myself with these so-called peers, or try to increase my brank, and join the exclub, I would get derailed, lose my carefree ezlife, take on lots of stress. 
If I try, could I become a software architect? Not my strength.
If I try, could I become a lead developer like AshS? Not sure. 

At my age, I have an implicit self-conviction that most of the higher-paying positions are too stressful, with exorbitant expectation.
What I'm unsure is the salary hike of a "jump". (My EPA job would be worth sgd 160k in another company.) What additional income is possible? After tax, 100k/Y additional? Not worth it.

I told grandpa that my successE [carefree ezlife + harmony, based on wellness and comfortable livelihood] is rare among my cohort, not because I'm wealthier than them, but because I don't focus on the wrong goals.

The nightmare scenario is much more severe, harsh, harmful than CB2022.

In my view, the main threats to my job are 1) Compliance 2) quality 

You probably agree that project completion speed is not a "threat" in itself, but you felt idleness can be recorded and used against me when layoff pressure builds up. Well, a boss would protect those subordinates doing a good enough job and not making trouble. Being idle half the time is not always embarrassing. Many people in many teams are also idle for days and weeks. 

Some time ago, I did ask a colleague (and close friend) "Who are on the so-called good list? Who are on the not-so-good list (at risk in a downturn)?" He felt I was not at risk. Not sure what signs he saw. For job security risks, I believe the best indicators are 1) year-end numbers 2) continuous feedback messages. These two vital signs are both stable/strong for the past 2 years, so I don't worry about job security.

Some can receive a big raise then get laid off (earning the increased salary temporarily), but I think it's rare.

It's hard to quantify idleness vs busy-ness
* efficient workers .. some workers need only half the budgeted time to finish a project, and use the remaining time as personal time. That's not a problem in itself. She should not affect colleagues' productivity, though.
* chitchat .. hours of chitchat in office can be part of "relationship building"... Is that idleness?
* quality .. not captured in any "quantifying" system, but quality is arguably more important (to users, to the company) than idleness/busy-ness. Some top employers are reported to give engineers light workload so they can focus on producing quality products. In contrast, China firms practice 996 -- the opposite of idleness
* wasted work .. not captured in any "quantifying" system. In many investment banks I served, a lot of engineer man-days are spent building products that nobody uses in the end. These engineers are not idle. Same for the 996 shops.
* multiple websites on browsers .. any quantifying system would see plenty of users having 20+ sites open on browsers. Some sites are work-related. No one knows how much time is spent on each site. 
* offline working .. not captured, including verbal, whiteboard or print media. 
* working from home .. many people multi-task between work and parenting/chores etc. Hard to quantify number of work hours. 
* weekend/evening hours .. some (like me) spend hours in the office on weekends; telecommuters work late into evenings. Some number of those hours are spent on work projects, but I don't remember how many, and employer doesn't record. 

Instead of tracking idleness, managers are better off tracking projects. If a worker is fast and good quality, then don't care about her chitchats, idle browsing, flexible hours... Live and let live.

Since 2019, my favorite blogging topics are often borderline work-related:
1) time management, prioritizing, self-improvement, motivation, conflict resolution
2) learning technology + global work cultures, career planning, coping strategies, job markets, interviews
3) personal/family finance + general finance .. cost saving, home improvement, investing, 
4) wellness .. including stress, self-care
5) parenting + education

The livelihood impact is a smallish one-time impact. "Detachment" needed here, including numeric comparisons with past jobs.
In contrast, the symbolic meaning of the bonus allocation must not be brushed aside. 
Bonus pool is limited, so for every dollar allocated to me, someone else has received a dollar less. 
Manager sends a very important message.

-- slow cooking new: employee benefits: addicted
Trigger event: move the CapitaSpring the fancy new office

Ever since I graduated and started work at local employers and small employers, I have witnessed increasingly /lavish/luxurious staff benefits. 
I often feel pampered, then self-pressured to "deliver" and "perform", to deserve these benefits.
As soon as you leave the firm (for whatever reasons) these luxuries disappear, unless next employer offer the same.

[[work a little less, live a little more]] described corporate high-fliers addicted to "busy-ness" [overworked, reliable and indispensible]. 
I guess these high-fliers grow (addicted and) reliant on many staff benefits to support their busy-ness: 

medical leave without MC requirement
medical consultation (cashless) at any clinic "close to wherever you are"
24H access to nice office (my harbor, my addiction)
flexible hours (my addiction)
remote connectivity from home + vacation
printing (my addiction)
extra monitors in office and home
unlimited IDD

-- slow-cooking new: Qz (^EPA) episode: inferiority-complex
t_selfEval
I had a deep-rooted inferiority complex across the q3SG perm jobs.
Therefore, before I started on EPA job, I braced myself for the same, and I was actively planning a return to U.S. within 2Y.

Q: How has my inferiority evolved? Note this self-eval question requires lots of Sys2 resources. Many individuals won't bother digging into the various factors (of inferiority) even though inferiority seriously affects our wellbeing.

Factor: appr by manager, in terms of comp numbers, relative importance in the team, and other things. This appr drives that inferiority complex.

Factor: localSys... is now slightly less important in the grand scheme of things. In StirtTech team, I was inferior in terms of localSys (which should have been accepted by mgr + the team). I couldn't follow a lot of the conversations. Mvea and EPA team... pretty much the same. 
(Aha) my EPA compensation is convincing evidence of manager's acceptance of my localSys.
Also, Sachin's localSys didn't earn much appr.

Factor: VP peer benchmark ... esp. in terms of localSys and value-add. Benchmark breeds inferiority. I have never wanted to be benchmarked with VPs. At RTS and Mvea, I was never benchmarked with VPs. In EPA, I try not to care or observe. I tell myself that we are all (informally) evaluated, all the time, by everyone but I'm older and less capable. I do that to fend off the inferiority.
