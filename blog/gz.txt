==I pointed out that zbs is vague, compared to QQ and GTD.
Many zbs learning experiences (me or DQH) were arguably irrelevant if never quizzed.

--iv questions on malloc, tmalloc and the facebook malloc
In latency benchmarks, c++ should simply 1) avoid DMA or 2) pre-allocate. Therefore, if the iv question touches on benchmark, then the malloc question become moot.

--iv questions on lockfree in c++
messier and more low-level than lockfree in jvm. I would say lockfree is seldom written by a c++ app developer. Therefore not a GTD topic at all. Purely QQ halo topic.

--iv question on volatile
Again, many interviewers use volative as concurrency feature in c++ but it's non-standard !  Even if it has a side effect if using gcc, the practice is "not something I would recommend", though I won't criticize hiring team's current practice.

--iv question on throwing dtor
c++ standard says UDB but still some interviewers ask about it. So this topic is not zbs not GTD but really QQ

--iv question on debugger breakpoint
Not GTD, not even zbs

--iv question (GS-HK) on CAS no slower than uncontended lock acquisition
I feel I don't need to know how much faster. My knowledge is good enough for GTD

--iv question on how many clock cycles per instruction
no GTD but zbs for a latency enthusiast
