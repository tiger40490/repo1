--update blogpost on semi-retirement jobs
I wanted a semi-retirement job with reasonable salary, but low calibre, low workload, low pace. SXA said Oracle has some deparments (or job functions) like that but these jobs are unstable. 

I said my experience at Citi gave me that impression. SXA said he has interactions with some backend Citi departments such as the online banking backend:
* mission critical
* many approvals and controls.. lengthy process.. therefore slow pace
* low or no green-field element. Mostly maintenance.
* complex legacy system
* Some bachelors can spend many hours every day with the system

For all my career esp. after 35, my competitive strengths in theoretical + details are evergreen and vital advantages in tech IV.

Performance (including bigO, but excluding field turning) is all about details.

In contrast, speed coding is less of "my game". It is like a sprint race for a footballer.

Daily sense@goodWork
my daily sense of "good work" depends mostly on 
AA) visible output, visible to boss and other people
BB) my own sacrifice, sometimes invisible. Factors inlucde the amount of hours I spend in office

AA is dominant.

Without BB, sometimes I feel a bit guilty, but usually I feel proud of myself.
