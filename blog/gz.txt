-- new: gr8 application to own
Indispensible
complex but not too complex
complexity appreciated by mgr
central, not isolated .. FSV2, event handlers, 
My personal strength .. nothing in EPA 

-- fuxi
I feel overworked and not appreciated enough

Need to reduce actual work hours, while I maintain or even increase my quiet hours in office.

尽职尽责 .. tell boss I need to leave earlier and need more time for my projects

-- new or update bpost on opaque^transparency.. which bpost?
After you gain insight into an otherwise opaque system, then your job security and career security improves to some extent, depending on 

* How indispensible/crucial/central/redundant is that opaque system?
* Across industries, how widely used is that opaque system? Murex? Spring? Aeron? Majority of opaque systems are localSys
* rarity of your insight .. Are you a one-man show? VolFitter requires more math:)
* depth of your insight. 
* longevity of the opaque system and its accu and churn-resistance
* crying baby .. PMA takes up work hours and can let me demonstrate my knowledge and book my hours :) In contrast, Nautilus is not a crying baby :(

c++ is deeper and more opaque than java. Shell/perl/python are usually less opaque but python can become opaque as described in another bpost.

How about PMA? Not so opaque; indispensible; one-man show

-- fuxi or new: localSys ^ high-churn domains
portable t-investment .. zero for localSys 
engaging .. high-churn could be more exciting
market value .. zero for localSys

-- fuxi: I used to enjoy/exploit my perl/SQL/unix GTD "superpower"
I often find a secret killer skill in perl and shell as a power drill when facing a stone wall in project. 

advanced git is popular
shell scripting remains evergreen.
git-bash is useful for me, but not used by others
Nowadays advanced SQL is relevant only in places like PWM. Perl is only used for one-liners.
remote debugg .. Un-usalbe 50% the time when I need it. Live debugger is not as reliable as static command line tools.
One good use of remote debugging is .. revealing at least one way a method is used.
