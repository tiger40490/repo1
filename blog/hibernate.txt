--try DRW, GS, FB?
Receiving a job offer from Goog, DRW, Tower, GS etc would have an extremely positive impact on my self image, even if I don't join them or salary is low.

The boost to self-image is probably much higher than expected and rather hard to measure.

Remember as I age my attractiveness to these employers would decline

--tower and zuhlke:
i told shuo that his first attempt may not work out but could be a training experience, but are we still at the training age? Self-assessment

if you stay within familiar domain, there's no chance of gaining some valuable zbs. Low latency java@MLP is not completely familiar domain.

for both the architect role and the Tower role, the expectation could be too high, but who knows where I may find strengths. 
When I was younger (30's?) i was more fearless on technical ground. 
Now I'm kinda bogged down by negative experiences. 
Technical challenges at GS, Qz, Macq were not really higher than 95G, Barcap, OC and RTS, but the negative feedback "rebased" my self-assessment.

I feel in many (if not all) cases, some may say i did a decent job.
* Qz had a meet/meet assessment and my mgr (Sundip) liked my performance in the X'mas season.

--zuhlke is better than redmart
more exposure
possibly more reputable project 

A zuhlke offer would be a great 2nd offer.

--zuhlke vs MLP
In Mar 2017, when I tried UBS vol-risk java job at Stamford, I was hoping the salary premium would boost my self esteem, even though I felt I wouldn't learn much in that project.

In hindsight, I feel lucky I didn't go there. The RTS c++ experience proved to be more rewarding, even strategic.

I now feel Zuhlke could prove more rewarding than MLP.

--Q: is MLP better than SCB?
A: Yes in terms of 1) reputation risk 4) connectivity, low-latency java
A: No in terms of 2) coworkerBenchmark/stigma 3) c++ 

Is java going to be easier? I said java was one of the top 3 factors of PIP.

I may not join an HFT but an HFT c++ offer would be a boost to my confidence for years to come.
Remember I did 10+ HFT c++ interviews
--HFT vs non-finance
Risk is the deciding factor. 

For MLP, Tower, Jump etc, I foresee high expectation/risk of stigma + PIP etc, but luckily I have a "knee guard" that I am inexperienced in this field and much older.

Pollen allergy ..

For a non-finance shop like Zuhlke, I estimate workload is lower, calibre is lower. Also I have a bigger "knee guard".

On the positive side, I think inet experience might give me some insight but remember previous TSN attempts at eq-OMS, quant, drv-pricing, dotnet.

I would still stay away from banks (including SCB) to safeguard my reputation

--notes on hibernate timing
get an offer by Sep, before end of season, so I can spend more time with grandparents and also save my 6Y. The more years I have remaining, the more "attractive" I am among h1 candidates

Luckily, my MS job is stable and stress-free, 
* with remote work flexibility
* with c++ contexx

After receiving an offer
* need to discuss GC with Jay
* accept offer and start background check
* once background clears, inform Greg and MS

--for Josh
Consider giving him a heads up. He would appreciate it? Consult GregR.

Consider taking some half-day leaves.

--propose to Jay
beware of information leak. Better send after getting some SG offers

Hi Jay,

Here's a new proposal
* I will take an unpaid sabbatical for 20+ months
starting Aug 2019
* will rejoin CEM in 2021, on my own to set things up for the family. I will then bring my family over before my son turns 13 in Aug 2019.

Reason 1: to spend a few years with my aging parents. My last chance, as my dad is too old to spend time with us in the U.S.
Reason 2: More Chinese education for my kids, but my son needs to leave Singapore before turning 13 to avoid a heavy NationalService liability deposit
Reason (minor): income and cost -- there's cost saving in living with family. Please note higher salary is not so important to me. As you know I have walked away from higher offers many times (Morgan Stanley, Pimco etc). I'm impressed with your flexibility, efficiency and trustworthiness so I plan to stay with your firm when I return.

Legal questions:
Q: My priority date will be unaffected since CEM will keep my i-140?

--email already sent out
今天收到美国移民部 I-140 批准函， 我正式完成绿卡过程第二阶段。 再等上几年就可以拿绿卡了。 I-140 批准意味着我可以选择换雇主调高薪水， 也可考虑回新工作几年。

2021年8月大宝13岁前要离新赴美 （以避免 $75000 兵役押金）。 美国9月开学， 可以5-7月来， 暖和。

在纽约换雇主..据说不难。 我不急。

回新最早2019年8月， 最晚 12 月。 几个原因：

* 工作压力： 目前很舒服， 值得珍惜。 
* 收入： 回新可能高一些， 但在纽约换雇主也可提薪， 而不换工作。
* 开支： 回新可以省 每月 $2000 左右 包括女佣，房租，机票
* 家人团聚： 目前几个月飞一次感觉很不错。 难得老板允许我在新加坡上班。
* 找工作 11 月开始淡季， 因此最晚 2019年10月找到工作， 最多要求推迟2个月上班。 
* 如果 2019年10月没找到工作，就2020年初再试。 不理想 -- 浪费我仅有的 6 年自由。 幸好仅浪费几个月。
