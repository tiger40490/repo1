Q: how long can I hold off returning to U.S.?
Q: if I get GC but stay outside U.S. for years what happens to my GC?

--zuhlke vs MLP
In Mar 2017, when I tried UBS vol-risk java job at Stamford, I was hoping the salary premium would boost my self esteem, even though I felt I wouldn't learn much in that project.

In hindsight, I feel lucky I didn't go there. The RTS c++ experience proved to be more rewarding, even strategic.

I now feel Zuhlke could prove more rewarding than MLP.

--tower and zuhlke:
i told shuo that his first attempt may not work out but could be a training experience, but are we still at the training age? Self-assessment

if you stay within familiar domain, there's no chance of gaining some valuable zbs. Low latency java@MLP is not completely familiar domain.

for both the architect role and the Tower role, the expectation could be too high, but who knows where I may find strengths. 
When I was younger (30's?) i was more fearless on technical ground. 
Now I'm kinda bogged down by negative experiences. 
Technical challenges at GS, Qz, Macq were not really higher than 95G, Barcap, OC and RTS, but the negative feedback "rebased" my self-assessment.

今天收到美国移民部 I-140 批准函， 我正式完成绿卡过程第二阶段。 再等上几年就可以拿绿卡了。 I-140 批准意味着我可以选择换雇主调高薪水， 也可考虑回新工作几年。

2021年8月大宝13岁前要离新赴美 （以避免 $75000 兵役押金）。 美国9月开学， 可以5-7月来， 暖和。

在纽约换雇主..据说不难。 我不急。

回新最早2019年8月， 最晚 12 月。 几个原因：

* 工作压力： 目前很舒服， 值得珍惜。 
* 收入： 回新可能高一些， 但在纽约换雇主也可提薪， 而不换工作。
* 开支： 回新可以省 每月 $2000 左右 包括女佣，房租，机票
* 家人团聚： 目前几个月飞一次感觉很不错。 难得老板允许我在新加坡上班。
* 找工作 11 月开始淡季， 因此最晚 2019年10月找到工作， 最多要求推迟2个月上班。 
* 如果 2019年10月没找到工作，就2020年初再试。 不理想 -- 浪费我仅有的 6 年自由。 幸好仅浪费几个月。
