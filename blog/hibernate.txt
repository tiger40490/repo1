--HFT interviews will take precious time but i won't join them... better postpone
mobile app shops ... are lighter load for me.

--v.tanSgVol.doc:
need to reduce financial jargon
--dynamic languages in the SG tech shops
the inet shops remind me of the dotcom days when perl, php, lotus notes, cold fusion all compete with cpp/java.

These dynamic languages have no depth, no accu, would all fall out of favor. The market will have one dominant dynamic language , probably python

--Q: is MLP better than SCB?
A: Yes in terms of 1) reputation risk and 4) salary
A: No in terms of 2) coworkerBenchmark/stigma 3) c++

How about a DRW offer?
consider seeking some HFT c++ offers after I secure a realistic offer. 
If no coding round, then chance of HFT c++ offer is above 50%
I may not join an HFT but an HFT c++ offer would be a boost to my confidence for years to come.
Remember I did 10+ HFT c++ interviews
--MLP vs non-finance
Risk is the main factor. 

For MLP, I foresee high risk of stigma/PIP etc, but luckily I have a "knee guard" that I am inexperienced in this field and much older.

For a non-finance shop, I estimate workload is lower, calibre is lower. Also I have a bigger "knee guard".

I would still stay away from banks (including SCB) to safeguard my reputation

--could consider trying ByteDance and GoJack just to practice dealing with these non-finance shops

Avoid the coding assignment due to tcost

--notes on hibernate timing
get an offer by Sep, before end of season, so I can spend more time with grandparents and also save my 6Y. The more years I have remaining, the more "attractive" I am among h1 candidates

I think tech companies also have hiring seasons.

Luckily, my MS job is stable and stress-free, 
* with remote work flexibility
* with c++ contexx
... but I don't want to slow down my job search. I want to stay focused and motivated.
--propose to Jay
beware of information leak. Better send after getting some SG offers

Hi Jay,

Here's a new proposal
* I will take an unpaid sabbatical for about 20 months
starting Jul (or Aug..) 2019
* will rejoin CEM in spring 2021, on my own to set things up for the family. I will then bring my family over before my son turns 13 in Aug 2019.

Reason 1: to spend a few years with my aging parents. My last chance, as my dad is too old travel to the U.S.
Reason 2: More Chinese education for my kids, but my son needs to leave Singapore before turning 13 to avoid a heavy NationalService liability deposit
Reason : My h1b 6-year cap is limited. It's advantageous for me to save it by waiting for my green card outside U.S. I can "recapture" the 20 months spent outside the U.S.
Reason (minor): income and cost -- there's cost saving in living with family. Please note higher salary is not so important to me. As you know I have walked away from higher offers many times (Morgan Stanley, Pimco etc). I'm impressed with your flexibility, efficiency and trustworthiness so I plan to stay with your firm when I return.

Legal questions:
Q: My priority date will be unaffected since CEM won't revoke my i-140?

My decision is not finalized. If no good plan, then I can bring my family over in 2019 or 2020.

今天收到美国移民部 I-140 批准函， 我正式完成绿卡过程第二阶段。 再等上几年就可以拿绿卡了。 I-140 批准意味着我可以选择换雇主调高薪水， 也可考虑回新工作几年。

2021年8月大宝13岁前要离新赴美 （以避免 $75000 兵役押金）。 美国9月开学， 可以5-7月来， 暖和。

在纽约换雇主..据说不难。 我不急。

回新最早2019年8月， 最晚 12 月。 几个原因：

* 工作压力： 目前很舒服， 值得珍惜。 
* 收入： 回新可能高一些， 但在纽约换雇主也可提薪， 而不换工作。
* 开支： 回新可以省 每月 $2000 左右 包括女佣，房租，机票
* 家人团聚： 目前几个月飞一次感觉很不错。 难得老板允许我在新加坡上班。
* 找工作 11 月开始淡季， 因此最晚 2019年10月找到工作， 最多要求推迟2个月上班。 
* 如果 2019年10月没找到工作，就2020年初再试。 不理想 -- 浪费我仅有的 6 年自由。 幸好仅浪费几个月。
