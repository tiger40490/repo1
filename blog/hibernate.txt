Can we be slightly more positive about next job prospect?
In each recent job experience, the positive seems dwarfed by the negative. 
Many of the recent jobs ended in visible failure.

In 2017, when I tried UBS vol-risk java, I was hoping the salary premium would boost my self esteem, even though I felt I wouldn't learn much in that project.

In hindsight, I feel lucky I didn't go there. The RTS c++ experience proved to be more rewarding.

I think Zuhlke would prove more rewarding than MLP.

now that my job search hits resistance, 

* I feel so lucky to have the comfortable job in mvea team and 
** the flexibility to work in SGP
** stable job 
** although time isn't really on my side... I can afford to wait.

* i feel so lucky to have the mlg offer
** high salary, proves my worth and earning capacity

* I feel so lucky to have the SCB offer
** high salary, proves my worth and earning capacity

for both the architect role and the Tower role, the expectation could be too high, but who knows where I may find strengths. 
When I was younger (30's?) i was more fearless on technical ground. 
Now I'm kinda bogged by negative experiences. 
Technical challenges at GS, Qz, Macq were not really higher than 95G, Barcap, OC and RTS, but the negative feedback "rebased" my self-assessment.

I feel in many (if not all) cases, some may say i did a decent job.
* Qz had a meet/meet assessment and my mgr (Sundip) liked my performance in the X'mas season.
--zuhlke is better than redmart
more exposure
possibly more reputable project 

--tower and zuhlke:
i told shuo that his first attempt may not work out but could be a training experience

if you stay within familiar domain, there's no chance of gaining some valuable zbs
--new blogpost: GS tech challenge !! beyond  me
* GS challenge was tough but i conquered it convincingly!

Everyone said I was good enough. 

I even convinced many that I was a technical strong player in my team.
(Perhaps Chad was even stronger but that doesn't change the above fact -- consider Roger Federa.)
--consider giving Josh a heads up that I need to start looking for a SGP job. 
I would then try some west coast jobs in NY. Hopefully get an offer without taking it.

--Q: is MLP better than SCB?
A: Yes in terms of 1) reputation risk 4) connectivity
A: No in terms of 2) coworkerBenchmark/stigma 3) c++ 

Is java going to be easier? I said java was one of the top 3 explanations of PIP.

How about a DRW offer?
consider seeking some HFT c++ offers after I secure a realistic offer.
 
If no coding round, then chance of HFT c++ offer is above 50%

I may not join an HFT but an HFT c++ offer would be a boost to my confidence for years to come.
Remember I did 10+ HFT c++ interviews
--HFT vs non-finance
Risk is the deciding factor. 

For MLP, Tower, Jump etc, I foresee high risk of stigma/PIP etc, but luckily I have a "knee guard" that I am inexperienced in this field and much older.

For a non-finance shop like Zuhlke, I estimate workload is lower, calibre is lower. Also I have a bigger "knee guard".

I would still stay away from banks (including SCB) to safeguard my reputation

--notes on hibernate timing
get an offer by Sep, before end of season, so I can spend more time with grandparents and also save my 6Y. The more years I have remaining, the more "attractive" I am among h1 candidates

I think tech companies also have hiring seasons.

Luckily, my MS job is stable and stress-free, 
* with remote work flexibility
* with c++ contexx
... but I don't want to slow down my job search. I want to stay focused and motivated.
--propose to Jay
beware of information leak. Better send after getting some SG offers

Hi Jay,

Here's a new proposal
* I will take an unpaid sabbatical for about 20 months
starting Jul (or Aug..) 2019
* will rejoin CEM in spring 2021, on my own to set things up for the family. I will then bring my family over before my son turns 13 in Aug 2019.

Reason 1: to spend a few years with my aging parents. My last chance, as my dad is too old travel to the U.S.
Reason 2: More Chinese education for my kids, but my son needs to leave Singapore before turning 13 to avoid a heavy NationalService liability deposit
Reason : My h1b 6-year cap is limited. It's advantageous for me to save it by waiting for my green card outside U.S. I can "recapture" the 20 months spent outside the U.S.
Reason (minor): income and cost -- there's cost saving in living with family. Please note higher salary is not so important to me. As you know I have walked away from higher offers many times (Morgan Stanley, Pimco etc). I'm impressed with your flexibility, efficiency and trustworthiness so I plan to stay with your firm when I return.

Legal questions:
Q: My priority date will be unaffected since CEM won't revoke my i-140?

My decision is not finalized. If no good plan, then I can bring my family over in 2019 or 2020.

今天收到美国移民部 I-140 批准函， 我正式完成绿卡过程第二阶段。 再等上几年就可以拿绿卡了。 I-140 批准意味着我可以选择换雇主调高薪水， 也可考虑回新工作几年。

2021年8月大宝13岁前要离新赴美 （以避免 $75000 兵役押金）。 美国9月开学， 可以5-7月来， 暖和。

在纽约换雇主..据说不难。 我不急。

回新最早2019年8月， 最晚 12 月。 几个原因：

* 工作压力： 目前很舒服， 值得珍惜。 
* 收入： 回新可能高一些， 但在纽约换雇主也可提薪， 而不换工作。
* 开支： 回新可以省 每月 $2000 左右 包括女佣，房租，机票
* 家人团聚： 目前几个月飞一次感觉很不错。 难得老板允许我在新加坡上班。
* 找工作 11 月开始淡季， 因此最晚 2019年10月找到工作， 最多要求推迟2个月上班。 
* 如果 2019年10月没找到工作，就2020年初再试。 不理想 -- 浪费我仅有的 6 年自由。 幸好仅浪费几个月。
