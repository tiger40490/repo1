Related Q: Do Americans discriminate against Australians with strong accent?

I would say minimal. Basic criteria -- if you can 1) speak English enough to be understood and 2) write English enough to make your points, then Americans would accept your English.

In many big American cities, non-native speakers account for 15-30% of local population. Singaporeans are among the best non-native speakers. 

Similarly, do mainlanders discriminate against Hongkong or Malaysian Chinese on their oral/written Chinese? 

I would say the written form is rarely subject to ethnic discrimination.

== new: efficacy^effective
efficacy is a capacity, a capacity for producing a desired effect.

The word "Effectiveness" has browader usage scenarios. Many of them are bad for Efficacy.

Self-efficacy measures the level of self-belief in your own capacity to get something done (achieve a desired goal), regardless how effective it is achieved.

For a given "intervention", I feel its efficacy is related to its Reliabilty. "Is this intervention higly likely to have this minimum effect"? Efficacy means reliability is high, though effectiveness may be low.

-- eg: efficacy in producing an erection. 

I may struggle for a long time, but I can do it. It may last just long enough for penetration and ejaculation, but I can do it.

VED .. can reliably induce a basic level of erection good enough for penetration.

Kegels .. can it reliably improve erection, regardless how much improvement?

-- eg: savings habit for ffree after retirement
Most folks seem to give up. Some folks do have a realistic CBBR. When asked how important a savings habit is to them, many dismiss it as inadequate -- low efficacy.

I am one of those who believe this habit is guaranteed to help improvement retirement cashflow. Its effectiveness (how much difference it makes) is another question.

-- eg: Saurabh demonstrated efficacy in his tech designs. He got the job done, and it's usable, even though the solution is not great.
