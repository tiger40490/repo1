-- new: The native speakers sound more sophisticated.
eg: James Bond always sounds (sexy and) sophisticated, partly based on accent. Many male protagonists in American movies are like that.
eg: [[off the rail]] 
eg: the interviews on MLP intranet. The native speakers sound more sophisticated.

Actually, 1) insight 2) vocab are the foundations beneath 3) articulation and 4) accent when we meet a sophisticated speaker. I think cool confidence is a key ingredient. With cool confidence, one can really slow down. Articulation would improve.

Somehow, Singaporeans seldom have that sophistication, esp. in slow-n-steady articulation and accent. Some local professionals (such as secretaries or receptionists) learned a sophisticated accent, but they lack a sophiticated vocab.

To develop a sophisticated vocab, you first _need_ a rich oral vocab.

-- fuxi:
"consume twice the global average of wheat" meaning 
twice the global average of wheat consumption per_person.

There's no alternative meaning, but still the sentence sounds unclear.
