Hi  Franklin,

A few pointers to jot down and share, to prevent memory loss.

I feel excited to hear your family-making plans.

The start-up road is long and winding. I hope to share my personal experiences (my early 30s) and my moral support. I know the Singapore ecosystem slightly better than the China scene.

Save up because you are planning for a baby.
Save up because you are planning to buy an HDB flat.
Save up because you are going to fund your venture from your savings.
Save up because due to inflation, price levels are 10% higher than pre-Covid.

Next time we meet up I will pay for everything. I am not a generous man in the conventional sense, but I'm happy to buy something practically useful for my friends.

You are one of a handful of individuals I trust enough to transact with.
