Hi  Franklin,

A few pointers to jot down and share, to prevent memory loss.

I feel excited to hear your family-making plans.

The start-up road is long and winding. Next time, I hope to share my personal experiences (my early 30s) and my moral support. I know the Singapore ecosystem slightly better than the China scene.

Save up because you are planning for a baby.
Save up because you are planning to buy an HDB flat.
Save up because you are going to fund your venture from your savings.

Next time we meet up I will pay for everything. I am not a generous man in the conventional sense, but I'm happy to buy something practically useful for my friends.

You are one of a handful of individuals I trust enough to transact with.

I like your optimism and confidence. I need the same when dealing with my challenges.
