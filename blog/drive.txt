I want to review my driving blog, relive the experience, and gain more insight

The blog feels like a diary.

There were so many things to watch out for. There were so many dangers.

Because i had so much trouble learning the multiple challenges of driving, I wanted to practice in difficult situations such as NYC. I think it worked to some extent.

-- new: driving required such a slow leraning curve
During the prolonged learning process, I was so unsure about the challenges. (How about my son?)

I knew I was far slower than most learners. I needed a lot of time and money. I had a relaxed job, not like the stressful GS days.

The past learning / testing experience left deep scars. I labelled myself "learning difficulties". (How about my son?)
