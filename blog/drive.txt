--new: driving=more dangerous than it seems
driving is actually dangerous, even though the U.S. culture describes it as an everyday risk.

When a movie shows a traffic accident, we often dismiss it as a contrived plot device, similiar to a miscarriage due to an accidental fall. Actually, traffic accident are quite common. Joe Biden and John Edwards both lost family members in traffic accidents.

Look at motorcycling. It's a more than 10 times more dangerous than driving at least in terms of death rate, but most people seem to accept the risks inherent in motorcycling.

But No. Driving is a risk we Can avoid if we reduce driving esp. driving on highways, driving at night, driving in snow. I'm not saying reduce by 90%. Just reduce by 10%.

I want to review my driving blog, relive the experience, and gain more insight

The blog feels like a diary.

--new:
There were so many things to watch out for. There were so many dangers.

Because i had so much trouble learning the multiple challenges of driving, I wanted to practice in difficult situations such as NYC. I think it worked to some extent.Â 

--new: where did I make the most mistakes
I think my blog can help.

-- new: driving required such a slow leraning curve
During the prolonged learning process, I was so unsure about the challenges. (How about my son?)

I knew I was far slower than most learners. I needed a lot of time and money. I had a relaxed job, not like the stressful GS days.

The past learning / testing experience left deep scars. I labelled myself "learning difficulties". (How about my son?)
