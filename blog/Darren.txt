Hi Darren,

I have a habit of writing down my reflections after a financial planning discussion. I think it's workload for you to read and reply to this lengthy write-up, so I see no obligation for you to reply.

The basic and primary value-proposition of insurers like AXA is life insurance. The proposition is centered around the surviving dependents. For my dependents, if I pass away unexpectedly, even without insurance payouts they have "enough" financial support:
* my parents have more than enough pension income in Beijing for as long as they live. IFF I pass away before them (unlikely), their pension can help support my dependents.
* my elder sister is earning a comfortable salary in Australia. She has no dependents.
* my wife is a qualified and experineced pre-school teacher. 
* my employer has GroupTermLife worth some 300k. Aavailble IFF I pass away while employed.
* CPF DPS + death benefits from my various insurance plans

As to my wife's "life", the financial implication is small. 
As to my kids' life insurance, I think it is not useful to buy protection for their death at this stage. Only when my son has dependents, does it it make sense to worry about "How would those dependents cope with his passing?"
