LGlp: swim a bit

-- wife's banking choices
#1 PSBC _despite_ NRIC, using the #178 mobileNum
#2 CMB _but_ 1) long-term mobileNum is a problem 2) need another APP on my/her phone 3) fewer outlets
#3 ICBC [only if mobileNum hard] _but_ Rmb500/Y of additional ATM fees for one or two years. Tolerable amount to save a lot of stress + legwork. See buy stress-relief #ris`income

-- mobileNums
182 .. once removed, I can't give a new number to psbc :(. Better transfer to my name, but no hurry.
