-- new: Save time to do ...?
eg: Some people want faster intercourse. They want to save time for something else, but what's more enjoyable?

eg: I often regret spending too much with my son on the renzi trips. I wanted to save time for other things like study, work, recreational reading.. Many parents enjoy those parent-child bonding trips so they would save time for that.

In my younger years, I wanted less sleep

-- new: envy those 5H^9H sleepers
When I first came to SG, I was shocked that my HCJC classmates could make do with 6H sleep.
I envied them becasue I felt having more disposable hours enabled them to enjoy more, achieve more. I felt that my 2H extra sleep was like 2H wasted on commute or in prison.

Now in my late 40s I envy those who can sleep 9H. They get to enjoy more rest. The xpSelf enjoys the extra sleep.

Q: if you sleep 9H/day on adverage, is your life 10% shorter than your twin sister who sleeps 6H/day (assuming comparable lifespan).
Q: do you count only the disposable hours? I don't. Sleep hours can be a pleasure just like meditation, slow dining, sexual intimacy, or play time with kids

-- updating shifting ..
bmi on and off
5/wk on for a year
academic coaching (not parenting per se) off for years and now on
AMB on briefly 
pff off for a long time and now on. I feel should reduce.
tech xx is completely off now.

Clearly, my absorbency and mental energy is limited. I am less effective when I spread myself too thin. For AMB, I think chipaway is better, or take some time-off.

-- slow cooking update blogpost on more/less?
Fact: for some of us, we always feel insufficient allocation to this or that aspects of our lives. Ocassionally, we feel some over-allocation, too.

Our t-allocation decisions are dynamic, fluid and largely run by System1, therefore never precise and /impeccable/. 
I feel the need to constantly review our allocation decisions over short and long histories, and adjust.
I mean Allocation of time + System2 resources [attention, energy, absorbency...]

The higher ground I want to push toward is a situation where I find very few items constantly starved/underserved, and ideally the "starvation" is more evenly spread out to all areas.
On this higher ground, I would really remember a few (temporary) success stories of adjustment. The success stories empower me to endeavor to correct/adjust my allocation strategy, rather than the familiar powerless guilt driven by perfectionism.

in recent weeks, 
I have little to do on my job
I have decreased tech xx compared to years ago
I have :) reduced (or maintained) fren dialog t-spends
I have :) maintained workout t-spends
I have :) reined in tcost on pff
I have :) increased family time
I have increased the amount of rest including sleep
I have reduced library/movie trips
I have increased blogg (and other efforts) as self-care. As noted in the blogpost on I-statement, my type of blogging is not easy, not lazy, takes training and effort.

^^ Now I don't feel the burn [self-discipline, with materialistic gains]
My father, in his twilight years, would probably prefer quiet peaceful time,,, not burn.

Perhaps my current t-allocation is nearly /optimal/, based on the successE definition

-- ask grandpa
perhaps it would be more effective to develop some deep hobbies early in life, such as writing, playing music,,,
However, your mileage will vary, substantially.
