--more time with grandparents, in the last few weeks

--fuxi: current guilty t-spends:
* read about covid19
* too much chitchat with grandpa -- often makes me feel blessed but also generates zsms
* shopping trip with boy, even though I buy healthy foods and builds bonding with boy
* git-blogging on MRT -- smart and efficient, but now I hate myself for doing this everyday.
* update wordpress from git-blogging -- more efficient than previously, but still zsms!
* research about SG vs other countries -- quite strategic!

Overall, I feel like missing the two ingredients of "burn"
1) self-discipline
2) materialistic ROTI

Remember I wanted tell the 10-year old tanbin "no one is that strong. Everyone is weak and helpless and deserve punishment/ridicule for being weak." This zsms (and self-hate) is based on exorbitant expectations of self-discipline, martyrdom and self-mastery. The standard is based on an unrealistic concept of weaknesss vs strength. More often, the expectation is based on peer comparison and benchmarking.

The yardstick is relative (to peers) not absolute. By absolute standard, I have ffree and ought to enjoy my carefree life so I don't need to work hard on any front except wellness !

So after "pushing" myself with half the strength for a few months after Cambodia trip, I now notice the cumulative effect of the half-effort. Now I no longer allow myself to stay this "low". However, in fact, during this "low" period, 
* I did lots of CIV with friends
* I wrapped up both MIH and BGC investments
* I helped boy on math, and engaged YoungProdigy. I repaired the bonding with quality facetime more than once
* I did huge amount of jogging
* I was able to get up early on most days
* I continued my diet in terms of starch, raw veg, fruits, 

All of the above were somehow dismissed. In this perception, I ignore or discount those and other observable/realized gains in wellness, family bonding, ,,, due to the "burn" factors above.

--no blog: I'm tuned in to myself. I think the current driver is spare time utilization, or the zsms thereof.
Burn/rot is mostly materialistic pursuit + self-discipline ... martyrdom?

In the typical weekend, median hours spent on 'burn' is about 2 hour such as tech xx, localSys, workout or academic coaching
In the most 'burn' weekend, I can hit 10-20 hour, never 40 hours
This weekend I have achieved
* gate skirt -- lots of time, research, tweaking, and courage in the face of uncertainty.
* math coaching incl meimei
* friday jogging , chin-up
* diet control

To satisfy that driver (and that judge) I push myself to jogging or office

cognitive sms-therapy: 
I need to drive home the sms "the gate fixture has big impact on family wellbeing". No hurry and I don't want to hire a contractor just for it. 
I have spare time so this is a good use of my spare time.
I can derive a bit of joy

What's strategic -- 
localsys? No
stretch? Yes but no power surge in that space
coach my son on wordy problems? No 
coach my son on self-discipline and confidence? possibly

--jolt: comparing to my c++us days, my roti is now very poor 
.. but I managed to avoid the (unthinkably) dreadful situation of family separation during covid19
.. but why care about roti?
.. but those high roti levels may be short-lived and based on biased data collection

--jolt: compared to Bayonne days, I still have some non-trivial spare time.
I used to "burn" some of it on coding drill (2H/W), yoga(6H/W), workout etc

Now the 'burn' is (higher or lower) -- spent on parenting, (mini) workout, localSys

--fuxi: when overloaded with commitments in investment, parenting,,,

* mlp project
* help boy with math -- stressful, fearful of anxiety. Better postpone to when both of us are in better mood
* bgc title -- no real urgency. need to slow down
* tax filing and hrblock fee payment (from citibank)? no real hurry
* starhub bill -- can check later; will create stress

Go to office and work a bit but take leaves, to avoid stress/guilt and sleep deprivation -> immune system under strain

I should consider taking half-day leaves, and spend many hours blogging to bring back the much-needed clarity 

Many people spend office hours on those personal commitments. UnWise?

If busy with projects, those Projects might be affected (worst case -- overlooked). Even if you are skillful to avoid any impact, the juggling is likely to create stress.

If not busy at work, then I tend to feel guilty for taking advantage of employer
