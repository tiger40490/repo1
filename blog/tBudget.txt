--today Sunday I changed my plan (early to office) to spend more time with meimei (plauyground ...)
If I follow my original plan, I would probably feel an accumulation of guilt.

But now I feel the few hours spent at home somehow unproductive. Subsconsciously, I was benchmarking myself using "burn".


 

--update blogpost on burn
materialistic roti + absorbency

In a way, burn often focuses on the non-urgent-but-important quardrant, the tough jobs that deserve lots of sunshine.
-- no blog: per finance is possibly strategic but no absorbency required. therefore doesn't feel like burn
--no blog: plowback of extra free time is becoming quite important
Daily workout is gr8

But I don't want any pressure, any guilt.
Perhaps not ready to deal with this plowback question.

--no blog: 
ERE Jacob pointed out that many early retirees have too much free time and not enough meaningful projects to occupy the free time. "Free from financial worries, but free to do ...."

That's not how I feel in my carefree life now.

Q: carefree? why am i still so short of time? not really carefree?
* parenting -- requires a huge amount of time? "Require" is the wrong word. Parenting sucks up unlimited amount of time, but the time is often not very productive. 
* BGC -- lots of decisions
* gold, additional bx -- can provide more cushion 
* stocks --
* critical mass maintenance --
* body-buiding -- 

As revealed to my sis, there's still livelihood anxiety under the surface.

--no blog
if I focus my attention on XR's question about how I make use of my free time on the job, I would derive some awareness, some pain, but probably not a lot of motivatio to change.

If I have 4H/d freed up compared to past jobs, then 
1H spent on parenting
2H spent on blogging/emailing including investments such as overseas property
some hour spent on workout
some hour spent on DIY home improvement
less time spent on tech learning than before

my outing time with boy is still very very high, but better than P2 time when focus was on renzi. 2020 outing trips tend to be joint exercise.

In a way, I have no better usage of my increased spare time. The tech xx doesn't feel so satisfying. Blogging is the most satisfying, more than workout.

In Bayonne, I would spend it on workout, blogging, tech xx

--fuxi
blogging for time usage and blogging about blogging should NOT be cut.

--fuxi
when would I have time for 
* general nlg colorful, highly readable books about our body, transportation
* reduce the git-blog files

--fuxi: weekend roti target is important in my recent experience. 
Q: Is it possible that on some weekends I don't notice the low roti? 
A: Unlikely. The poor roti would inevitably become obvious and irratating, similar to money wasted.

In contrast, my weekday roti can also become very low but i do put in more effort... never as indulgent and lazy as on weekends

--new untitled
what's in common between:
* comparison-shopping for tiny savings
* curiosity google searches
* lots of time spent on FSM, robinhood with small trades

All of these are pleasurable. All entail huge cumulative tcost

--new jolt: family outing: extremely low roti,high tcost
The Cigna counsellors advocate family outing for stress relief and family bonding. I agree, but I don't think it is the most efficient. It is legitimate pleasure for sure. (Can we reduce it to once in two weeks? Just give some excuse like weather, appointments...)

In a way, people (average or high intelligence) save money exactly for pleasures such as family outing. I guess it's important to be aware of the tcost, although the awareness can create stress, guilt... 

Analogy -- I think before we enjoy a fancy meal, we need at least some awareness of the high $cost and BMI cost. Life is mostly about pain, duty, effort, livelihood,,, and much less about pleasure (享受).

My Safari experience is somewhat better. Food was a controlled indulgence. .. If I always say NO then family bonding may suffer.  Family bonding might be more important than career, investment, asset mgmt etc
--new: t-allocation: no need2earn more..
t_stress
See also stress-light days

some high flyers live under stress (including my style of constant study). 
Other high fliers (My sister? Rahul?) work hard and play harder.. usually big spenders. 

Nowadays I often feel I don't need to earn more so I want to increase the amount of (personal or family) time in peaceful leisure.

How about leisure reading? Pleasure but /decadent/indulgent/. 
How about social gathering, networking events? Not so enjoyable, and very time-consuming.
exercise, QQ, reflective blogging ... are much better.

--fuxi: spare time: now^c++US
jolt: compared to c++US days, I still have some non-trivial spare time.
I used to "burn" some of it on coding drill (2H/W), yoga(6H/W), workout etc

Now the 'burn' is (higher or lower) -- spent on parenting, household chores, (mini) workout, localSys, 

Managing the various enrichment programs -- is partly parenting, partly household duty

gadget management -- about 3 hours a week.

family outing -- is huge tcost. The time I could utilize for blogging or learning is very little. There's also the wrong-time temptation.

No wonder I have so little time left for tech xx. This analysis is valuable as it addresses the guilt, self-hate, sense of stagnation, lack of progress.

--fuxi: current guilty t-spends:
* read about covid19
* too much chitchat with grandpa -- often makes me feel blessed but also generates zsms
* shopping trip with boy, even though I buy healthy foods and builds bonding with boy
* git-blogging on MRT -- smart and efficient, but now I hate myself for doing this everyday.
* update wordpress from git-blogging -- more efficient than previously, but still zsms!
* research about SG vs other countries -- quite strategic!

Overall, I feel like missing the two ingredients of "burn"
1) self-discipline
2) materialistic ROTI

Remember I wanted tell the 10-year old tanbin "no one is that strong. Everyone is weak and helpless and deserve punishment/ridicule for being weak." This zsms (and self-hate) is based on exorbitant expectations of self-discipline, martyrdom and self-mastery. The standard is based on an unrealistic concept of weaknesss vs strength. More often, the expectation is based on peer comparison and benchmarking.

The yardstick is relative (to peers) not absolute. By absolute standard, I have ffree and ought to enjoy my carefree life so I don't need to work hard on any front except wellness !

So after "pushing" myself with half the strength for a few months after Cambodia trip, I now notice the cumulative effect of the half-effort. Now I no longer allow myself to stay this "low". However, in fact, during this "low" period, 
* I did lots of CIV with friends
* I wrapped up both MIH and BGC investments
* I helped boy on math, and engaged YoungProdigy. I repaired the bonding with quality facetime more than once
* I did huge amount of jogging
* I was able to get up early on most days
* I continued my diet in terms of starch, raw veg, fruits, 

All of the above were somehow dismissed. In this perception, I ignore or discount those and other observable/realized gains in wellness, family bonding, ,,, due to the "burn" factors above.

--no blog: I'm tuned in to myself. I think the current driver is spare time utilization, or the zsms thereof.
Burn/rot is mostly materialistic pursuit + self-discipline ... martyrdom?

In the typical weekend, median hours spent on 'burn' is about 2 hour such as tech xx, localSys, workout or academic coaching
In the most 'burn' weekend, I can hit 10-20 hour, never 40 hours
This weekend I have achieved
* gate skirt -- lots of time, research, tweaking, and courage in the face of uncertainty.
* math coaching incl meimei
* friday jogging , chin-up
* diet control

To satisfy that driver (and that judge) I push myself to jogging or office

cognitive sms-therapy: 
I need to drive home the sms "the gate fixture has big impact on family wellbeing". No hurry and I don't want to hire a contractor just for it. 
I have spare time so this is a good use of my spare time.
I can derive a bit of joy

What's strategic -- 
localsys? No
stretch? Yes but no power surge in that space
coach my son on wordy problems? No 
coach my son on self-discipline and confidence? possibly

--fuxi: when overloaded with commitments in investment, parenting,,,

* mlp project
* help boy with math -- stressful, fearful of anxiety. Better postpone to when both of us are in better mood
* bgc title -- no real urgency. need to slow down
* tax filing and hrblock fee payment (from citibank)? no real hurry
* starhub bill -- can check later; will create stress

Go to office and work a bit but take leaves, to avoid stress/guilt and sleep deprivation -> immune system under strain

I should consider taking half-day leaves, and spend many hours blogging to bring back the much-needed clarity 

Many people spend office hours on those personal commitments. UnWise?

If busy with projects, those Projects might be affected (worst case -- overlooked). Even if you are skillful to avoid any impact, the juggling is likely to create stress.

If not busy at work, then I tend to feel guilty for taking advantage of employer
