textbook on calculus is too heavy and not worth carrying. 
Perhaps I can read a bit to build up my high-level knowledge for influence on my son.
This kinda reading is really recreational, similar to piano, AMB, MOETF, but often outcompeted by the big energy sinks

my epa projects need to be time-bound. I could give Steve or ... a timeline about some milestones.
The timeline would create some healthy stress.
Without it, the project could drag on and on.

Similarly, the BGC bill check needs some timeline, otherwise, the self-hate would grow on and on.

long-term leverage usually higher in ICU and II, such as math coaching for both kids.

Fact: for some of us, we always feel insufficient allocation to this or that aspects of our lives. Ocassionally, we feel some over-allocation, too.

Our t-allocation decisions are dynamic, fluid and largely run by System1, therefore never precise and /impeccable/. 
I feel the need to constantly review our allocation decisions over short and long histories, and adjust.
I mean Allocation of time + System2 resources [attention, energy, absorbency...]

The higher ground I want to push toward is a situation where I find very few items constantly starved/underserved, and ideally the "starvation" is more evenly spread out to all areas.
On this higher ground, I would really remember a few (temporary) success stories of adjustment. The success stories empower me to endeavor to correct/adjust my allocation strategy, rather than the familiar powerless guilt driven by perfectionism.

in recent weeks, 
I have decreased tech xx compared to years ago (partly due to dimishing return), replaced with practical scripting, automation,,,, 
I have :) reduced (or maintained) fren dialog t-spends
I have :) maintained workout t-spends
I have :) reined in tcost on pff
I have :) increased family time, esp. with boy and meimei
I have experienced inreasing demand (on my Sys2 resources) from BGC, Cambodia, US tax, 
I have slowly reduced Diyhi allocation
I have reduced library/movie trips
I have increased blogg (and other efforts) as self-care. As noted in the blogpost on I-statement, my type of blogging is not easy, not lazy, takes training and effort.

^^ Now I don't feel the burn [self-discipline, with materialistic gains]
My father, in his twilight years, would probably prefer quiet peaceful time,,, not burn.

Perhaps my current t-allocation is nearly /optimal/, based on the successE definition

perhaps it would be more effective to develop some deep hobbies early in life, such as writing, playing music,,,

-- fuxi: 13 Nov family outing trip was very low productivity, "rot". 
Somehow I avoided the burn-rot trap of self-hate. 
I used to be a hostage. The high standad of productivity was simply unrealistic with family outing. 

In contrast, I think a corporate team-building event could be (would be) benchmarked for efficiency, but that's for the organizer. 
Most participants would be too relaxed and fail the benchmark. 

Family members are more like the participants rather than the organizers.

-- fuxi or updating shifting ..
bmi on and off
5/wk on for a year
academic coaching (not parenting per se) off for years and now on
pff off for a long time and now on. I feel should reduce.
tech xx is completely off now.

Clearly, my absorbency and mental energy is limited. I am less effective when I spread myself too thin. For AMB, I think chipaway is better, or take some time-off.
