-- slow cooking update blogpost on more/less?
Fact: for some of us, we always feel insufficient allocation to this or that aspects of our lives. Ocassionally, we feel some over-allocation, too.

Our t-allocation decisions are dynamic, fluid and largely run by System1, therefore never precise and /impeccable/. 
I feel the need to constantly review my allocation decisions over short and long histories, and adjust.
I mean Allocation of time + System2 resources [attention, energy, absorbency...]

The higher ground I want to push toward is a situation where I find very few items constantly starved/underserved, and ideally the "starvation" is more evenly spread out to all areas.
On this higher ground, I would really remember a few (temporary) success stories of adjustment. The success stories empower me to endeavor to correct/adjust my allocation strategy, rather than the familiar powerless guilt driven by perfectionism.

in recent weeks, 
I have decreased tech xx (including deep_work) compared to years ago (partly due to dimishing return), replaced with practical scripting, automation,,,, 
I have :) reduced (or maintained) fren dialog t-spends
I have :) maintained workout t-spends
I have :) reined in tcost on pff
I have :) increased family time, esp. with boy and meimei
I have experienced inreasing demand (on my Sys2 resources) from BGC, Cambodia, US tax, 
I have slowly reduced Diyhi allocation
I have reduced library/movie trips
I have increased blogg (and other efforts) as self-care. As noted in the blogpost on I-statement, my type of blogging is not easy, not lazy, takes training and effort.

^^ Now I don't feel the burn [self-discipline, with materialistic gains]
My father, in his twilight years, would probably prefer quiet peaceful time,,, not burn.

Perhaps my current t-allocation is nearly /optimal/, based on the successE definition

perhaps it would be more effective to develop some Deep hobbies early in life, such as writing, playing pop songs ,,,

textbook on calculus is too heavy and not worth carrying. 

This kinda reading is really recreational, similar to piano, AMB, MOETF, but often outcompeted by the big energy sinks
