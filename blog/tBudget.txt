-- new: Save time to do what?
eg: Some people want faster intercourse. They want to save time for something else, but what can be more enjoyable?

eg: I often regret spending too much with my son on the renzi trips. I wanted to save time for other things like study, work, recreational reading.. Many parents enjoy those parent-child bonding trips so they would save time for that.

eg: on a vacation, we get up early and move fast, saving time to see more places, but I told my wife we sacrifice sleep and leisure. We saved time to get ourself tired and overstimulated. 

I think the xpSelf would want to slow down and enjoy the good times, but the rmSelf would want to hurry up, move quickly and "achieve" more.

eg: The ERE author questioned after achieving freeom from financial constraints, we are "free to do ...?"

-- updating shifting ..
bmi on and off
5/wk on for a year
academic coaching (not parenting per se) off for years and now on
AMB on briefly 
pff off for a long time and now on. I feel should reduce.
tech xx is completely off now.

Clearly, my absorbency and mental energy is limited. I am less effective when I spread myself too thin. For AMB, I think chipaway is better, or take some time-off.

-- slow cooking update blogpost on more/less?
Fact: for some of us, we always feel insufficient allocation to this or that aspects of our lives. Ocassionally, we feel some over-allocation, too.

Our t-allocation decisions are dynamic, fluid and largely run by System1, therefore never precise and /impeccable/. 
I feel the need to constantly review our allocation decisions over short and long histories, and adjust.
I mean Allocation of time + System2 resources [attention, energy, absorbency...]

The higher ground I want to push toward is a situation where I find very few items constantly starved/underserved, and ideally the "starvation" is more evenly spread out to all areas.
On this higher ground, I would really remember a few (temporary) success stories of adjustment. The success stories empower me to endeavor to correct/adjust my allocation strategy, rather than the familiar powerless guilt driven by perfectionism.

in recent weeks, 
I have little to do on my job
I have decreased tech xx compared to years ago
I have :) reduced (or maintained) fren dialog t-spends
I have :) maintained workout t-spends
I have :) reined in tcost on pff
I have :) increased family time
I have increased the amount of rest including sleep
I have reduced library/movie trips
I have increased blogg (and other efforts) as self-care. As noted in the blogpost on I-statement, my type of blogging is not easy, not lazy, takes training and effort.

^^ Now I don't feel the burn [self-discipline, with materialistic gains]
My father, in his twilight years, would probably prefer quiet peaceful time,,, not burn.

Perhaps my current t-allocation is nearly /optimal/, based on the successE definition

-- ask grandpa
perhaps it would be more effective to develop some deep hobbies early in life, such as writing, playing music,,,
However, your mileage will vary, substantially.
