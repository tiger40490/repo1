how do I feel about coding drill + tech xx during my PEK trips?
en-route, I no longer feel the mtv

In Beijing, I have too many commitments .. banks; spend time with gm; workout; blogg (often required for self-mgmt);;; 
I feel these commitments are no less important than techxx. 
I lost the mtv but I also "lost" the decade-old zsms :)

the tech books I brought to DJDJ, I had not found mtv (or time). However, I did read some old tech books en-route

-- update which bpost on quietime... perhaps the restaurant

cinema before a movie
fastFood with table + free wifi, 
library
stadium 
MRT, bus interchange, with A/C
downstairs, 
office on weekends/evenings

I am using a few t-allocation "fraeworks" to manage multiple on-going projects in my life.
Q: am I missing anything important?
A: No. I rely on my surveilance/escalation "system" whenever I notice some item is (neglected) not getting enough sunshine(attention)

At the moment, my spare time goes to these energy sinks -- all worthwhile:
pff
work projects
academic parenting
wellness

-- slow cooking update blogpost on more/less?
Fact: for some of us, we always feel insufficient allocation to this or that aspects of our lives. (To be fair, occasionally we feel some over-allocation.)

Our t-allocation decisions are dynamic, fluid and largely run by System1, therefore never precise and /impeccable/. 
I feel the need to constantly review my allocation decisions over short and long horizons, and adjust.
I mean Allocation of time + System2 resources [attention, energy, absorbency...]

The higher ground I want to push toward is a situation where I find very few items constantly starved (insufficient sunshine), and ideally the short-term "starvation" is evenly spread out across.
On this higher ground, I would really remember a few (temporary) success stories of adjustment. The success stories empower me to endeavor to correct/adjust/fine-tune my allocation strategy, and avoid the familiar "powerless guilt" driven by the /tyrany/ of perfectionism.

In recent months, 
I have decreased tech xx including deep_work, compared to years ago (partly due to dimishing return), replaced with practical scripting, excel, automation, localSys,,, 
I have :) reduced fren dialog t-spends and created temporary starvation
I have :) increased family time, esp. with boy and with meimei
I have experienced inreasing demand (on my Sys2 resources) from BGC, Cambodia, US stocks, USD TD,,,
I have increased blogg (and other efforts) as /self-care/. As noted in the blogpost on I-statement, my type of blogg is not easy, not lazy, takes training and effort.
^^ Now I don't feel the burn [self-discipline, with materialistic gains]
My father, in his twilight years, would probably prefer quiet peaceful time,,, not burn.

Perhaps my current t-allocation is nearly /optimal/, based on the successE/successZ definition.
