-- new blogg vs writing4publication
In my 30's, I would look down on my friends (like Chonglei.Qi) who had unique personal views on many topics. I often say "commit to writing down your views and get them published." That would lead to meaningful discussions and create more "value-add" (noun?).

For some years, I also had a negative view on private diary (in contrast to public blog). I would say it's important to review the content with other people.

Over the decades since, I have realized that 1) a reputable (serious) publication, or 2) a real review with a friend all entail huge amounts of time and energy. Therefore, personal diary + some email discussion is the only reasonable compromise I can have. 

Note all of these activities can (and did) take up sooo much spare time, that they often become the primary energy-sink of the year

-- updating shifting ..
bmi on and off
5/wk on for a year
academic coaching (not parenting per se) off for years and now on
AMB on briefly 
pff off for a long time and now on. I feel should reduce.
tech xx is completely off now.

Clearly, my absorbency and mental energy is limited. I am less effective when I spread myself too thin. I think chipaway is better for AMB, or take some time-off.

-- slow cooking update blogpost on more/less?
Fact: for some of us, we always feel insufficient allocation to this or that aspects of our lives. Ocassionally, we feel some over-allocation, too.

Our t-allocation decisions are dynamic, fluid and largely run by System1, therefore never precise and /impeccable/. 
I feel the need to constantly review our allocation decisions over short and long histories, and adjust.
I mean Allocation of time + System2 resources [attention, energy, absorbency...]

The higher ground I want to push toward is a situation where I find very few items constantly starved/underserved, and ideally the "starvation" is more evenly spread out to all areas.
On this higher ground, I would really remember a few (temporary) success stories of adjustment. The success stories empower me to endeavor to correct/adjust my allocation strategy, rather than the familiar powerless guilt driven by perfectionism.

in recent weeks, 
I have little to do on my job
I have decreased tech xx compared to years ago
I have :) reduced (or maintained) fren dialog t-spends
I have :) maintained workout t-spends
I have :) reined in tcost on pff
I have :) increased family time
I have increased the amount of rest including sleep
I have reduced library/movie trips
I have increased blogg (and other efforts) as self-care. As noted in the blogpost on I-statement, my type of blogging is not easy, not lazy, takes training and effort.

^^ Now I don't feel the burn [self-discipline, with materialistic gains]
My father, in his twilight years, would probably prefer quiet peaceful time,,, not burn.

Perhaps my current t-allocation is nearly /optimal/, based on the successE definition

-- ask grandpa
perhaps it would be more effective to develop some deep hobbies early in life, such as writing, playing music,,,
However, your mileage will vary, substantially.

-- fuxi: if I continue to negelect workout, coding drill, QQ,,, for too long, __zsms__ would likely grow (dissatisfaction blackholes)
even though I put in more hours into my projects
even though I spend more time with grandparents
even though I spend more time with kids

I feel these t-spends are more important but doesn't meet my "burn" standard -- roti + self-discipline

weekend roti is a counter-productive concept esp. in terms of family time and babysitting boy -- high tcost low visible ROTI.
