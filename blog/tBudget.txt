--jolt: compared to Bayonne days, I still have some non-trivial spare time.
I used to "burn" some of it on coding drill (2H/W), yoga(6H/W), workout etc

Now the 'burn' is (higher or lower) -- spent on parenting, (mini) workout, localSys

--fuxi: when overloaded with commitments in investment, parenting,,,
top priority is rest and immune system

* 48 hours black rock -- not a real stressor for me per se
* help boy with math -- stressful, fearful, 
* Flatiron payment. I think they can wait for a few days. I can send a small amount ($6600) from maybank first
* mlp project - can wait
* bgc title -- no real urgency. need to slow down
* tax filing and hrblock fee payment (from citibank)? no real hurry

Go to office and work a bit but take leaves, to avoid stress/guilt and sleep deprivation -> immune system under strain

I should consider taking half-day leaves, and spend many hours blogging to bring back the much-needed clarity 

Many people spend office hours on those personal commitments. UnWise?

If busy with projects, those Projects might be affected (worst case -- overlooked). Even if you are skillful to avoid any impact, the juggling is likely to create stress.

If not busy at work, then I tend to feel guilty for taking advantage of employer
