--jolt: compared to Bayonne days, I still have some non-trivial spare time.
I used to "burn" some of it on coding drill (2H/W), yoga(6H/W), workout etc

Now the 'burn' is (higher or lower) -- spent on parenting, (mini) workout, localSys

--fuxi: when overloaded with commitments in investment, parenting,,,
* help boy with math
* meimei dental? Leave it to wife
* Flatiron payment. I think they can wait for a few days
* hrblock fee payment? no real hurry
* Jay Hu form? Relatively simple so let's wrap it up.
* take some leaves if needed, to avoid stress/guilt and sleep deprivation

I should consider taking half-day leaves, and spend many hours blogging to bring back the much-needed clarity 

Many people spend office hours on those personal commitments. UnWise?

If busy with projects, those Projects might be affected (worst case -- overlooked). Even if you are skillful to avoid any impact, the juggling is likely to create stress.

If not busy at work, then I tend to feel guilty for taking advantage of employer

--new: weekend family outing: aim at burn
exercise is burn ... hard burn
math practice and my coding drill is burn
tech xx is also burn, but less tough.

watch out my personal tcost. I could allocate it to 
* mlp prj + related self-xx
* coding drill
* c++/java QQ
