--no blog: I'm tuned in to myself. I think the current driver is spare time utilization, or the zsms thereof.
Burn/rot is mostly materialistic pursuit + self-discipline ... martyrdom?

In the typical weekend, median hours spent on 'burn' is about 2 hour such as tech xx, localSys, workout or academic coaching
In the most 'burn' weekend, I can hit 10-20 hour, never 40 hours
This weekend I have achieved
* gate skirt -- lots of time, research, tweaking, and courage in the face of uncertainty.
* math coaching incl meimei
* friday jogging , chin-up
* diet control

To satisfy that driver (and that judge) I push myself to jogging or office

cognitive sms-therapy: 
I need to drive home the sms "the gate fixture has big impact on family wellbeing". No hurry and I don't want to hire a contractor just for it. 
I have spare time so this is a good use of my spare time.
I can derive a bit of joy

What's strategic -- 
localsys? No
stretch? Yes but no power surge in that space
coach my son on wordy problems? No 
coach my son on self-discipline and confidence? possibly

--jolt: compared to Bayonne days, I still have some non-trivial spare time.
I used to "burn" some of it on coding drill (2H/W), yoga(6H/W), workout etc

Now the 'burn' is (higher or lower) -- spent on parenting, (mini) workout, localSys

--fuxi: when overloaded with commitments in investment, parenting,,,

* mlp project
* help boy with math -- stressful, fearful of anxiety. Better postpone to when both of us are in better mood
* bgc title -- no real urgency. need to slow down
* tax filing and hrblock fee payment (from citibank)? no real hurry
* starhub bill -- can check later; will create stress

Go to office and work a bit but take leaves, to avoid stress/guilt and sleep deprivation -> immune system under strain

I should consider taking half-day leaves, and spend many hours blogging to bring back the much-needed clarity 

Many people spend office hours on those personal commitments. UnWise?

If busy with projects, those Projects might be affected (worst case -- overlooked). Even if you are skillful to avoid any impact, the juggling is likely to create stress.

If not busy at work, then I tend to feel guilty for taking advantage of employer
