--when overloaded with commitments in investment, parenting,,,
I should consider taking half-day leaves.

Many people spend office hours on those personal commitments. UnWise?

If busy with projects, those Projects might be affected (worst being overlooking). Even if you are skiillful to avoid any impact, the juggling is likely to create stress.

If not busy at work, then I tend to feel guilty for taking advantage of employer

--fuxi:t-spend on laptop buy?
:) thinking/analysis was done in office, much better than on the go
:) I brought reading material to simlim
the 3-4 hours spent in simlim was kind of sight-seeing enjoyment. I learned that u.s. price is still lower but not a lot

--on mrt, git-blogging is more productive than smemo or blog printout

similary, blogging on keyboard is 5 times faster than audio/video blogging or pencil blogging
--new: t-efficiency at parenting
reading books -- efficient
blogging -- efficient
preparing worksheet -- efficient
outing -- extremely high t-cost
face time -- high t-cost and losing my cool

--fuxi:
My books on self-improvement, finance/economics knowledge, …. are not bearing fruits. Am not an intellectual as I was in my 20’s.
