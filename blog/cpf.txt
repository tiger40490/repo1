$10k self cash top-up .. excluded from green portion of cpfRA
$10k within-family cash top-up .. ditto. This includes my annual 8k.
$10k within-family cpf transfer .. ditto

VCon .. 3-way split .. the contribution to cpfSA will go into green portion
$10k self transfer from her own OA (including any VCon).. will go into green portion

As explained in xxx, the green portion is a portion of her cpfRA. This portion is f4w by "pledging". 

It's crucial to build up a big SA balance before 55, so that when cpfRA is created, it will have a sizeable green portion.
