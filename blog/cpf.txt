-- update which bposts on max out cpfLife (P1?)
payout will start at 65. I wish to receive higher payout, to strengthen livelihood security. That requires me to top up to ERS at 55, 65 or sometime in between.

If I hit ERS at 55, then liquidity suffers! I lose some 250k liquidity for 10Y! I may need that money for kids' education, a new home etc...

Q: can both of us hit ERS? Unlikely because it would require SGD 1000k cash.
Q: so who has priority to hit ERS? Me since my payout starts early, but she would feel more secure if payout is under her name.

A higher priority is .. hitting FRS when wife turns 55.

Suppose I cash top-up to wife's SA before her 55th birthday. (Total 200k). Her combined OA+SA hits FRS watermark. Then the FRS amount goes into RA. 

Any residual OA (salary contribution or interest) is immediately withdrawable. Like a bank account. No restriction like 'SA top-up amount is not withdrawable'.

If wife has no  plan to work in 2025, then consider VCon
