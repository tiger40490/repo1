-- update which bposts on max out cpfLife (P1?)
payout will start at 65. I wish to receive higher payout, to strengthen livelihood security. That requires me to top up to ERS at 55, 65 or sometime in between.

If I hit ERS at 55, then liquidity suffers! I lose some 250k liquidity for 10Y! I may need that money for kids' education, a new home etc...

Q: can both of us hit ERS? Unlikely because it would require SGD 1000k cash.
Q: so who has priority to hit ERS? Me since my payout starts early, but she would feel more secure if payout is under her name.

If wife has no  plan to work in 2025, then consider VCon
