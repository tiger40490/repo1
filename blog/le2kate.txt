Hi Kate,

After witnessing your home visit, I now regard you as the primary support for my family. You are the only one who had multiple in-depth conversations with each family member (3 of us).

When I describe Yixin or Mom (their words, actions, reactions) to other investigators, it's hard to be factual, impartial and complete. It's hard to avoid misleading representations. The listeners never have confidence that they have the full picture.

For example, I told many invesigators that Yixin only spoke to FSC social worker for 10 minutes each time and unwilling to open up to her, because he preferred male counsellors only. Today he opened up to you.

Mom vs Dad - who is nicer? I was startled when Yixin said that nowadays he is closer to Mom than Dad. It implied that, as expected, Dad was once nicer than Mom. What has made Dad more aliented than Mom? I guess "police" is one reason. He may or may not sense the indigation and determination in me -- Yixin's use of physical force against fale family members must stop, including his punching, unwelcome hugging, door pounding, door blocking, music affecting meimei's sleep, phone snatching. Neglected and dismissed by everyone is the risk of accidental injury. 

Angry yelling .. I have never paid attention to my reaction to Yixin's yelling. (Physical aggression has been my focus.) I guess Yixin's yelling is better than his (often without anger) aggressive actions. Better in terms of safety, in terms of intimidation. Yelling doesn't require crisis management. As an anger-management choice, yelling is a middle ground between physical-action and suppressed anger. Maybe I will guide Yixin in yelling?

midnight music .. I will focus on Mom/meimei. If they can sleep, then I will consider the volume acceptable. I will plead with my son to be considerate of his father.
