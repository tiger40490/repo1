Hi Kate,

After witnessing your home visit, I now regard you and your team as a key, if not the primary, support for my family. You are the only one who had multiple in-depth conversations with each family member.

When I describe Yixin or Mom in terms of their words, actions, reactions... to other investigators, they hear only me. It's hard for me to be factual, impartial and complete every time. It's hard to avoid misleading representations. The listeners can't talk to Yixin, and never have confidence that they have the full picture of my family.

For example, I told many invesigators "Yixin only spoke to FSC social worker for 10 minutes each time and unwilling to open up to her, because Yixin preferred male counsellors." On Friday, I saw that he opened up to you.

I didn't overhear everything between Yixin and you, but I had the impression that Yixin was cooperative and polite to you, showing sensibility, willingness to listen, and patience to explain himself in details. It begged the question "Why is he so nasty to parents?" 

Mom vs Dad - who is nicer? I was startled when Yixin said that nowadays he was closer to Mom than Dad. It implied that, as expected, Dad was ONCE nicer than Mom. What has alienated Dad more than Mom? I guess "police" is one reason. (Another might be my style of harsh, painful, repeated criticsm.) Yixin may or may not sense the indignation and determination in me -- Yixin's use of physical force against female family members must stop, including his punching, unwelcome hugging, door pounding, door blocking, late-night loud music, phone snatching..... Neglected and dismissed by everyone is the risk of accidental injury. 
I called in police to stop these physical conflicts and physical risks. If I'm not nice, so be it.

Angry yelling .. I have never paid attention to my reaction to Yixin's yelling. Physical aggression has been my focus. I guess Yixin's angry yelling is better than his aggressive actions, often without anger. I said "better" as it is better in terms of safety and in terms of intimidation. Yelling doesn't require crisis management. As an anger-management choice, yelling is a middle ground between physical-action and suppressed anger. I often engage in angry yelling.

midnight music .. I will focus on Mom/meimei. If they can sleep, then I will consider the music volume acceptable. I will plead with my son to be considerate of his father, and leave the decision to himself. In our Tokyo stay, he shared a small room with me and he did minimize music volume for me.

Multiple investigators asked me what changed in Oct/Nov that led to the escalation of conflicts.
Answer 1: nothing changed that led to Yixin's mistreatment of Mom. Same behavior for a long time. Tension boiled over only because I started calling police. I dared not do so when Yixin was cramming for O-levels. (He would be affected by police, or he could retaliate and threaten to skip an exam.)

Answer 2: The exam cram also emboldened him to stand firm against bathing and against early sleep, as if it would affect his mood for study. Yixin seemed to know exactly what he needs to do and what he must not do, in order to maximize cramming. His erratic study/sleep schedule also made him uninterested in family meals or unsweetened water. By the end of O-levels, parents have developed a strong perception of a stone-cold, irritable/ill-tempered, self-centered, self-isolated, self-sabotaging, deaf and stubborn teenager.

Answer 3: Yixing's existing anti-social behavior intensified during the O-levels. For example, he insisted on loud music as "I absolutely need it tonight, to study for tomorrow's exam."

Answer 4: exam cram disrrupted our family bonding times. We used to have weekly family times -- cycling, beach fun, dining out, movie night, game night. (I used to have regular chats with Yixin after midnight.) I get the sense (without evidence) that this "wheel" ground to a halt sometime in August 2024. After O-levels, the wheel is tentatively restarting. We had a bit of family outing within Singapore, but Yixin appeared determined to have it "my way, or no way". It became more vocal during Tokyo family trip.

Yixin would arrive at airport an hour later than the family .. deliberately late. Once, he insisted on taking subway by himself while the rest shared a taxi to airport. More than once he arrived right before gate closing, after all other passengers. 

Similar behavior at remote train stations... He refused to travel with family, and decided to arrive at train stations by himself close to departure time. (Next departure was hours away.)

Most annoying -- at xxxxxxxxxx family was in a hurry to catch a 4pm train. Yixin bluntly refused to finish his icecream (disallowed on train) in time, and deliberately missed that 4pm train. (I was trembling with anger.) I took the 4pm train by myself to avoid physical fight over his icecream. Mom decided to wait for Yixin to finish icecream, and board a later train, even though she worried about missing the connecting train.

Note this is our first Japan trip. No one understands Japanese. Yixin carried limited cash and no credit cards. His phone was often low-battery. He knew parents were worried every time. He seems to shrug it off like "I know what I'm doing. I can come home by myself" eve in the cold weather. 

In these stories, he was repeatedly reminded, but rejected, the common practice of "buffer" and margin of safety. It reminds me of teenage drivers speeding at the legal limit on an empty highway, without seat belt, eating lunch while watching live sports. 

Whenever family was looking for a dinner place, Yixin would take 20 to 40 minutes searching. He would dismiss dozens of restaurants. Frequently, other family members would tell him "hungry" and "Make up your mind in 10 minuets" but he would act deaf. Half the time, I gave up after following him over 10 minutes, and returned to hotel by myself, in protest or in disgust.

Tokyo subway trains have last train timing around midnight. Yixin would frequently aim at those, knowing the risk of missing the last train. This risk was worse when night temperature dropped towards zero, and Yixin's sister and mother had no choice but follow him around (because they can't navigate Tokyo subway). Most of the time, they were unable to persuade Yixin to return before midnight. I suspect that if Mom had insisted, then Yixin would have sent them home (i.e. to hotel) earlier -- not exactly "my way or no way". Once, he did send them home earlier.
