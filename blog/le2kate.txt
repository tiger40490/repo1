Hi Kate,

Psychiatric diagnosis .. no objection, no urgency. Now that Yixin has stablized in his anti-social behaviors, I feel we can wait-n-see.

Example: 21 Feb night Yixin came home after 1 am (22 Feb), and started making noises by slamming the metal gate and leaping all over the living room (his favorite home exercise). This lasted some unknown amount of time (I was half-conscious) until I got up, opened my bedroom door and complained about the recurring noise. Yixin questioned me "Am I jumping now?" I said I didn't remember when he last made the leaping noise but I needed it stopped. He said absolutely nothing and stopped his exercise.

Example: on 22 Feb, Zofia reported that Yixin kept her waiting for 30 minutes+ at some restaurant.

Labelling .. a real risk. If we receive a psychiatric diagnosis, this label can leave a permanent mark, like a scar on the self-image. So I don't want my son to get a specific diagnosis. The unconfirmed ODD diagnosis is enough for now. Thanks to your suggestion, we didn't use private ambulance to send him to IMH by force.

Calling police .. I accept Yixin's proposal "Dad can call police if both parents agree." Unless I can persuade Zofia, I will leave the scene and let Zofia deal with Yixin. 

Shower/tooth-brushing..  none observed. He is unwilling, presumably becaue there is no enforcement. Shall we take away his phone as consequence? I don't prefer, because the agreement was between him and someone else (Karan). 

In Shanghai, he took showers becuase the host (including his good friend) ask him and they have relationship power over him during that short period of time. No one else has such relationship power to change his self-harming behaviors, including teachers, counsellors and NS officers. 

Your role .. I think you can help Mom and Elaina. (I don't want to overload you with my own parenting problems.) I feel Elaina may prefer a female professional. I think Zofia trust you more than she trusts other professionals. Mom still suffers numerous emotional pains including disgust, despair, powerless/helpless/hopeless struggle. 

During the last home visit, Mom said rather few things. I remember this one .. "His dad goes to office 7 days a week, but I have to deal with him 7 days a week."
