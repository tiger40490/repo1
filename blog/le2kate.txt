Hi Kate,

After witnessing your home visit, I now regard you and your team as a key, if not the primary, support for my family. You are the only one who had multiple in-depth conversations with each family member.

When I describe Yixin or Mom in terms of their words, actions, reactions... to other investigators, they hear only me. It's hard for me to be factual, impartial and complete every time. It's hard to avoid misleading representations. The listeners can't talk to Yixin, and never have confidence that they have the full picture of my family.

For example, I told many invesigators "Yixin only spoke to FSC social worker for 10 minutes each time and unwilling to open up to her, because Yixin preferred male counsellors." On Friday, I saw that he opened up to you.

I didn't overhear everything between Yixin and you, but I had the impression that Yixin was cooperative and polite to you, showing sensibility, willingness to listen, and patience to explain himself in details. It begged the question "Why is he so nasty to parents?" 

Mom vs Dad - who is nicer? I was startled when Yixin said that nowadays he was closer to Mom than Dad. It implied that, as expected, Dad was ONCE nicer than Mom. What has alienated Dad more than Mom? I guess "police" is one reason. (Another might be my style of harsh, painful, repeated criticsm.) Yixin may or may not sense the indignation and determination in me -- Yixin's use of physical force against female family members must stop, including his punching, unwelcome hugging, door pounding, door blocking, late-night loud music, phone snatching..... Neglected and dismissed by everyone is the risk of accidental injury. 
I called in police to stop these physical conflicts and physical risks. If I'm not nice, so be it.

Angry yelling .. I have never paid attention to my reaction to Yixin's yelling. Physical aggression has been my focus. I guess Yixin's angry yelling is better than his aggressive actions, often without anger. I said "better" as it is better in terms of safety and in terms of intimidation. Yelling doesn't require crisis management. As an anger-management choice, yelling is a middle ground between physical-action and suppressed anger. I often engage in angry yelling.

midnight music .. I will focus on Mom/meimei. If they can sleep, then I will consider the music volume acceptable. I will plead with my son to be considerate of his father, and leave the decision to himself. In our Tokyo stay, he shared a small room with me and he did minimize music volume for me.

Multiple investigators asked me what changed in Oct/Nov that led to the escalation of conflicts.
Answer 1: nothing changed that led to Yixin's mistreatment of Mom. Same behavior for a long time. Tension boiled over only because I started calling police. I dared not do so when Yixin was cramming for O-levels. (He would be affected by police, or he could retaliate and threaten to skip an exam.)

Answer 2: The exam cram also emboldened him to stand firm against bathing and against early sleep, as if it would affect his mood for study. Yixin seemed to know exactly what he needs to do and what he must not do, in order to maximize cramming. His erratic study/sleep schedule also made him uninterested in family meals or unsweetened water. By the end of O-levels, parents have developed a strong perception of a stone-cold, irritable/ill-tempered, self-centered, self-isolated, self-sabotaging, deaf and stubborn teenager.

Answer 3: Yixing's existing anti-social behavior intensified during the O-levels. For example, he insisted on loud music as "I absolutely need it tonight, to study for tomorrow's exam."

Answer 4: exam cram disrrupted our family bonding times. We used to have weekly outings -- cycling, beach time, movie night, game night. (I used to have regular chats with Yixin after midnight.) I get the sense (without data) that this wheel ground to a halt sometime in August 2024. After O-levels, the wheel is tentatively restarting. We had a bit of family outing, but Yixin was determined to "have it my way, or no way". 

During our Tokyo trip, Yixin would arrive at airport much later than the rest of the family. Once, he insisted on taking subway by himself when the rest took a taxi. More than once he arrived right before gate closing, as the final passenger. He would also arrive, by himself, at train stations close to departure time when departure frequence was hourly. In those examples, he was repeatedly told, but rejected, the notion of buffer and margin of safety. 

When the family was looking for a restaurant in Tokyo shopping streets, he would take 20 to 40 minutes and dismiss dozens of restaurants. Often other family members would tell him "We are hungry". Mom would tell him "Make up your mind in 10 more minuets" but he would ignore it. More than half the time, I gave up after 10 minutes and returned to hotel myself. 

Tokyo subway trains have last trains around midnight. Yixin would frequently catch them, knowing the risk of missing the last train. This risk was worse when temperature dropped near zero, and Yixin's sister and mother had no choice but follow him around (only Yixin understands Tokyo subway).
