More empathy, more understanding, more listening, more patience ... are required to rebuild the bond with my son, but perhaps we also need to consider how to prevent injuries and physical tussle at home. Problem is, any legal process would immediately jeopardize the parent-son relationship.

Parent's complete, total loss of authority over Yixin. Yixin is fearless and beyond parental control .. He needs some fear of authority, a healthy dose of it.

Police's priority .. 1) injury 2) anyone living in fear. (Heart attack risk is not a priority to police.)

Use of physical force at home has become an everyday event, effectively normalized, but we have forgotten its danger. In this climate, the strong dominates the weak. Daily door-slamming is a neglected source of injury. Some family members (unnamed and unconfirmed) have pointed weapons at one another in self-defense, presumably to say "I'm serious."

Whenever I apply force to take a device from Yixin's hands I always do it with a justification, and in the capacity of a parent. Admittedly, It is always dangerous for a teenager's parent to use force, but even more dangerous is Yixin's reaction -- He would use force to resist. This practice has to stop. That requires me to call police on a weekly basis.

Police won't care about furniture smashing, but up to 2022, we had had 2 doors damaged beyond repair, both by an angry Yixin. Yixin also threw chairs on the floor in retaliation to my forceful action (on his laptop).

Zofia's opposition to court/police/custody .. Yixin is clever to exploit Zofia's opposition. 

Zofia might, as a last resort, threaten a divorce (or a separation) to stop my attempt to call in law enforcement. Law enforcement is available to prevent physical harm in the family, but I suspect that deep inside, she would rather get injured (during a tussle) than get Yixin investigated. 

I have reassured my wife, my parents and my son that police won't arrest him given no crime and no physical harm has taken place.

Yixin is growing fear-Less about Police/court/MentalHospital. Whenever I mention those, Yixin would accuse me, often in front of Mom. ("A loving parent would never do that.") On the other hand, Yixin is clever enough to present a "typical rebellious teenager" image to investigators. He is increasingly confident that the authorities would leave it as a minor family issue.
