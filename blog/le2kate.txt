Hi Kate,

I told you it's nearly impossible to avoid triggering Yixin's anger. Here are some random factors.

Noise after midnight .. Yixin always sleeps past 3am (6am nowadays) and he always listens to his phone in the living room. He used to listen in his room and used put on headphones (we bought so many branded ones), but since late 2024 has refused without giving a real reason. I hate to say that he doesn't care about family members any more. This is something I can avoid, but if I ever stand firm, he would get angry. He might shout, or he might ignore me.

last-minute rush .. Nowadays he has a habit to to postpone some important action to the last minute and create immense stress for Mom. Examples include flight booking and JAE submission. We parents can't prevent this event because Yixin is the decision maker. During the last-minute rush, emotions run high, and conflicts arise.

no-show ... after an agreed family outing. It triggers frustration in the parents (usually Mom) rather than Yixin. That frustration can boil over and prompt Mom to say or do something harsh, unforgiving. You can see an exmaple of the violent consequences in the 6 Jan 2025 incident.

Mom refusing to go out with Yixin .. can trigger Yixin's soft violence such as lock-out or phone confiscation. 

Mom plead with Yixin every day to brush teeth, wash hair, change his sweaty T-shirt after 5D wearing. Mom's nagging may not be a trigger, but nagging invites push-back and resentment. Yixin may slam a door or lash out. Mom may react. Things escalate.

unwalcome and non-stop hugging .. For no reason, Yixin may decide to start hugging mom during her cooking or dinner. Real distress. If mom (usually me) gets tough with him, anything can happen.

Mom's shower .. For no reason, Yixin may start harrassing Mom during her evening shower. (Heater off, light off, kicking door, blocking door from closing...) Real distress. If Mom (or I) get tough with him, anything can happen.

Mom's cooking .. For no known reason, Yixin may say mom's cooking is 臭饭. This is unprovoked anger. Mom would feel hurt. If she says anything negative, it might trigger Yixin's escalation. 

Mom's cooked dinner .. For months Mom have to prepare dinner for Yixin and leave it on table overnight. Yixin refuses to eat more than one meal and he decides when to eat it. He often eats at 3,4 or 5am or skips his single meal. Cooked food goes bad and Mom often dumps them in bin, with a sigh, with a bang (plates), or with a nagging complaint. Yixin usually ignores her but he could react "Why did you dump it. I haven't eaten anything!"

Home wifi .. Yixin may find home wifi unusable and get frustrated with not just Starhub but me who bought it. He may ask me to call starhub. If I'm busy he usually accepts. But if I say something harsh or ignores him completely, his resentment may grow. Yixin once dumped his school laptop on dining table in frustration. That could damage the device, but he didn't care.

These situations are not at the level of "violence", but they are a breeding ground for angry confrontations and outbursts of a volatile ODD sufferer. They are a breeding groud because we live with this person under one roof and we care about him, and he messes up our everyday lives. Parents are not saints and we can't always keep perfect cool.
