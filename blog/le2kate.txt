10 Jan outburst
Yixin was hopeful about O-level results. After he woke up (like 1 pm) on 10 Jan, Yixin and Mom arranged for family dinner at Somerset to celebrate the anticipated good news.

For the 20th day, Yixin refused to shower, brush teeth or wash face, so he went out to school 2 pm in his unclean appearance. (We don't know why he chose this appearance, but I think he disregards many social norms.)

No news from him for hours. His phone battery had already been half-dead since Nov 2024 (He refused to replace it.) so Mom couldn't call him.

Sometime after 8pm, because meimei was already hungry, Mom decided to bring her to eat at Yixin's favorite Somerset restaurant, hoping that Yixin would call her and then join her (as he did before). I was also waiting in office but no news.

I was decisive in supporting Mom's decision. I told her "You can't wait for him indefinitely. If hungry already, then you should eat. Don't worry. Yixin would understand. I know him. I trust him." ... wrong prediction. I underestimated Yixin's condition.

23:21 on 10 Jan, I received a wechat from Mom "请你快点回来救命吧,我快死了". I reached home around 23:30. Yixin had just cycled to home in the rain (rather than MRT!), in a wet, dirty (and scary) appearance (perhaps like an angry drunkard??). I also found Mom in the living room, speechless, in tears, shaking with anger. I could tell she was trying to be brave but was fearful. Immediately, I decided to stay calm and play peace-keeper, as I did before. In hind sight, this felt like a curtain-opening scene in a horror movie, except this was real life.

Mom then told me what had happened. Yixin was devastated by his results, and had become angry because Mom finished dinner without him. So he demanded Mom to accompany him to a Serangoon restaurant. Yixin was convinced that restaurant alone had the comfort food he needed tonight.

I decided to join Mom to calm him down (supportive, uplifting stance), explain to and persuade my son, but he dismissed every help and explanation:
* both parents are feeling unwell on 10 Jan, sneezing, coughing, runny nose
* Mom said she got up 6am on 10 Jan, and now is midnight, so she needed rest
* I said I can go, instead of Mom
* He could go by himself if he didn't like dad's company
(After Mom conceded)
* Since no more MRT, we offered to call taxi, but Yixin firmly believed that taxi would ruin his experience. He insisted that Mom cycles with him to Serangoon in rain.

After an hour of excruciating negotiation with Yixin (yelling, and glass punching), I realized this engagement would go on for hours. Yixin usually goes to bed 4am, 5am or 7am, so very likely Mom and me would not get to sleep until 3am on 11 Jan! I told him repeatedly that both parents understood his feelings, but Mom needed rest, and Mom was already in physical pain and emotional pain. He completely ignored all that! I felt the situation was hopeless, unsustainable and unstable -- I might lose my calm as the peace-keeper, lose my "unconditional love" and might say something "firm" to Yixin.

( I had learned from experience, that any "firm" stance would send a hostile signal to him and can trigger an angry outburst. )

Then came the turning point -- I was feeling "I can't endure another 2 hours." so I picked up my phone. Yixin challenged me "Are you calling police again." I said "No you didn't cause any harm. I only want to call counselling to control my emotions. I don't want to smash things." Yixin soon grew aggressive "Yes, I dare you to smash. I don't want you to tell your counsellers about me."

Later, when I approached him to examine his bleeding fingers, he suddenly snatched my phone and smashed it. I was shocked but calm. I picked up my phone and went out, explaining to Yixin that I would Not call police.

Once outside, I failed to find any helpline, so I went back home, but was locked out by Yixin. I pleaded "Please open the door, otherwise I have to call police." He refused because "You didn't listen to me. You called your counsellor." I dialed 999 but soon Mom unlocked the door, so I hang up 999 without giving any personal details. 999 had a record of my number and my earlier 999 emergency calls. They dispatched 2 officers "just in case another incident happened in this household."

When I saw police at lift lobby, I stopped them. I told them "No harm done. No risk of physical conflict. You can leave. If you still go in, my son would hate me and may punish me." (I was scared of offending and alienating Yixin.) Police decided to go in. Police noticed my damaged phone, the furniture damaged by Yixin's fist and open wound on Yixin's fist. They asked and answered a lot of questions. I believe there was no offense by Yixin, except smashing my phone. I was glad they didn't scold him.

From 11.30 pm until police arrived, Yixin was beyond control and beyond reasoning, angry, fearless and refused to let go of Mom. We all hoped that some hard lessons could bring him to his senses, or to his repentance. Wishful thinking. He believed he was right and Mom was guilty (breaking her dinner promise). He believed Dad was wrong to call police, not only on 10 Jan but in every single incident. He never looked into himself to see what was wrong.

Police was able to control him, brought him to calm. Without police it would have been a night without peace, without rest, and with deeper pains and wounds in Mom and me. It seemed that Yixin had so much pain in him (O-level results, and Mom's broken promise), it has transformed into a powerful negative energy that would keep him demanding Mom's submission. In fact, half-way through the negotiation, Mom did conceded. "It's past midnight and raining. I can go with you to that restaurant by taxi.". Yixin refused and demand cycling instead.

Without police, there was no way for me or Mom to overcome Yixin's energy and power. If I were to stand "firm", it could easily trigger a physical conflict such as smashing or worse. Unfortunately, I had no power over him.

I believe Yixin would try to escape every time before the police arrives. I think 10 Jan might be the only time police is able to hold him down and talk to him in-depth. From the non-verbal communications, it was clear to me Yixin hated police intervention, interrogation, and fact-finding. I think he had something to hide, perhaps his motivation, his inability to control anger, his (powerful and extreme) attitude towards parents.. Unlike counsellors, police don't worry about Yixin walking away. They collected valuable data from Yixin. On the two recent smash scenes, I felt lucky that police were able to collect evidence and eye-witness reports beyond my verbal description. Data collected are instrumental and will enable me to engage with authorities and external help.

Q: risk of divorce?
Police brought up a real question about risk of divorce in families with a violent son... Mom and dad can have serious parenting disagreements. Hearing it, Mom and me both nodded. She often accused me of ruining YIxin's future by calling in law enforcement.

Q: risk of self-harm or suicide?
One counsellor asked me about this risk. I said I do see it in Mom. in 2024, she did say a few times "This life is too tough. I can't live this life any longer. 活不下去了"
