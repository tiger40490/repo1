10 Jan outburst

Yixin was hopeful about O-level results. After he woke up (like 1 pm) on 10 Jan, Yixin and Mom arranged for family dinner at Somerset to celebrate the anticipated good news.

For the 20th day, Yixin refused to shower, brush teeth or wash face, so he went out to school 2 pm in his unclean appearance. (We don't know why he chose this appearance, but I think he disregards many social norms.)

No news from him for hours. His phone battery had already been half-dead since Nov 2024 (He refused to replace it.) so Mom couldn't call him.

Sometime after 8pm, since meimei was already hungry, Mom decided to bring her to eat at Yixin's favorite Somerset restaurant, hoping that Yixin would call her and then join her as he did before. I was also waiting in office but no news.

I came home around 11.30 pm. Yixin had just returned home. He cycled home in the rain (rather than MRT), with a very bad appearance. I also found Mom in the living room, speechless, in tears, furious and frustrated. I decided to stay calm and play peace-keeper.

Mom then told me what happened. Yixin was devasted by his results, and had become angry that Mom had dinner without him. He then urged her to accompany him to a Serangoon restaurant. Yixin was in real pain due to his results, and he was convinced that restaurant alone had the comfort food he needed.

I then joined Mom to explain and persuade Yixin, but he refused to accept any help or explanation:
* both parents are feeling unwell on 10 Jan, sneezing, coughing, runny nose
* Mom said she got up 6am and now is midnight, so she needs to sleep
* I said I can go, instead of Mom
* Since no more MRT, we offered taxi, but Yixin firmly believed that taxi would ruin his experience. He insisted that Mom cycles with him to Serangoon in rain.

After an hour of excruciating negotiation with Yixin (yelling, and furniture punching), I realized this engagement would go on for hours. Yixin went to bed 4am, 5am or 7am, so very likely Mom and me would not get to sleep until 3am. I told him repeatedly that both parents understood his feelings about results, but Mom needed rest, and Mom was already in physical pain and emotional pain. He completely ignored all that! I felt the situation was hopeless unsustainable and unstable -- I might lose my calm as the peace-keeper, lose my "unconditional love" and might say something "firm" to Yixin.

( I had learned from experience, that any "firm" stance would send a hostile signal to him and can trigger an angry outburst. )

Then came the turning point -- I was feeling "I can't endure another 2 hours." so I picked up my phone. Yixin challenged me "Are you calling police again." I said "No you didn't cause any harm. I only want to call counselling to manage my emotional pains." Yixin soon grew aggressive "I don't want you to tell your counsellers about me." He then snatched my phone and smashed it. I was shocked but calm. I picked up my phone and went out, explaining to Yixin that I would Not call police.

Once outside, I failed to find any helpline, so I went back home, but was locked out by Yixin. I pleaded "Please open the door, otherwise I have to call police." He refused because "You didn't listen to me. You called your counsellor." I dialed 999 but soon Mom unlocked the door, so I hang up 999 without giving any personal details. 999 had a record of my number and my earlier 999 emergency calls. They dispatched 2 officers "just in case another incident happened in this household."

When I saw police at lift lobby, I stopped them. I told them "No harm done. No risk of physical conflict. You can leave. If you still go in, my son would hate me and may punish me." (I was scared of offending and alienating Yixin.) Police decided to go in. Police noticed my damaged phone, the furniture damaged by Yixin's fist and open wound on Yixin's fist. They asked and answered a lot of questions. I believe there was no offense by Yixin, except smashing my phone. I was glad they didn't scold him.

From 11.30 pm until police arrived, Yixin was beyond control and beyond reasoning, angry, fearless and refused to let go of Mom. He believed he was right and Mom was guilty (breaking her dinner promise). He didn't like Dad even though I was playing my best peace-keeper. Police was able to control him, brought him to calm. Without police it would have been a night without peace, without rest, and with deeper pains in Mom and dad. I think Yixin had so much pain in him (O-level results, and Mom's brokenn promise), it has transformed into a powerful negative energy that would keep him demanding Mom's submission. In fact, half-way through the negotation, Mom did conceded. "It's past midnight and raining. I can go with you to that restaurant by taxi.". Yixin refused and demand cycling instead. 

Without police, there was no way for me or Mom to overcome Yixin's energy and power. If I were to stand "firm", it could easily trigger a physical conflict such as smashing or worse. Unfortunately, I had no power over him.

I felt luck that police were able to collect evidence and eye-witness reports beyond my verbal description. Data collected will help me engage with authorities and external help. 

Q: risk of divorce?
Police brought up a real question about risk of divorce in families with a violent son... Mom and dad can have serious parenting disagreements. We both nodded. My wife often accused me of ruining YIxin's future by calling in law enforcement.

Q: risk of self-harm or suicide?
One counsellor asked me about this risk. I said I do see it in Mom. in 2024, she did say a few times "This life is too tough. I can't live this life any longer.", mostly due to Yixin's ODD.
