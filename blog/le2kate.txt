(Part of this mail was a re-write of a previous mail.)

After the 17 Dec laptop-smash, I thought Yixin had learned a hard lesson.

Today's (6 Jan 2025) outburst was less damaging than laptop smash. Also, there was no (minor) body injury as on 17 Dec. I can only guess that Yixin found today's smash an effective release of an otherwise harmful, uncontrollable heat and pressure inside his body. In such a case, smashing furniture is better than harming a person (self included) or animal. To a lesser extent, smashing a forgettable furniture is also better than smashing an object of personal value such as an award item, a personal gift, a photograph, a souvenir, a favorite toy, a display item, a delicate object,,,  I think Yixin still had a bit of semi-conscious self-control when he chose this simple chair (see the picture in whatsapp). 

I wrote these details because it is important, IMHO, to recognize the degree of his violent behavior. In fact, after each angry moment I have often reminded my son:
* You are bigger than your sister and mother, and you must never hit them except in self-defence. Never.
* smashing is better than hurting
* yelling is better than smashing (even after midnight)
* yelling before midnight is better than after midnight
* I am not condoning angry yelling. 

One element of ODD is revenge. I see revenge in all three outbursts 14 Dec to 6 Jan.

Not-to-do suggestions:
Sugg (to myself): when Yixin is angry, stand firm but avoid escalation.
Sugg (to myself): if no real risk of injury, then avoid calling police.
Sugg: avoid giving provocative remarks to Yixin, even if he challenges our authority

To-do Suggestions:
Sugg: tear paper, with sound
Sugg: throw a bouncing ball at the wall, to release anger
Sugg: install a punchbag in his room, but this will cost time and money and may not help.
Sugg: research on the Australian youth camp
Sugg: when his anger reaches a certain level, suggest to him to go into a room. He can try yelling from his room, and parents can choose not to respond.
sugg: when his anger reaches a certain level, most family members can leave the scene. One parent can remain at home. This can prevent escalation of conflict.
Sugg: FSC to continue caregiver support for Zofia. However calm, strong she could be sometimes, she is not immune.

My new modest goal -- Yixin's violence remains at or below the level of smashing non-personal items. No hurting. No damage to personal items as revenge. I hope a realistic goal helps me cope with anxiety, hypertension, lost sleep.
