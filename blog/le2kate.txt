Hi Kate,

I told you it's nearly impossible to avoid triggering Yixin's anger. Here are some random factors and examples.

Noise after midnight .. Yixin always sleeps past 3am (6am nowadays) and he always listens to his phone in the living room. He used to listen in his room and used put on headset, but since late 2024 has  refused without giving a real reason. I hate to say that he doesn't care about family members. This is something I can avoid -- If I ever stand firm, he would get angry. He might shout, or he might ignore me. 

last-minute rush .. He decides to postpone some action to the last minute and create immense stress for mom. Examples include flight booking and JAE submission. We parents can't prevent it because Yixin is the decision maker. During the last-minute rush, emotions run high, and conflicts arise.

Mom's cooking .. For no known reason, Yixin may say mom's cooking is 臭饭. This is unprovoked anger. Mom would feel hurt. If she says anything negative, it might trigger Yixin's escalation. 

Mom plead with Yixin every day to brush teeth, wash hair, change his dirty clothes after wearing for 5 days. This may not be a trigger, but is nagging. Nagging invites push-back and resentment. Yixin may lash out. Mom may react. Things escalate.

Hugging .. For no reason, Yixin may decide to start hugging mom during her cooking or dinner. Real distress. If mom (usually me) gets tough with him, anything can happen.

Mom's shower .. For no reason, Yixin may start harrassing Mom during her evening shower. (Heater off, light off, kicking door, blocking door from closing...) Real distress. If Mom (or I) get tough with him, anything can happen.

Home wifi .. Yixin may find home wifi unusable and get frustrated with not just Starhub but me who bought it. He may ask me to call starhub. If I'm busy he usually accepts. But if I say something harsh or ignores him completely, his resentment may grow.
