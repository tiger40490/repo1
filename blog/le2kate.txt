More empathy, more understanding, more listening, more patience ... are required to rebuild the bond with my son, but perhaps we also need to consider legal protection to prevent injuries. Problem is, any legal process would immediately jeopardize the parent-son relationship.

Parent's complete, total loss of authority over Yixin. (Any evidence of authority is a mirage, as I explained in my 6Nov email.) Yixin is fearless and beyond parental control .. He needs a healthy dose of fear-of-law.

Police's priority .. 1) injury 2) no one should live in fear. (My heart condition is not a priority to police.) 

Use of physical force at home ... has become an everyday event, effectively normalized, but we have forgotten its danger. Daily door-slamming is a neglected source of injury. 
Some family members (unnamed and unconfirmed) have pointed weapons at one another.

Police won't care about furniture damage, but up to 2022, we had had 2 doors damaged beyond repair, both by an angry Yixin. Yixin also threw chairs on the floor in protest to my forcible action.

Yixin is nearly fearless about Police/court/mentalHospital. Whenever I mention those, Yixin would accuse me, often in front of Mom. ("A loving parent would never do that.") On the other hand, Yixin is clever enough to present a "typical rebellious teenager" image to investigators. He is increasingly confident that the authorities would leave it as a minor family issue.

Zofia's opposition to court/police/custody .. Yixin is clever to exploit Zofia's opposition. 

Zofia may use divorce to stop my attempt to engage with law-enforcement. They are available to prevent physical harm in my family, but I guess she would rather get injured (during a tussle) than send my son to court.
