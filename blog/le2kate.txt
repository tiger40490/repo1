Hi Kate,

Psychiatric diagnosis .. no objection, no urgency. Now that Yixin has stablized in his anti-social behaviors, I feel we can wait-n-see.

Example: 21 Feb night Yixin came home after 1 am (22 Feb), and started making noises by slamming the metal gate and leaping all over the living room (his favorite home exercise). This lasted some unknown amount of time (I was half-conscious) until I got up, opened my bedroom door and complained about the recurring noise. Yixin questioned me "Am I jumping now?" I said I didn't remember when he last made the leaping noise but I needed it stopped. He said absolutely nothing and stopped his exercise.

Labelling .. a real risk. If we receive a psychiatric diagnosis, this label can leave a permanent mark, like a scar on the self-image. So I don't want my son to get a specific diagnosis. The unconfirmed ODD diagnosis is enough for now. Thanks to your suggestion, we didn't use private ambulance to send him to IMH by force.

Calling police .. I accept Yixin's proposal "Dad can call police if both parents agree." Unless I can persuade Zofia, I will leave the scene and let Zofia deal with Yixin. 

Your role .. I think you can help my wife and my daughter. I feel Elaina may prefer a female professional. I don't want to overload you with my own parenting problems. I think my wife trust you more than she trusts other professionals.
