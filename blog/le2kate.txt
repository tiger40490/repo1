Yixin's long-time teacher has shed light, though for her privacy I can't quote her verbatim -- 

I've actually noticed that Yixin is 'principled' in not such an unusual way; he just doesn't do what he doesn't believe in. He is unwilling to empathise with others or do something for the sake of others if it means compromising what he believes in. A simple example: he refuses to report by the reporting time for the exam because he strongly believes it doesn't matter (and it's proven it doesn't, strengthening his belief) as it doesn't affect his results. Even if his mother kneels and pleads, he will not budge for her sake. Sadly, he is unwilling to give up (even the smallest of) self for others.

Yixin's recent anti-social behavior can be categorized as mucking around, creating distress in family members (most severely poor Mom). I don't see a single trace of bully or aggressive behavior towards people outside the family. 

I guess that as early as lower secondary school, Yixin has been observed to attack Mom and sister by pushing them off balance. Once outside Toa Payoh MRT, I saw him pushing Mom really rough from behind. She nearly fell. He did it in anger and didn't apologize. 

Now I see a history of behavior emerging. He has been mistreating mom for years without real consequence or resistance. All Mom can do is plea for mercy, kneeling down, sobing or wailing, Throwing objects, or walk out. If walks out, she may get a call from Yixin scolding her for not cooking ... for him.

My recent bold decision (to call in police repeatedly) shocked him and perhaps alienated him. I was reminded of an advisor's pointer "As the only grown-up man in the house, your job is not to please your son." However, I have to be extremely careful about maintaining whatever bond and communication channel there is with my son. Among other things I must give reasons, and earn his respect.

If Mom dared to call the police, Yixin would present a "typical rebellious teenager" image to the police. Police won't touch him, and may not even scold him. After they leave, he would silently send a message as loud as a lion's roar -- "I will make you pay. I will not come home before midnight and reject all your calls from now on (he did). I will reach school late (he did). I will skip first half of every tuition (he did). I will not drink water for a full day (he did). I will not listen or talk to you (he did). You know what -- you have destroyed my future, and lost my respect, as soon as you called in the stupid police. No loving parent would do this to their son."
