Hi Kate,

Over the last few days, Zofia has shown increasing signs of intolerance of Yixin's BO (body odor). She complains the entire house is smelly. She tries to clean the sofa that Yixin used. She said many times that she can't tolerate the small in the house. 

Clearly, the BO is not as obvious as, say, rotten food or human waste. I can barely smell anything 10 cm from Yixin. 

I told her (and will tell her again) that my late father used to shower once a few months, but was free of sweat or BO.

I think Zofia is sometimes beyond reasoning. Intolerance is a serious condition, so we need to look for alternative accommodations, where Zofia and Elaina can stay temporarily. Can you help? I will pay.
