Yixin's violent/aggressive actions have stopped.

Yixin's self-care showed no improvement: 
* no shower
* no tooth brushing as far as I know
* no effort to regulate meal timing
* refusing to see doctor despite parent's urging

Below, I recorded the 16 Feb impunctuality incident, just to avoid memory loss. Around 3pm, while in office I received a message from Zofia to rendezvous at AMK for a 4pm family biking excursion. 3.50 pm I reached AMK and met Mom and Elaina. Mom said Yixin had accepted 4pm rendezvous. Before and after 4, Mom called Yixin repeatedly but couldn't find him. I think Mom did speak to Yixin once and he said "arriving very soon" but 10 minutes later still nothing. Around 4.15 Yixin called Mom's phone but somehow Elaina answered the call. That's the only time (that I know) when he tried to inform us. Around 4.20 he arrived at the rendezvous point. When I asked, he explained that his phone battery was flat. However it has been flat for months and he has never bothered to replace it.

Looking back, this 20-minute of "keep others waiting on the street" is a short wait. Yixin used to keep Mom (and Elaina) waiting on the street for an hour while declining all calls.

At 3.50, when I heard that Yixin had accepted 4pm, I immediately said he may not show up. Zofia said that 3 of us would leave at 4pm without him, but when 4pm came, she didn't leave. This is the same pattern of behavior in Zofia. I think this is a such a convincing pattern, like 10 out of 10 times, that made Yixin believe he can "mistreat" Mom this way. (In contrast, I don't remember Yixin ever kept me waiting on the street for more than 10 minutes beyond an agreed time.) So far, there is no real consequence so Yixin may continue this behavior.

Yixin needs counselling but he has refused. I don't think CPS has a job to deal with this issue but CPS can set up compulsory counselling.
