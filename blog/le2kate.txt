Hi Kate,

After witnessing your home visit, I now regard you and your team as a key, if not the primary, support for my family. You are the only one who had multiple in-depth conversations with each family member.

When I describe Yixin or Mom in terms of their words, actions, reactions... to other investigators, they hear only me. It's hard for me to be factual, impartial and complete every time. It's hard to avoid misleading representations. The listeners can't talk to Yixin, and never have confidence that they have the full picture of my family.

For example, I told many invesigators "Yixin only spoke to FSC social worker for 10 minutes each time and unwilling to open up to her, because Yixin preferred male counsellors." On Friday, I saw that he opened up to you.

I didn't overhear everything between Yixin and you, but I had the impression that Yixin was cooperative and polite to you, showing sensibility, willingness to listen, and patience to explain himself in details. It begged the question "Why is he so nasty to parents?" 

Mom vs Dad - who is nicer? I was startled when Yixin said that nowadays he was closer to Mom than Dad. It implied that, as expected, Dad was ONCE nicer than Mom. What has alienated Dad more than Mom? I guess "police" is one reason. (Another might be my style of harsh, painful, repeated criticsm.) Yixin may or may not sense the indignation and determination in me -- Yixin's use of physical force against female family members must stop, including his punching, unwelcome hugging, door pounding, door blocking, late-night loud music, phone snatching..... Neglected and dismissed by everyone is the risk of accidental injury. 
I called in police to stop these physical conflicts and physical risks. If I'm not nice, so be it.

Angry yelling .. I have never paid attention to my reaction to Yixin's yelling. Physical aggression has been my focus. I guess Yixin's angry yelling is better than his aggressive actions, often without anger. I said "better" as it is better in terms of safety and in terms of intimidation. Yelling doesn't require crisis management. As an anger-management choice, yelling is a middle ground between physical-action and suppressed anger. I often engage in angry yelling.

midnight music .. I will focus on Mom/meimei. If they can sleep, then I will consider the music volume acceptable. I will plead with my son to be considerate of his father, and leave the decision to himself. In our Tokyo stay, he shared a small room with me and he did minimize music volume for me.
