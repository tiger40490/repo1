Hi Kate,

After witnessing your home visit, I now see you as a key (if not the primary) support for my family. You are the only one who had multiple in-depth conversations with each family member.

When I describe Yixin or Mom (their words, actions, reactions) to other investigators (they hear only me), it's hard for me to be factual, impartial and complete. It's hard to avoid misleading representations. The listeners can't talk to Yixin and never have confidence that they have the full picture.

For example, I told many invesigators that Yixin only spoke to FSC social worker for 10 minutes each time and unwilling to open up to her, because Yixin preferred male counsellors. On Friday, I saw that he opened up to you.

I didn't overhear everything between Yixin and you, but I had the impression that Yixin was polite and cooperative to you, showing sensibility, willingness to listen, and patience to explain himself in details. Why was he so nasty to parents? 

Mom vs Dad - who is nicer? I was startled when Yixin said that nowadays he is closer to Mom than Dad. It implied that, as expected, Dad was Once nicer than Mom. What has alienated Dad more than Mom? I guess "police" is one reason. Yixin may or may not sense the indignation and determination in me -- Yixin's use of physical force against female family members must stop, including his punching, unwelcome hugging, door pounding, door blocking, music affecting meimei's sleep, phone snatching..... Neglected and dismissed by everyone is the risk of accidental injury. 
I called in police to stop these physical acts and risks. If I'm not nice, so be it.

Angry yelling .. I have never paid attention to my reaction to Yixin's yelling. (Physical aggression has been my focus.) I guess Yixin's yelling is better than his (often without anger) aggressive actions. Better in terms of safety, in terms of intimidation. Yelling doesn't require crisis management. As an anger-management choice, yelling is a middle ground between physical-action and suppressed anger. Maybe I will guide Yixin in yelling?

midnight music .. I will focus on Mom/meimei. If they can sleep, then I will consider the volume acceptable. I will plead with my son to be considerate of his father.

Multiple investigators asked me what changed recently that led to the escalation (now de-escalation)
Answer: nothing changed that led to Yixin's bullying/mistreatment of Mom. Same behavior for a long time. Tension boiled over only because I started calling in police. I dared not do so when Yixin was cramming for O-levels. (He would be affected by police, or he would retaliate and threaten to skip an exam.)

Answer: The exam cram also emboldened him to stand firm against bathing and against early sleep, as if it would affect his mood for study. Yixin seemed to know exactly what he needs to do and what he must not do, in order to maximize cramming. His erratic study/sleep schedule also made him uninterested in family meals or plain drinking water. By the end of this ordeal, parents have developed a strong perception of a stone-cold, irritable/ill-tempered, self-centered, self-isolated, self-sabotaging, deaf and stubborn teenager.

Answer: Yixing's existing anti-social behavior intensified during the O-levels ordeal. For example, he insisted on loud music as "I absolutely need it tonight, to study for tomorrow's exam."

Answer: exam cram disrrupted our family bonding times. We used to have weekly outings -- cycling, beach time, movie night, game night. I used to have some regular chats with Yixin after midnights. I get the sense (without data) that our wheel ground to a halt sometime in Aut or Sep and never restarted.
