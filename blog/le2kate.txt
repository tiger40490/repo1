Hi Kate,

(My first draft) I told you it's tough to avoid triggering Yixin's anger. (He is highly volatile.) Here are some random factors.

Noise after midnight .. Yixin always sleeps past 3am (6am nowadays) and he always listens to his phone in the living room. He used to listen in his room and used to put on headphones (we bought so many branded ones), but since late 2024 has refused. I hate to say that he doesn't care about family members any more. I can avoid it but if I ever stand firm, he would get upset. He might shout, or he might ignore me.

Last-minute rush .. Nowadays he has a habit to to postpone some important action to the last minute and create immense stress for Mom. Examples include exam attendence, flight booking and JAE submission. We parents can't prevent it because Yixin is the decision maker. During the last-minute rush, emotions run high, and conflicts arise. Yixin often threatens no-show if parents urge him too hard.

No-show after a pre-agreed family outing.... It triggers frustration in the parents (usually Mom) not in Yixin. That frustration can boil over and prompt Mom to say or do something harsh, unforgiving, hurting, or hostile. You can see an exmaple of the violent consequences in the 6 Jan 2025 incident.

Mom refusing to go out with Yixin .. (be it cycle, shopping, dining,,,) can trigger Yixin's soft violence such as lock-out or phone confiscation. Yixin feels justified to punish and coerce Mom. 

Mom changing her mind about family outing.. Yixin often changes his mind about family outing [ change of destination, timing, or he couldn't join ] but he has a problem if Mom changes her mind. He often goes crazy and demands an explanation that he considers acceptable. (He is the judge and jury.) Freedom for himself, or Dad, but no freedome for Mom. I find this unfair, but I dare not stand up for my wife. As a result, I often tell Zofia "Don't promise to go somewhere this weekend. Just say you might." The expectation built up in Yixin can be a double-edged sword.

Mom pleads with Yixin every day to brush teeth, wash hair, change his sweaty T-shirt (after 5 days). Mom's nagging may not be a trigger, but nagging invites push-back and resentment. Yixin may slam a door or lash out. Mom may react. Things escalate. Alternatively, Mom loses her cool, and nagging turns into complaint or soft-retaliation... hot trigger

Unwalcome and unrelenting hugging .. For no reason, Yixin may decide to start hugging mom during her cooking or dinner. Real distress. If a parent (usually me) gets tough with him, anything can happen.

Mom's shower .. For no reason, Yixin may start harrassing Mom during her evening shower. (turning heater off; light off; kicking door; blocking door from closing...) Real distress for Mom. If Mom (or I) gets tough with him, anything can happen.

Lying on other people's bed, with his dirty clothes on .. Yixin never puts his shoes on bedsheets, but he finds joy in teasing Mom this way -- The more Mom says he stinks, the more often he would lie flat on other people's clean bedsheet. Mom often screams and pulls him off, but he is too strong. Sounds laughable, but a real distress for Mom. If Mom gets tough with him (rare), anything can happen.

Mom's prepared dinner .. For months Mom have to prepare (usually home-cook) dinner for Yixin and leave it on table overnight. (Yixin forbids me to refrigerate it.) He refuses to eat more than one meal and he decides when to eat it. He often eats at 3,4 or 5am or skips his single meal for the day. Cooked foods go bad and Mom often dumps them, with a bang. Yixin usually ignores her but he sometimes reacts "Why did you dump it. I haven't eaten anything!" More than once he accused Mom of starving him, sometimes furiously.

Trashing Mom's cooking .. For no known reason, Yixin sometimes says mom's cooking is smelly/rotten food (臭饭). This unprovoked eruption in Yixin might be deliberate. Mom feels hurt. If she takes a firm stance, it might trigger Yixin, esp. if he is already fully charged, boiling, waiting for a trigger to lash out.

Blaming Mom for not waking him in time .. We made it clear that at 16 Yixin need to be responsible for his daily wake-up requirement. We bought numerous alarm clocks for Yixin, but he uses only his phone alarm, and it often fails for various reasons. Therefore, Frequently he relied on Mom to wake him up, and inevitable Mom would "fail" her duty once a while. When this happens, we hold our breadth. Yixin can be forgiving , but this has been a real trigger for anger. He is too volatile.

Blaming Mom for washing his clothing .. once Yixin went crazy because Mom washed a dirty shirt, with his classmates's handwriting farewell all over it. Parents pointed out we can't keep the ink on it for ever, but he refused to listen. "You messed up my stuff. You fix it."

Blaming me for discarding "rubish" .. I once found a half-torn advertizing paper lying on sofa for days, so discarded it. Yixin demanded I go to the producer (Popular Bookstore) to get a new copy, because "I need this coupon to save $50." I offered to pay the $50 but he rejected. He couldn't forgive my honest "mistake" of disarding an unlabled, unguarded piece of paper. "You messed up my stuff. You fix it."

Technical glitches at home .. Yixin once dumped his school laptop on a home table with a bang. A bang could damage the device, but he was frustrated and he didn't care. In late 2024, he developed a new habit of tossing not only his phone, but Mom's phone (repeatedly) and my phone (once) on the sofa or on a table. Mom said Yixin's phone screen was cracked for this reason. In addition, Yixin sometimes finds home wifi unusable and get frustrated with not only Starhub but me who chose Starhub. He often urges me to call starhub or replace the starhub devices. I don't like his habits and attitudes, but I must aovid confronting him. Yixin is the boss at home and he is too volatile. Who knows... next time he may smash Starhub devices.

Refusing to answer parents' call or replace battery .. A constant frustration for parents. For about 3 months, Yixin has rejected 100% of my calls. He has started to reject Mom's calls too. When we are outside and need to contact him, he won't answer his phone, or the home phone (if he is home). Part of his explanation is "daed battery" but he refused to replace his battery for months. This is not a trigger for Yixin, but a trigger for parents. We can lose our cool and criticize or nag at him. He usually ignores us.

These situations are not at the level of "violence", but they are a breeding ground for angry confrontations and outbursts of a volatile ODD sufferer. They are a breeding groud because we live with this person under one roof and we care about him, and he messes up our everyday lives. Parents are not saints and we can't always keep perfect cool. 

To Chilld Protection Service and National Anti-Violence Hotline, I want to say this -- Until Yixin is taken away, diagnosed and treated, there will be no peace around Elaina, no harmony in Elain's family, no real protection for Elaina. Elaina will be traumatized every month, and scared every week. Elain's mom will suffer mental breakdown, and Elaina's father (me) will continue to spend some nights away from home to avoid conflict escalation. Elaina will not dare to call 999. So far, I am the only one to call 999. Even after two bloody incidents on 17 Dec 2024 and 10 Jan 2025, Mom refused to call 999.
