Hi Kate,

Psychiatric diagnosis .. no objection, no urgency. Now that Yixin has stablized in his aggressive tendency, I feel we can wait-n-see.

Labelling .. is a real risk, esp. on young people. If we receive a psychiatric diagnosis, this label can leave a permanent mark, like a scar. So I don't want my son to get a diagnosis. Thanks to your suggestion, we didn't use private ambulance to send him to IMH by force.

Your role .. I think you can help my wife and my daughter. I feel Elaina may prefer a female professional. I don't want to overload you with my own parenting problems. 

calling police .. I accept Yixin's proposal "You can call police if both parents agree." Unless I can peraude Zofia, I will leave the scene.
