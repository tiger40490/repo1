10 Jan outburst

Yixin was hopeful about O-level results. When he woke up in the afternoon of 10 Jan, Yixin and Mom arranged for family dinner at Somerset to celebrate his results. 

For the 20th (or 30th) day, Yixin refused to shower, brush teeth or wash face, so he went out to school 2pm in his unclean appearance. (We don't know why he chose this appearance, but I think he disregards many social norms.)

No news from him for hours. His phone battery had already been half-dead since Nov 2024 (He refused to replace it.) so Mom couldn't call him. 

Sometime after 8pm, since meimei was already hungry, Mom decided to bring her to eat at Yixin's favorite Somerset restaurant, hoping that Yixin would call her and then join her. I was also waiting in office but no news.

I came home around 11.30 pm. I found Yixin just returned home (past 11pm). He cycled home in the rain, with a very bad appearance. I also found Mom in the living room, speechless, in tears, furious and devastated. I decided to stay calm and play peace-keeper.

Mom told me what happened. Yixin was angry that Mom ate dinner without him. He then urged her to accompany him to a 24H Serangoon restaurant. Yixin was in real pain due to his results, and he was convinced that restaurant alone had the pain relief food he needed. 

He refused to accept all help or explanation offered by Mom and me:
* Mom said she got up 6am and now is midnight, so she needs to sleep
* I said I can go with Yixin
* Since no more MRT, we offered taxi, but Yixin firmly believed that taxi would ruin the pain-relief experience. He insisted that Mom cycles with him to Serangoon in heavy rain.

After an hour of painful conversation with Yixin (yelling, and furniture punching), I realized this conversaion would go on for hours. Yixin had already shifted his bed time to 5am by then, so very likely Mom and me would not get to sleep until 3am. Both parents were slightly sick on 10 Jan [sneezing, coughing, runny nose]. I told him repeatedly that both parents understood his feelings about results, but Mom needed rest, and Mom was already in physical pain and emotional pain. He completely ignored all that! (I also said I have a heart condition and need to sleep. He ignored it too.) I felt the situation was hopeless and unsustainable .. I might lose my calm as the peace-keeper, lose my "unconditional love" and might say something "firm" to Yixin. I had learned from experience, any "firm" stance would send a hostile signal to him and can trigger an angry outburst.

This is the turning point -- I was feeling "I can't endure another 2 hours." so I picked up my phone. Yixin challenged me "Are you calling police." I said "No you didn't cause any harm. I only need to call counselling to manage my emotional pains." Yixin soon became aggressive "I don't want you to tell your counsellers about me." He then snatched my phone and smashed it. I was shocked but calm. I picked up my phone and went out, explaining to Yixin that I would not call police. 

Once outside, I failed to get through any helpline, so I went back home, but was locked out by Yixin. I pleaded to him "Please open the door, otherwise I have to call police." He refused because "You didn't listen to me. You called your counsellor." I dialed 999 but soon Mom unlocked the door, so I hang up 999 without giving them any personal details. Unknown to me, 999 had a record of my phone number and my earlier 999 emergency calls. They dispatched 2 officers "just in case another incident happened in this houselould." 

When I saw police at lift lobby, I stopped them. I told them "No harm done. No risk of physical conflict. You can leave. If you still go in, my son would hate me and may punish me." (I was scared of offending and alienating Yixin.) Police decidedd to go in. Police did more than their standard work with the 3 family members (am so grateful). They noticed my damaged phone, the furniture dmanaged by Yixin's fist and open wound on Yixin's fist. They asked and ansered a lot of questions. I believe there was no offense by Yixin, except smashing my phone.

From 11.30 pm until police arrived, Yixin was beyond control and beyond reasoning, angry, fearless and refused to let go of his Mom. He believed he was right and Mom was guilty (breaking her dinner promise). He didn't like Dad even though I was playing the peace-keeper. Police was able to control him, brought him to calm. Without police it would have been a night without peace, without rest, and with deeper pains in Mom and dad.
