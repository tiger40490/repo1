For quantity violation, I have looke through my pre-clearance during Jul 2021 ~ Nov 2022. All the small-quantity approvals were observed, without breach. As to the other approvals, the quantity was always sufficiently large.

SONY approved 27 Apr 2022 (TransactionId 486718), bought 0.2 share 3 May, but 2 May is a Singapore public holiday.

==== 3D-check:
clean: MFA approved 8 Jul 2021, bought 13 Jul
clean: AFIN (ticker changed to RTL) approved 31 Jan
clean: NFG approved 6 Feb 2022, bought 7 Feb
