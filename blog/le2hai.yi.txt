You mentioned an unnamed friend with $3.5M net asset. Suppose you also have the same net asset, but you reconnect with an ex-classmate, now worth 10 times higher. How would you feel? 

I think many people in that situation would again feel "I wish I have that 10x wealth." Our aspirations won't stop growing at a certain net asset. Our aspirations are mostly guided by peer comparison. At net asset USD 1.5M, we are well above the world median household net asset, but our "peer" group is 50 times wealthier! So we are really comparing with the ultra rich.

I read a Malaysian magazine. Benchmark for Ultra high net worth is MYR 10,000k = USD 2,400k. Mind you, Malaysia is one of the richest countries in Asia if you exclude tiny nations like Qatar, Brunei, Bahrain, Kuwait (all smaller than Singapore in population).

My answer, as mentioned in our chat -- "I already have enough. I don't need 10 times more."
Basically the Taoist and Buddhist view. This is nothing academic. I didn't read any religious book about these. 

Right now in 2021, I would give the same answer, though I'm not $3.5M rich. Suppose I receive $5M extra money (inheritance or windfall profit) when I migrate to the U.S. The extra money would enable me to hire a maid + professional tutors, buy a home, rather than renting, and enroll my kids to private schools (as you hinted).

But Hey, I don't really NEED any of these, not in Singapore, and hopefully not later in the U.S. 

At our age, each of us, based on the individual circumstances, can draw a line in the sand, between livelihood needs vs aspirations. Those "desires" lie beyond the line because they are luxuries, aspirations, not necessities for a reasonable livelihood. I think my dad would say that to me.

I try to follow this invisible line in the sand. I think that's how I can feel well-off and carefree while others struggle.

I wrote earlier "aspirations won't stop growing", that is, until we say NO to mindless peer comparison, and draw that line in the sand. This is as hard as practicing Buddhism on a daily basis, that's why most people's aspirations won't stop growing.

-- parenting aspirations
I think you seem to subscribe to a belief that more financial resources would produce a better child. I guess the correlation is rather low. I can throw more "help" on my kids and they would not become top of the class. The top students in the class are someone else, not necessarily from a rich family. Beyond certian limit, more financial "help" is not needed. 

Even for a bright child, the limiting factor is usually his own abilities and motivation, not financial resources.

However, I do notice the universal pattern that well-off families tend to produce better students. Granted, financial resources can give our children the best schools and teachers, but that's a minor factor. Financial resources can "buy" earlier intervention, more parenting care and attention, and better healthcare for the child. In my observation, most successful people didn't come from top schools. In fact after the child becomes a young adult, around age 18, the schools and compoanies she gets into depends mostly on her choices and her abilities, less on her family wealth.

One speial domain is organized annual competitions. Those competitions require expensive training over many years, so the correlation between results and financial resources is higher. Well, I'm not interested in those competitions. They are aspirations, not a livelihood requirement.
