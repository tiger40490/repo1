--new: What does a school district meant to me?
It means level of durg prevalance.
I don't care that that much about benchmark score

SG average school is possibl a 7/10 (possibly 10) school district in terms of benchmark and discipline. 
Why do I spend so much on U.S. top school districts (housing, private schools etc) when Singapore is cheaper and better?

--I asked Raymond why Malay students seldom out-perform.
Raymond is confident that IQ is not one of the factors.

He said another factor is that Malay parents have too many kids and too little spare time outside work (often 1.5 to two jobs). Jack He also said affluent families often have full time mom taking care of kids.

Raymond pointed out the hours he spends with his sons.

--develop his confidence in geometry
low hanging fruits
less wordy
more fun
more rewarding

--exam scores don't mean much to my son
At some age, he would realize the importance of these scores.

At age 11 the meaning isn’t so crystal clear in his mind. It only means parents delight/anger/disappointment, and more tuition.

There’s no internal desire for the score. I don’t see the fire in him.

--boy experiences a lot of internal resistance to math practice
I also experience the same with chin-up, stretching and coding drill

If no choice due to strict rule from dad, then not so much suffering and resistance.

Self-discipline is harder.

--Genn's discussion
for math, More nurturing less demanding; instead of telling him what to do, suggest to him.

Rebuild his self-esteem and confidence in math.

He doesn't show all his cards. He may have some special skills; he may feel ashamed sometimes.

Get boy to finish the toughest homework early, before dinner, to fend off the fearful math teacher.

Consider stopping the Science/Eng tuition. It is counter-productive to developing his motivation and self responsibility.

I often show my lack of confidence in his abilities , his luck, his future progress, ,, it would affect him. 

--Japan trip
No need to feel an obligation to "provide" it to boy. 
He has a chance to visit Japan when he grows up.

My parent didn't "provide" such a trip to me and I felt completely fine.

--Chinese parenting, and Buddhism emphasizes self-restraint.
Western culture emphasizes hard driving, achievement, so I think some motivated or high-achievers have limited self-restraint

gaming is the prime example.

--fuxi: my own Eng tuition experience in 1992
The real effective effort is focused exam-prep xx and practice by myself. 
The mental focus is driven by the motivation. 
The 1H/week session is not the catalyst that helped some other students. 

For my son, since he is not motivated enough, there's basically nothing much I can do except strict punishment in the form of deprivation. 

carrot and stick short term tgt-control

--fuxi: lucky my boy is not too skinny or short

--fuxi: 5 lang of love for boy
acts of service
quality time -- keeping company. He doesn't like to be left alone, except with a screen

--new blogpost: I have a problem seeing dabao having fun
I think I have a problem seeing him having fun. I hate to see him enjoying the fun without doing his part.

Both parents probably feel he is too fun-loving. I feel he doesn’t want to earn the right to have fun.

Grandpa felt it’s normal. 

--I'm STILL trying to make my son another tanbin
This tendency is very stubborn and subtle.

He has his own strengths, interests, hobbies, preferred way to solving problems and meeting challenges ....

I have my weaknesses, limitations, faults in my making. Over many years of "adjustment" I have come to terms with some of my limitations. Now I need to accept his limitations. 

Look at Genn. As a parent how would I accept her as she is, rather than a very poor copy of me?

--I should talk to more people with a gaming hobby, or smoking hobby, ... Rahul is one
These individuals could be very motivated, hard-working, high-flying

I think grandpa is a huge influence on me, but perhaps there are some more successful individuals in his circle with some of those habits.

--Q: is the Pungol experience a real reward for boy?

--fuxi: 
after boy does a lot of work, the reward must count.

short and sharp

--Kevin Chen said
confidence in math ... extremely imp. His turning point

My turning point in chinese compo is similar.

--fuxi: unexpected successes ROTI with boy #peter drucker:
NTUC trips
math sheet on his own
macRitchie
jogging in stadium

--boy has a point: if i don't come home during lunch break, and spends my time in some forgettable way, i won't feel so disappointed.

The fact that boy is not so competitive at A/B/C/D should not be used as a whip to beat myself up for my decisions to spend time coaching him.

Somehow am not celebrating every small improvement in boy. 

need to make him see that dad's bar is not too high.

--do I need counseling, face to face?
tcost too high but now I have time. 

Once or twice is good?

The challenge I'm facing is not minor. I can't pretend to be in NY and leave my son as is.

--new: promise-kept: reward4boy{he improves xx
bring him out to play comp games
bring him to ikea -- less unusable commute tcost

Most of these require my time!

--A very obvious problem in dabao is lack of refresh.
It takes a lot of effort (by parent, tutor or himself) to hit an insight (for a given type of problem). 

He doesn't review it, and will lose 70% of the precious knowledge-gain.

need to get him to refresh

--Q: what are the signs that he is giving up too early, and what are the "opposite" signs that he has tried enough but had no good clue?
A: concentration

Q: what are his signs of fatigue?

Remember I also have fatigue with many practice subjects such as trigo

--new: perseverance: yoga as personal experience
am not good at yoga, but I make a serious effort trying.
I guess relatively few people are like me.

I guess for my son the math practice feels like yoga to some extent??

--new: perseverance #Goh
For non-word problems, I think i should support perseverance.

For word problems, tough choice for me.
I feel encouraging him to solve tougher word problems sounds like 拔苗助长

I kinda see Ms Goh's view. Boy is not trying enough, and relying on other people to do the thinking for him.

Perseverance (willpower) is questionable practice and often fails in many cases. In this case, teacher is very sure and wife also believes it.

My arithmetic drill is doable and requires perseverance; Probably ditto for the easy word problems (some at P3/P4 levels);
Some word problems that require equation .. he has no confidence so perseverance is possibly ineffective.

fatigue and 厌学?

confrontation, strain, losing-cool

key to perseverance -- 温和

compare the P1 spelling experiences -- 3 hours to learn 10 words. I tried teaching him the patterns but completely failed as he was not engaged.

compare the piano perseverance.

邓丽君 was weak in math as a pupil but showed perseverance.

--Q: I want boy to gain from this tough SG math program @@
* word problem-solving techniques? No. Too contrived and not needed in high school or in adult life
* arithmetic proficiency. Note ratios and decimal point shift don't need calculator
* absorbency and perseverance to applying his mind and recall what he learned before?
* not giving up? I doubt he can learn this skill better in the SG system than in U.S.
* self-discipline and perseverance? I doubt it.

--gr8idea: take-up-for-fun
My assumption -- he has lost the basic skills. Pushing him hard will be ineffective.

温和地坚持

On the other hand, he probably needs more perseverance.

Note Take-up-for-fun involves facetime and can create pain (frustration/regret/losing-cool) in me, despite the 'for-fun' slogan.

--gr8idea: reduce workload
From NY, I said daddy would complete some homework for you if too hard. 

His basic arithmetics needs more practice.

I need to rethink. He probably needs more perseverance.

--gr8idea: at most one problem per weekday night
and must start by 9pm

-- my deep (vague) disappointment with my renzi effort was largely due to the worldly, materialistic "progress". 

No progress, then i feel time wasted. That's materialistic and impatience.

--digitize a pool of 10-> 20 common and EASY problem sum questions (word problems) at p2-p4 levels
Ensure he masters the common pattern-recog. I think the patterns are also relevant in the U.S. exams.

Tie big rewards () and small rewards() to his performance on MY questions.

My effort is really on collecting common exam questions.  I hate to do this but I think now....

It's easy to feel love for a younger kid. Younger kids are visibly vulnerable and dependent on us the parents. Parents feel a protective instinct when we see our little kids.

It's harder to maintain the unconditional love and patience for an older kid.

--the media suggests that many parents (mostly mothers) of pre-teens spend half their weekends taking kids to places hoping to expose them to in-situ learning. 

In q3SG phase, I was silly enough to follow these suggestions. I forgot I'm a different parent with my own priorities and limitations. One of the key differences -- 
My spare time is so precious to me. Many of These parents have lots of spare time that they spend on e-entertainments (gaming, internet surfing, online chatting) dining out, socializing. I'm completely different. 

The t-cost of weekend TO me is 5 times higher than the cost TO them. 

Another key difference -- their effort possibly paid off more than in my son.

--new blogpost: 
most of my huge effort to help boy was on the same area -- 上进， 不甘落后，克服困难，持之以恒重复练习， 不怕枯燥。

在这方面， 最有效的帮助是课外活动， 比如钢琴， 不必拿啥名次或证书， 就说他坚持到今天，没有终止，就是不可思议的进步，因为大宝的天性是非常的而不是一般的贪玩，

再比如游泳跑步，他都接受了。没有放弃。

这几项都是家长决定之后，提议坚持。 决定得对。 

除了这个方面， 我也曾帮大宝培养华文兴趣， 减肥， 没啥效果。 

--fuxi: overweight consultation
I think Cigna look at the type of doctor. If we see a dietitian, Cigna will immediately suspect and probably won’t accept.

We can see a pediatric specialist first. Then ask for in-depth tests. If test too expensive, then ask Cigna first.

It’s possible that some experts have seen similar cases and have insight.

--new blogpost: benchmark: growing gap behind those academic kids
I think Lianzhong, Jingheng and many China families that tuition teachers describe are in a different category. 
Their parents are more pushing and the students more talented in terms of absorbency.
The repetitive drills set them apart from the "regular" students. 
The gap in standardized benchmarks is rather large like ... even the simplest problems for me was hard for my sister's classmates.

At college level, you still need repetitive practices but less important.
The regular kids may catch up.

--email to wife/grandparents:
我下半年回新工作后， 会逐渐减少大宝的繁重作业， 因为对孩子学习帮助不大。 

比如数学难题， 做很多还是掌握不了。 也许他的同学能掌握， 那可能是他们能承受反复练习， 大宝没他们的耐力， 或许不应归罪为孩子的错。 

我决心做有智慧和胆识的家长。 数学这科我学的最久， 有自己的体会，观点。 我的决策，基于我的亲身体会和我对大宝的观察， 应该比老师更有根据。 老师的优势， 在于对同年龄学生的了解

--new blog: PSLE is serious
事实上, 美国轻松的学校很多都不是好学校. 美国中学生也要竞争, 也有考试, 也有难题, 也需要坚持和努力, 不学无术的学生大都没有好出路, 只能被淘汰到社会底层.

我曾计划大宝来美, 家住北昂小镇, 能进所谓天才班, 但如果他现在不努力, 恐怕到时候进不去.

考虑正式参加 PSLE, 一家人共同经历这个磨难。 爷爷说也许是件好事， 好像军训. 学习生涯不都是轻松自在的. 压力,磨难有时免不了. 竞争, 是注定免不了的.

在美国, 要上好大学得从 15 岁开始竞争. 也是有压力的.
--
学习是任务, 不喜欢也得接受. 
作业是繁重, 但别的同学能做完, 我们也能.

我们总说大宝不努力。 我没有给他足够的夸奖， 爸爸做的不够。

可以考虑给他一些压力。 这个年岁可以承受一些压力 （包括数学作业）。 但避免厌学。 

我还是提倡温和地坚持。 学习和作业的目标就定为考分。 每天学习最少30分钟， 要他自己认同而不是家长强加的。

完不成学习任务的后果最好是自然的，要不就是他自选的， 而不是家长制造出的后果。 怎么把"后果"和奖励结合呢？

不甘下游
