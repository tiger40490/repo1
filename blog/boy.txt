-- Q to counseller: is it unreasonable to take away the phone for a few months?
30-45 min of gaming time a day for a year.. Before the exam, his mom promised to give him the iPhone8. So now if I seize it he may feel unfair now. When discussing fairness, he reminded me of another reason he feels unfair -- his friends all get to play on the smart phone longer hours than him. The average number of screen hours may be 2.2, but it is a very misleading statistic. Many parents may not realize the harm. Many kids may be more mature and have better self-discipline than my son has.

Handphone is not a nutrition. Perhaps most of his classmates will soon have a phone, but I bet some will NOT. Even if he is the only one without a phone, it's not the same as being the only student without a calculator.

Once a teenager carries a smartphone and mingles with friends, even without a SIM card he would be exposed to many online content and threats. I imagine some friends would shared a mobile hotspot.

Risk of violent backlash? I think he may erupt one day (triggered by some apparent injustice) and possibly hurl something at me or push me as he pushed his mom. I'm actually worried about this risk. He is already stronger than his mom and may become stronger than me.

If I give him the SIM card + phone to set up whatsapp, then he would feel entitled and in the future protest even more when we take it away. 

Smart phone is the opium among many Singapore youth at his age. Alternatively, some may describe it as a pandora's box.

-- alternative to the gaming penalty:
each 30 min on computer = 5 pages or 3 laps (but I would need to bring him there.)
