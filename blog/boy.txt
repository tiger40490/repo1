-- Do I need to make myself more available to boy?
Remember most of the hours when I make myself available to him, I lose private time and therefore it comes at a tcost.
If not careful, the tcost would be rather high, and ROTI would plummet.

I need very high discipline to postpone many open-house tasks to those open-house hours

I feel the bike trips are the best bonding experience.
