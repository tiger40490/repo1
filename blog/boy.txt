--new jolt: U r good enough for me (your dad)
I told a Cigna counselor that I would tell the 11 year old tanbin that "Nobody is perfect or superpowerful. Everyone of us is weak including my dad."

Ted Turner reportedly felt he was never good enough for his father. I want my kids to know they are good enough to be my kids.

eg: when criticizing kids on piano effort, remember their current effort level is already substantial. piano demands a commitment.

Eg: when I criticize boy's unnecessary spend on fancy subway sandwich, I should remember my own "unnecessary" lunch-after-lunch. Note boy's sandwich is relatively healthy by his standard.

--fuxi jolt: if boy asks "can i leave one question to tomorrow?" I need to be a bit careful with my promise. 
It was nice to be decisive but it's actually fine to be hesitant and vague.

--2month: proposal
2M no smartphone gaming
1W no roblox on laptop
$60 from roblox account (to be reduce to $6 since I promised not to fine on this account)
$600 from grandpa account.

--new: listen and remeber his arguments
I said boy's top priority is gaming, but he said he always finishes his homework first before gaming.

Each time he has a valid argument, I really need to listen and respond to his argument without bias or too much emotion. Also I need to acknowledge the limitations in my arguments.
