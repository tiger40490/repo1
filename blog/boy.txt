-- aspire $30 keyboard replacement: who to bear the cost?
give boy the benefit of the doubt

-- need to repeat to boy:
Some people play games but score higher in exams.
Some people smoke, drink alcohol, take drugs, but live longer than me who don't. Reality remains -- those substances are harmful to their health.

--fuxi: I'm STILL trying to make dabao another tanbin
This tendency is very stubborn and subtle.

He has his own strengths, interests, hobbies, preferred way to solving problems and meeting challenges ....

I have my weaknesses, limitations, faults in my making. Over many years of "adjustment" I have come to terms with some of my limitations. Now I need to accept his limitations. 

Look at Genn. As a parent how would I accept her as she is, rather than a very lousy clone of me?

--jolt: I told grandpa that my biggest frustration, 反感 (annoyance), anger ... is boy's laziness, or lack of motivation/effort.

Jolt: His effort level in the final months of P6 was visibly higher than p5 ... P5 was higher than P4.

Jolt: What if he scores well (like top of his class) using even less effort than "this lazy level"? 
I always maintain that "if you are competent then no need to work so hard". This is an elastic yardstick !
Looking into math competence, by Australian standard, boy could be quite competent.

Jolt: If I compare my level of effort to (the idealized image of) Rahul or DeepakCM, or some of those cramming/coding students, do I also deserve punishment? Looks like fundamentally, I'm still relying on benchmark performance to judge boy's effort.

Jolt: If I compare all of the above against the 70-mile runner, then who do Not deserve punishment?

In P6 he used to do his homework slowly till 11pm. I still rated him "lazy" because "inefficient". Waipo saw the same pattern and said congcong was impatient with homework and she might be right. My wife is like that.
I am similar to boy. I drag out my schedule and can be very inefficient even though I spent long hours "at work". But am I lazy at work? If I rate myself as inefficient/slow-pace but diligent, then so is my boy.

--fuxi or new: the worst unacceptable outcome of my son
.. is not benchmark disappointments including career progression
.. is not wellness condition
David's answer -- refusal to talk to parents
Grandpa's answer -- running away from home

My answer is -- effort. If he puts in effort but ends up with those results, I feel I would love him unconditionally. I recall XR's autistic son.

Currently, despite his piano practice, his poor effort everyday is eroding the loving relationship. Unconditional love is under threat. Boy is very sensitive and can probably sense it.

Grandma notices the tension between two forces inside me. She drew this analogy -- imagine your sponse is diagnoised with cancer. You experience the huge pressure to take on the huge legwork and decide on treatment options for the spouse. At the same time, you may also feel the tendency to reject the cancer, and blame the cancer, but the cancel won't go away. Grandma said the 2nd, negative emotion is counterproductive. Yet it is real and common. 
I feel this is a good analogy. The cancer may be incurable. You still have a job to fight it and slow down its progression.

Remember Biden's love for his son, despite his drug problem. I would say he is still a successful father. Indeed a father would be successful if he did his best to stop the progression of such an addiction.

In the same blogpost, there's also a gay son's story. Is that an "effort" problem?

I'm no perfect child. If I have a son like me, is there something I can't accept? Theft!

My son has no aggression, no cruelty, no dishonesty,,,, that's why I find his laziness unacceptable.

--sugg: if boy doesn't shout in a day, reward him with SGD $1 from grandpa, comparable to daily effort. 
Ask boy which reward should be higher.

--new: too much^little homework
These are two risks. Each student has a risk profile. My son is more affected by the too-little-homework risk. He might lack time-management or self-motivation so he tends to lose his time.

Therefore, we can give him more enrichment programs to keep him busy. It would cost something but he has only up to 30 hours a week of spare time, so we won't spend $1k/wk on his enrichments

Many "experts" say that we need to train our children to be independt on studies. However, boy is not the independent type, not in my view

--fuxi
we said that he needs to face the consequences. Now he is facing it but does he care?

--no blog: wife's support is the key factor
Q: what are wife's goals and motivators?
A: health, 成绩，管得太累, hurtful remarks, 体重. 

Q: can you reduce your phone screen time and influence your son to do the same?

--new: David's suggestion: make stories together with him, to illustrate the direct link between current study effort and consequent enjoyment/satisfaction
