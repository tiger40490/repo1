--new: if he reduces his gaming minutes to 30/day but increase his online chat time?

--new:
ask boy (and wife) what things dad can do with boy each week, partly to replace the screen time.
It could be a memorable routine.

I may have a bigger role to play in reducing his screen addiction
--new
lock away the iphone8 until we figure out a way to control its usage. Meanwhile, boy can play games on mom's phone. Mom can also motivate him better.

For school time, the phone will get a SIM card, but we will need to have control policy. By default, no phone.

--new: phone dependency: my criteria
I don't care about other people's definitin of addiction ...
I feel if he spends more than 2H/day looking at the phone screen, it's addiction.

Q: what evidence would convince me that my son is ready to carry a phone
A: when I see that he didn't care about it when it's given to him.

--update: tuition
Many "experts" say that we need to train our children to be independt on studies. However, boy is not the independent type, not in my view

we said that he needs to face the consequences. Now he is facing it but he doesn't care.

--new: u r always performance-ranked
We know that educational resources are never evenly distributed. Everyone wants to get into the better schools. 
(Actually, I feel the most important educational resource is the family including grandparents.)
Singapore process is merit-based whereas other countries often have wealth-based processes. 
When you think of the wealth-based, you confront the exclub-wealth. Actually we are relatively OK in terms of exclub-wealth, but we would need to cut spending on other things such as overseas trips.

Luckily, I have prepared myself for years to deal with and hopefully overcome the waves of cultural shocks related to top schools, stratification, stigma, branding.

As I said years ago, you are always performance-ranked. If you are a musician you may want to ignore the ranking and focus on your music. I happen to have a UChicago and NUS under my belt.

--new: self-care in the face of parenting challenges
the conflict with my son draining my energy. 
self care: I think exercise + lean diet would also help build my self-confidence

I can talk to grandpa or counsellors but more important is wife discussion. 
self care: Also more important than the discussions is blog review and git-blogging.

Sometimes work project can provide work stress, or positive stress, depending on my concentration.
I feel lucky to have the office as my sancturary + short commute.

eg of cognitive self-care: Many neighbors' kids are less academic than ah-boy, some are more academic. I don't compare with them, not excessively. 
Where I do get mad is when I see my son's laziness or poor organization.
--fuxi
ask each kid to tell me one enjoyable time when dad spends time with you that make you feel comfortable?

The time I sacrifice for them may not be effective on the receiving end.

--fuxi or new: the worst unacceptable outcome of my son
.. is not benchmark disappointments including career progression
.. is not wellness condition

My answer is -- effort. If he puts in effort but ends up with those results, I feel I would love him unconditionally. I recall XR's autistic son.

Currently, despite his piano practice, his poor effort everyday is eroding the loving relationship. Unconditional love is under threat. Boy is very sensitive and can probably sense it.

Grandma notices the tension between two forces inside me. She drew this analogy -- imagine your sponse is diagnoised with cancer. You experience the huge pressure to take on the huge legwork and decide on treatment options for the spouse. At the same time, you may also feel the tendency to reject the cancer, and blame the cancer, but the cancel won't go away. Grandma said the 2nd, negative emotion is counterproductive. Yet it is real and common. 
I feel this is a good analogy. The cancer may be incurable. You still have a job to fight it and slow down its progression.

Remember Biden's love for his son, despite his drug problem. I would say he is still a successful father. Indeed a father would be successful if he did his best to stop the progression of such an addiction.

In the same blogpost, there's also a gay son's story. Is that an "effort" problem?

I'm no perfect child. If I have a son like me, is there something I can't accept? Theft!

My son has no aggression, no cruelty, no dishonesty,,,, that's why I find his laziness unacceptable.

--new: parental love and self-esteem
My dad and my mom don't point at someone like LuNuo or TaoYY and say I am less successful in my pay grade. I think they know, at their age and based on their wisdom, the drawbacks of "brank".  My dad doesn't even comment much about my branded degree or my relatively comfortable income. 

Now as I mellow up slowly, I think parental influence is crucial to my self-esteem, self-acceptance. The same will apply to the next generation.

Reality is, those things (brank, degree, big car etc) are exclub/FOMO/kiasu/vainity objects, often unnecessary, and never an essential element (like health, family) of a good life.

After the Kranji Wetland trip, at bedtime I told my son that when I chose his now mother as my bride, I was warned that my kids may not grow up to become academic kids. My son commented that he and his sister were not academic right now. I replied "the two of you may improve in secondary school or college, or after college." My son asked "what if I never become successful", without exploring the criteria of "success". 

I gave an illustration as an answer. "Your classmate XXX may end up earning 10k/M vs 2k/M in your case but you still can have a happy life". I asked him to work out 10k is 5 times higher than 2k.

I hope this goes down as a memorable conversation. Weeks before this conversation, I asked my son to think about excellence.

I want him to strive for excellence. He is definitely able to achieve some excellence in some domain, but even if a guy didn't find that domain and didn't achieve excellence, the process of striving and the effort, would define him. I think there are some examples, but these are probably the minority. The majority of guys who strive for excellence would achieve it somewhere. 

Excellence means exceeding the current personal limits and parents', colleagues' or other individuals' expectation of us. Traditionally, excellence also means reaching heights defined by external standards but i don't emphasize that meaning as it is often a by-product of accumulation. I feel it's best to focus on personal excellence.

Just don't settle for mediocrity.

After I told Grandpa about the bedtime conversation, he delivered a shocking reminder that income should NOT be a criteria for a blessed life (幸福). He said something similar to Raymond's words "What if you earn the typical [1] Singaporean family's income? Can't you live a good life in Singapore?" 

[1] I would use the median as a criteria. If your family income is above the median, then you are better than 50% of the Singapore families.

This gives me another motivation for healthy longevity -- if my son's income is below average, then I want to hang around to help him. 

-- new: smartphone can be acceptable for boy #OPL
Pearleen Ong on 19 Oct suggested that smartphone is widely considered a semi-necessity, so it's probably not necessary to delay the handover

I said some S1 students do not have a smartphone. She said these students may feel left out, perhaps due to poverty.

.. at some age, boy may save up and buy a smartphone himself. This is more likely to happen if there's insufficient agreement among the 3 of us.

The open communications channel is priceless. I feel it's built on trust.

.. after 12 Nov don't say yes/no.
give him iPhone8, under mom supervision. agreement. execution
.. holiday
s1 literature subject textbook... story books
CDAC activities
.. 1 Jan let him carry the phone with tracker
try for 2 weeks

find some tracker apps.

-- Q to counseller: is it unreasonable to take away the phone for a few months?
30-45 min of gaming time a day for a year.. Before the exam, his mom promised to give him the iPhone8. So now if I seize it he may feel unfair now. When discussing fairness, he reminded me of another reason he feels unfair -- his friends all get to play on the smart phone longer hours than him. The average number of screen hours may be 2.2, but it is a very misleading statistic. Many parents may not realize the harm. Many kids may be more mature and have better self-discipline than my son has.

Handphone is not a nutrition. Perhaps most of his classmates will soon have a phone, but I bet some will NOT. Even if he is the only one without a phone, it's not the same as being the only student without a calculator.

Once a teenager carries a smartphone and mingles with friends, even without a SIM card he would be exposed to many online content and threats. I imagine some friends would shared a mobile hotspot.

Risk of violent backlash? I think he may erupt one day (triggered by some apparent injustice) and possibly hurl something at me or push me as he pushed his mom. I'm actually worried about this risk. He is already stronger than his mom and may become stronger than me.

If I give him the SIM card + phone to set up whatsapp, then he would feel entitled and in the future protest even more when we take it away. 

Smart phone is the opium among many Singapore youth at his age. Alternatively, some may describe it as a pandora's box.
