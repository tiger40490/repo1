-- kenneth's story
HCI -> St Andrew's JC -> NTU Sociology acceptance, but went to NorthEastern "business" degree -> UPenn special Master's for non-IT graduates.

NorthEastern has a co-op program... (update blogpost on Berea)

Kenneth felt poly would give you more personal time to explore in different directions, and help you figure out what you want to do 

Kenneth felt JC is too competitive and wouldn't bruild a broad foundation as promised. In fact, JC curriculum is deeper not broader than G7-10.

I think the huge effort (sacrifice) that each puts into the 2Y may not be worthwhile, depending on the individual.

His sister is in U-Mel's foundation program (1Y), where she could get a teaser of the various college courses. After a year, she could enroll as college freshman, a year before her cohort in JC.
There's a risk if she doesn't qualify for UMel after the program. Kenneth said worst case she may need to come back to JC. I said such a delay is normal in real life, and her 1Y would not be spent in timezone.

-- math practice: offer boy random rewards like "spend $10 on a data package"
-- Most (50%+) students (adults too) are inefficient on multiple fronts
* too many gaming hours
* slow start in daily homework
* late sleep, perhaps on weekends
* getting up late
* no rest on commute. No reading either
* not paying attention and missing the stops
* sleepy in class, unable to follow some topics
* too busy to have rest and exercise. low energy

In many schools, there is sufficient buffer for these inefficient students to survive, but how about your school. I think a boarding school is a good training ground.

The key is chipaway at efficiency improvement and self-discipline on a few identified fronts. Aim to achieve above-average efficiency in at least some fronts.

--in benchmark exams, I tend to exaggerate the effect of effort. Could be internal locus of control.
benchmark exam is an artificial world. very few surprises, compared to the natural world. Therefore, luck, relationships, ... are much less important.

-- US GPA system combines 4 years of exams vs a one-time exam for PSLE, gaokao or A-levels.

ROI -- reward for good behavior

-- fuxi: Raymond's boys are in a lower position
The older boy has now failed to pass 3 subjects and can only pass science at end of P5. Geometry is one weakness.

The mother didn't help out with Chinese, but grandma said we should not blame the mother.

-- tanko reminds boy: if you don't pass IPPT, you will be requried to attend extra fitness training for months or years -- tough, punishing. Even after discharge, you need to come back every Saturday.

-- one specific small tip from wq.l: write down the failed exam questions and review them
Would need mother's buy-in

A simple technique, easy to implement iFF he is willing, motivated.

--fuxi: Once the weak student starts to score, his confidence could improve. His fear/interest sentiment will improve. 
Necessary condition is the desire to improve his life. Right now he doesn't care that much.
In a sense, the score serves as a reward, a target, a constant feedback.

-- need to repeat to boy:
Some people play games but somehow score higher in exams.
Some people smoke, drink alcohol, take drugs, but live longer than me who don't. Reality remains -- those substances are harmful to their health.

--sugg: if boy doesn't shout on a weekday when dad is home, reward him with SGD $1 from grandpa, comparable to daily effort. 
Ask boy which reward should be higher.
