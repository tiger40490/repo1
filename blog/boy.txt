my discussion with math tutor was overly negative about my son. She has her concerns, but she didn't have the optimism and confidence based on grandpa's wisdom -- standardized benchmark has limitations.

strength -- piano absorbency
strength -- able to complete heavy homework
strength -- able to complete some of the homework from tuition

--no blog:
Hougang trip with boy in 2012 (and similar trips) were poor bargains -- high tcost no pleasure no benefit, like wasting money on a distasteful and high-calorie meal
Later trips to stadium/pool/climbing were better

Now I know better how I want to spend my precious time with boy -- exercise, study, have real fun not necessarily spending money
--new blog: some extra math problems everyday
Some parents advocate giving a few math problems a day to a kid.

I feel some kids can embrace such repetitive practices -- Ma Liang, HuKun, Siddesh... 
My son can't despite my consistent effort over the years.

In fact, my son is overloaded with homework

Forcing my son to do even a minute of any repetitive practice is against the "natual consequence" principle. 
The ensuing reward/punishment feels completely homemade and unnatural consequence. 
I believe my son will NOT embrace it.
Probably a serious blocker in the fundamental motivation/feedback loop.

How about piano and swimming? Repetive practice that requires absorbency. 
My son embraced the challenges with a moderate level of absorbency. 
I think he is not completely unwilling to take on repetitive practices. 
Fundamentally, his absorbency is lower than his peers.

Remember the green zone? His piano practice can go beyond the green zone. Grandma even suggested that he uses piano as a break from homework. He got the idea but i don't know if he can do it.

--new blogpost: benchmark: growing gap behind those academic kids
I think Lianzhong, Jingheng and many China families that tuition teachers describe are in a different category. 
Their parents are more pushing and the students more talented in terms of absorbency.
The repetitive drills set them apart from the "regular" students. 
The gap in standardized benchmarks is rather large like ... even the simplest problems for me was hard for my sister's classmates.

At uni level, you still need repetitive practices but less important.
The regular kids may catch up.

我下半年回新工作后， 会逐渐减少大宝的繁重作业， 因为对孩子学习帮助不大。 

比如数学难题， 做很多还是掌握不了。 也许他的同学能掌握， 那可能是他们能承受反复练习， 大宝没他们的耐力， 或许不应归罪为孩子的错。 

我决心做有智慧和胆识的家长。 数学这科我学的最久， 有自己的体会，观点。 我的决策，基于我的亲身体会和我对大宝的观察， 应该比老师更有根据。 老师的优势， 在于对同年龄学生的了解

--new blog: PSLE is serious
需要改变大宝几年来的观念 , 好像不必在乎 PSLE, 反正到美国就轻松了.

事实上, 美国轻松的学校很多都不是好学校. 美国中学生也要竞争, 也有考试, 也有难题, 也需要坚持和努力, 不学无术的学生大都没有好出路, 只能被淘汰到社会底层.

我曾计划大宝来美, 家住北昂小镇, 能进所谓天才班, 但如果他现在不努力, 恐怕到时候进不去.

考虑正式参加 PSLE, 一家人共同经历这个磨难。 爷爷说也许是件好事， 好像军训. 学习生涯不都是轻松自在的. 压力,磨难有时免不了. 竞争, 是注定免不了的.

在美国, 要上好大学得从 15 岁开始竞争. 也是有压力的.

学习是任务, 不喜欢也得接受. 
作业是繁重, 但别的同学能做完, 我们也能.
