-- fuxi: Q: boy deserves a reward after his 2023 finals?
A: I think he would not have deserved such a special reward if he had fared well like As and Bs.

What form of reward, given his effort going to the exam? He didn't give up as much as in WA3
Reduce his pending penalty? Will he feel the reward? 

Cash reward? $500?

-- U.S. high schools might be too relaxed for my son, too dependent on individual initiative as if these students are adults.
In the same vein, XMS's philosophy might be too dependent on the same.
I feel my son needs more strict dicipline and more heavy homework. Perhaps ITE has some advantage over poly.

sugg: read grandp's memoir to boy

Outing with boy is time well spent. Any exercise is a bonus.

Someone even recommended co-play and co-watch on his phone.
-- new preFGO #JiaHui 
first we apply for screening, knowing there would be a record at MSF.

If no behavior issues uncovered, we would fail the screening and be referred to FSC.

If we pass screening, there will be 6M of compulsory weekly counselling for all 3 family members. Truancy will be recorded.

After counselling/therapy, parents can decide to proceed to Youth Court.

If we proceed to court, and court grants FGO, and there is any truancy record, boy will be escorted to SBH for 1 month, while the assigned officer completes the initial set-up.

There will be a record of the SBH "jail" sentence.

-- what if he underperforms himself in OLE?
Ms Chia -- just deal with it at that time.
Senior CGC doctor -- Let him fail.

ask each kid to tell me one enjoyable time when dad spends time with you that make you feel comfortable?

boy .. cycling? Tram?
meimei .. singing

The time I sacrifice for them may not be effective on the receiving end.

-- fuxi: Most (50%+) students (adults too) are inefficient on multiple fronts
* too many gaming hours
* slow start in daily homework
* late sleep, perhaps on weekends
* getting up late
* no rest on commute. No reading either
** not paying attention and missing the stops
* sleepy in class, unable to follow some topics
* too busy to have rest and exercise. low energy

In many schools, there is sufficient buffer for these inefficient students to survive, but how about your school. I think a boarding school is a good training ground.

The key is chipaway at efficiency improvement and self-discipline on a few identified fronts. Aim to achieve above-average efficiency in at least some fronts.

--new: worst unacceptable outcome@boy
.. is not benchmark disappointments including career progression
.. is not wellness condition including poor sleep
EAP counseller David's answer -- refusal to talk to parents
Grandpa's answer -- running away from home

My answer is -- effort. If he puts in effort but ends up with those results, I feel I would love him unconditionally. I recall XR's autistic son.

Teresa Teng was not a strong math student (perhaps like my daughter) but worked hard at every subject.

Currently, despite his piano practice, his poor effort everyday is eroding the bond. Unconditional love is under threat. Boy is very sensitive and can probably sense it.

Grandma notices the tension between two forces inside me. She drew this analogy -- imagine your sponse is diagnoised with cancer. You experience the huge pressure to take on the huge legwork and decide on treatment options for the spouse. At the same time, you may also feel the tendency to reject the cancer, and blame the cancer, but the cancer won't go away. Grandma said the 2nd, negative emotion is counterproductive. Yet it is real and common. 
I feel grandma gave a good analogy. The cancer may be incurable. You still have a job to fight it and slow down its progression.

Remember Biden's love for his son, despite the son's drug problem. I would say Biden is still a successful father. Indeed a father would be successful if he did his best to stop the progression of such an addiction.

In the same blogpost about Biden, there's also a gay son's story. Is that an "effort" problem?

I'm no perfect child myself. If I have a son like me, is there something I can't accept? Theft!

My son has no aggression, no cruelty, no dishonesty,,,, that's why I find his laziness unacceptable.

-- new: unequal access to edu resources 
In U.S. I believe the rich and the well-educated has better access to edu resources, esp. top schools.

My focus in this bpost is Singaproe, but I would make comparisons to U.S. or China.

Social mobility? Not my initial focus in this bpost. My critics may point out various evidence of social mobility in terms of education, but I think statistics would prove my point.

In Singapore, those China families that I hear about.. invariably have white-collar parents educated in China. Using the family resources [mostly the parents and their better genes], these China families often outcompete local students and get into top schools i.e. local edu resources. 

The public edu resources are concentrated in some top schools. MOE welcome those top China students as they improve the standard in local schools.

The private edu resources are price-driven. International schools, tuition centers are the embodiment.

Some rich families have a stay-home parent to help the kids... a Resource!

I discussed some of it with Jialing.Zheng. Don't remember what he said. I said it's unfair of me to compare my son with those China families' kids.

-- fuxi: training fee is a doubly-edged sword
It can create pains in parents' rmSelf. High fees can lead to hightened conflicts between parents and kids.

On the other hand, it could induce commitment, provided the kid is "ready".

I think Dr Colin Ong see the same sword, when it comes to the treatment fees.

-- new private: Ken See's inspirational story
HCI -> St Andrew's JC -> NTU Sociology acceptance, but went to NorthEastern "business" degree -> UPenn special Master's for non-IT graduates.

Among the UPen program past graduates, about 1/3 become SWEs, about 1/3 found jobs combining IT with their previous professions. A small minority chose theoretical PhD programs.

NorthEastern has a co-op program... See the long email (update blogpost on Berea)

Kenneth felt poly would give you more *personal time* to explore in different directions, and help you figure out what you want to do.

Kenneth felt JC is too competitive and wouldn't build a broad foundation as promised. In fact, JC curriculum is deeper not broader than Grade 7-10.

I think the huge effort (sacrifice) that each puts into the 2Y may not be worthwhile, depending on the individual.

His sister is in U-Mel's foundation program (1Y), where she could get a teaser of the various college courses. After a year, she could enroll as college freshman, a year earlier than her cohort in JC.
There's a risk if she doesn't qualify for UMel after the program. Kenneth said worst case she may need to come back to JC. I said such a delay is normal in real life, and her 1Y would not be spent in Timezone.
