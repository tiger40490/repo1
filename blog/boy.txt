U.S. edu (and parenting) culture -- more encouragement, more confidence building, less "rule-abiding" as I experienced first-hand in Singapore system.

--fuxi: counselling :
For at least a few weeks, focus on self-care (incl. sleep). As to Parenting and control -- revisit in late May. Am not in a position to control boy. Am weak.

set ground rules for entire family to follow such as what time I need to sleep. I feel these need to be realistic.

When ah-boy misbehaves, disengage. Let Go. Avoid confrontation. Act as if I'm in NY.

Consider white noise apps like Tide to block out the screaming. Use earphone if needed.

高压 discipline ..

Observe what the kid wants and fulfill his needs.

keep the communication open as they go through adolescence. 

Accept some variations in individual personalities.

Curiosity is a good thing in a kid.

my anger towards boy is rather impulsive (irrational). I tend to attribute "all my pains" to this boy, when the real reason is my own reaction.

Remember DeepakG's words? 

The biggest risk is harm to him (also to myself), and to our bond. In a way, I need to always keep that risk in mind.

anger mgmt !

--I feel I need to focus more on motivation than benchmark 
The fixation on academic relative ranking is painful and frustrating. 
It’s always relative to fellow students. I have poor control over the performance of fellow students.

Each kid has a different needs. My son may need more time to wind down before he starts his homework.

Teenagers may take a few years to open up to parents... I want to have time for them when they open up. Less stressful job, shorter commute, ,,,

Some strong students suffer when they move to a top school and find themselves at the bottom. I think I had that experience in my physics Olympiad training camp at Grade 10.

--I predicted that remote learning would play to boy's advantage
Our advantage -- wife not working + my flexible hours.
Our advantage -- multiple devices
Our advantage -- boy is expert at devices
Our disadvantage in traditional setting -- boy dislikes paper-based learning. A screen is like a big toy.

Just like GM assumes everyone hates heat, I have a bias against online video classes, but if boy can benefit then there are many online learning materials

--dietitian's rules are too strict to be realistic
absolutely no McDonald's?
