-- new: smartphone can be acceptable for boy #OPL
Pearleen Ong on 19 Oct suggested that smartphone is widely considered a semi-necessity, so it's probably not necessary to delay the handover

I said some S1 students do not have a smartphone. She said these students may feel left out, perhaps due to poverty.

-- at some age, boy may save up and buy a smartphone himself. This is more likely to happen if there's insufficient agreement among the 3 of us.

The open communications channel is priceless. I feel it's built on trust.

-- Q to counseller: is it unreasonable to take away the phone for a few months?
30-45 min of gaming time a day for a year.. Before the exam, his mom promised to give him the iPhone8. So now if I seize it he may feel unfair now. When discussing fairness, he reminded me of another reason he feels unfair -- his friends all get to play on the smart phone longer hours than him. The average number of screen hours may be 2.2, but it is a very misleading statistic. Many parents may not realize the harm. Many kids may be more mature and have better self-discipline than my son has.

Handphone is not a nutrition. Perhaps most of his classmates will soon have a phone, but I bet some will NOT. Even if he is the only one without a phone, it's not the same as being the only student without a calculator.

Once a teenager carries a smartphone and mingles with friends, even without a SIM card he would be exposed to many online content and threats. I imagine some friends would shared a mobile hotspot.

Risk of violent backlash? I think he may erupt one day (triggered by some apparent injustice) and possibly hurl something at me or push me as he pushed his mom. I'm actually worried about this risk. He is already stronger than his mom and may become stronger than me.

If I give him the SIM card + phone to set up whatsapp, then he would feel entitled and in the future protest even more when we take it away. 

Smart phone is the opium among many Singapore youth at his age. Alternatively, some may describe it as a pandora's box.

psle is stressful time for parents and child. You have to face the selection process (similar in other countries). 

We know that educational resources are never evenly distributed. Everyone wants to get into the better schools. 
(Actually, I feel the most important educational resource is the family including grandparents.)
Singapore process is merit-based whereas other countries often have wealth-based processes. 
When you think of the wealth-based, you confront the exclub-wealth. Actually we are relatively OK in terms of exclub-wealth, but we would need to cut spending on other things such as overseas trips.

Luckily, I have prepared myself for years to deal with and hopefully overcome the waves of cultural shocks related to top schools, stratification, stigma, branding.

As I said years ago, you are always assessed, performance-ranked. If you are a musician you may want to ignore the ranking and focus on your music. I happen to have a UChicago and NUS under my belt.

--self-care in the face of parenting challenges
the conflict with my son draining my energy. 
self care: I think exercise + lean diet would also help build my self-confidence

I can talk to grandpa or counsellors but more important is wife discussion. 

self care: Also more important than the discussions is blog review and git-blogging.

Sometimes work project can provide work stress, or positive stress, depending on my concentration.

I feel lucky to have the office as my sancturary + short commute.

-- alternative to the gaming penalty:
each 30 min on computer = 5 pages or 3 laps (but I would need to bring him there.)

-- David's suggestion: make stories together with him, to illustrate the direct link between current study effort and consequent enjoyment/satisfaction
