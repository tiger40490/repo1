-- Do I need to make myself more available to boy?
If not careful, the tcost would be rather high, and ROTI would plummet

I feel the bike trips are the best bonding experience.

-- I spent money on robux to reduce his gaming time, but is it working?
Need a critical, open discussion with boy.

If not "reducing" then I feel this is like timezone -- spending money to give him the reward that he really appreciates.

--fuxi: counsellor chat on meimei phone addiction
family outing to reduce screen addiction. Cycling with dad is similar. watching a movie at home together could be counted as family time, and perhaps much better than "phone screen time".

try to reduce the (angry) outburst to a smaller flow. 

My discipline on meimei is looser than ah-boy, but it could be a good thing, as my strict confrontational stance /breeds/ anger. Anger breeds loss of control.

I tend to feel that the common advice and strategies won't help, but look at this case.

Imagine a Chinese guy speaking broken English in Singapore or New York. Dismissed and discounted by everyone, but when it comes to driving, he is very skillful, because .... because driving doesn't require Enlgish.

Another example is math, which doesn't require English skill. 

My son is not strong in theoretical domains (similar to broken English), but he may prove his GTD abilities on a real job. Those who discount him would be surprise, perhaps upset.
