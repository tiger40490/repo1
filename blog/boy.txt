--I predicted that remote learning would play to boy's advantage
Our advantage -- wife not working + my flexible hours.

-- boy's 30min/day gaming time is relatively short and better than many kids

--I have a bias against online video classes, but if boy can benefit then there are many online learning materials

What would be a real sabotage of daddy's coaching effort? How about passive resistance?
How would a dicerning parent decide when to give up?

If not dicerning enough, then I would hit bitter contention, painful disappointment, wheel-spinning, self-hate, regretable ROTI, losing my cool

--covid19: by default, boy is losing time for swim, basketball, and spend more time .. doing nothing. 
How can we improve his time utilization?

Luckily, he is reading books.

--
clarify with boy -- his eng is better than 95% of China students; his science is probably better than 60% of China students; his math is better than the some rural China students 

--new: 'losing my cool' and 'facetime' are valuable descriptors to help me recognize, verbalize. They are instrumental to my therapeutic blogging.

--fuxi: anger mgmt at face time
therapeutic blogging really helps.

--if boy asks "can i leave one question to tomorrow?" I need to be a bit careful with my promise. 
It was nice to be decisive but it's actually fine to be hesitant and vague.

--fuxi: boy enjoys board game without being very good. but it is a better past time than screens
I was never good at any board game, 

--fuxi: with science, his foundation is sound, much better than his math abstract thinking.
However, he is not hungry for the marks. Not focused on the marks.
Therefore, his more mature classmates have a clear advantage over him.

--fuxi: should we remind him of the secondary school he picked?
Is he feeling any motivation? Perhaps non-zero
I need to be extremely careful not to turn it into negative motivation or ridicule

--fuxi: 
Q: $25 basketball paid too much?

The basketball buying experience is probably one of the defining experiences.
The main (perhaps implicit) message I sent across is -- If you are going to 喜新厌旧, then we can only spend a small amount. If you are going to keep this basketball for a long time, then we can spend a little more. 
I think he got the message, even though he may not use it frquently.
My estimate of that "frequency" is emotionally biased and unreliable.
Therefore, my answr to Q1 is also biased.

I too believe the first few versions of anything we buy are only for trying out. However in this case, we bought three previous versions -- way too high.

--fuxi: earlier I told boy he had a parachute -- after PSLE he would go to U.S.
Now he has to face the harsh reality that the parachute is lost.

--fuxi: lost my cool. In hind sight, I did notice it and briefly considered leaving the scene but I felt that would be a defeat of a parent by a child!

Actually boy had already conceded once and agreed to listen to me showing him my method, but in the end he was "punished" as a result.... and feeling cheated.

I did raise my voice many times,,, a sign of losing my cool.

For a moment, I wanted to hit him or smash something (better than a smack),,, a sign of losing my cool.

Self-awareness is my key strength. Compared to other guys, I am better able to step out of myself and observe the person.

I need to recognize my limitation as a father and coach. One of the biggest limitations is losing my cool.
If and when I acknowledge my limitation, I should get help.

When hitting boy, it's important to have another parent present. Boy and I were both lucky that grandparents were around, to help maintain a balance, which is very much needed when I lose my cool but continue to engage in confrontational facetime.

Word problems with fractions are the toughest for boy. He would need to apply his mind and persevere

--new: ipad2
too old to install whatsapp
builtin speaker: s$45 replacement
16GB. Available space too small to install some big games.

--fuxi:
As a student, I found certain subjects completely boring and useless -- politics, Chinese, biology

Most of my classmates felt the same about history, and trigo

So we were not motivated to memorize or practice.

--fuxi: overweight consultation
I think Cigna look at the type of doctor. If we see a dietitian, Cigna will immediately suspect and probably won’t accept.

We can see a pediatric specialist first. Then ask for in-depth tests. If test too expensive, then ask Cigna first.

It’s possible that some experts have seen similar cases and have insight.

--fuxi: boy experiences a lot of internal resistance to math practice esp pattern recog in wordy problems
I also experience the same with chin-up, stretching and coding drill

If no choice due to strict rule from dad, then not so much suffering and resistance.

Self-discipline without external help is harder.
