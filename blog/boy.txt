--new: smashing "safe" objects is a slippery slope.
I have damaged a toy monkey.
I have smashed a red-bean bakery.
I have damanged iPhone8 screen.

It's important to remember the collateral damages, or they could be sacrificed for nothing.
-- need to repeat to boy:
Some people play games but score higher.
Some people smoke, drink alcohol, take drugs, but live longer than me who don't. Reality remains -- those substances are harmful to their health.

--jolt: I told grandpa that my biggest frustration, 反感 (annoyance), anger ... is boy's laziness, or lack of motivation/effort.

Jolt: His effort level in the final months of P6 was visibly higher than p5 ... P5 was higher than P4.

Jolt: What if he scores well (like top of his class) using even less effort than "this lazy level"? 
I always maintain that "if you are competent then no need to work so hard". This is an elastic yardstick !
Looking into math competence, by Australian standard, boy could be quite competent.

Jolt: If I compare my level of effort to (the idealized image of) Rahul or DeepakCM, or some of those cramming/coding students, do I also deserve punishment? Looks like fundamentally, I'm still relying on benchmark performance to judge boy's effort.

Jolt: If I compare all of the above against the 70-mile runner, then who do Not deserve punishment?

In P6 he used to do his homework slowly till 11pm. I still rated him "lazy" because "inefficient". Waipo saw the same pattern and said congcong was impatient with homework and she might be right. My wife is like that.
I am similar to boy. I drag out my schedule and can be very inefficient even though I spent long hours "at work". But am I lazy at work? If I rate myself as inefficient/slow-pace but diligent, then so is my boy.

--fuxi or new: the worst unacceptable outcome of my son
.. is not benchmark disappointments including career progression
.. is not wellness condition

My answer is -- effort. If he puts in effort but ends up with those results, I feel I would love him unconditionally. I recall XR's autistic son.

Currently, despite his piano practice, his poor effort everyday is eroding the loving relationship. Unconditional love is under threat. Boy is very sensitive and can probably sense it.

Grandma notices the tension between two forces inside me. She drew this analogy -- imagine your sponse is diagnoised with cancer. You experience the huge pressure to take on the huge legwork and decide on treatment options for the spouse. At the same time, you may also feel the tendency to reject the cancer, and blame the cancer, but the cancel won't go away. Grandma said the 2nd, negative emotion is counterproductive. Yet it is real and common. 
I feel this is a good analogy. The cancer may be incurable. You still have a job to fight it and slow down its progression.

Remember Biden's love for his son, despite his drug problem. I would say he is still a successful father. Indeed a father would be successful if he did his best to stop the progression of such an addiction.

In the same blogpost, there's also a gay son's story. Is that an "effort" problem?

I'm no perfect child. If I have a son like me, is there something I can't accept? Theft!

My son has no aggression, no cruelty, no dishonesty,,,, that's why I find his laziness unacceptable.

--sugg: if boy doesn't shout in a day, reward him with SGD $1 from grandpa, comparable to daily effort. 
Ask boy which reward should be higher.

--fuxi: many primary school parents say "most students have similar IQ" but what's their sample? What's their criteria for 2 students being "similar"?
If you use an objective benchmark, then how many questions are easy and how many are advanced.

So statistically, such a statement is so extremely vague that it's nothing more than a sentiment.

--remind boy to do the minimum daily routine next week
--fuxi: coding camp
if I were to engage him for 3 hours x 5, I would likely stretch out to a year as it is low priority and so many other events and conflicts would interfere.

--new: too much^little homework
These are two risks. Each student has a risk profile. My son is more affected by the too-little-homework risk. He lacks time-management or self-motivation so he tends to lose his time.

Therefore, we can give him more enrichment programs to keep him busy. It would cost something but he has only up to 30 hours a week of spare time, so we won't spend $1k/wk on his enrichments

Many "experts" say that we need to train our children to be independt on studies. However, boy is not the independent type, not in my view

--fuxi
we said that he needs to face the consequences. Now he is facing it but does he care?

--new untitled: edu resource uneven distribution.
We know that educational resources are never evenly distributed. Everyone wants to get into the better schools. 
(Actually, I feel the most important education resource is the family including grandparents.)
Singapore's resource "allocation" is merit-based whereas other countries often have wealth-based allocation. 
When you think of the wealth-based, you confront the exclub-wealth. Actually we are relatively OK in terms of exclub-wealth, but we would need to cut spending on other things such as overseas trips.

Luckily, I have prepared myself for years to deal with and hopefully overcome the waves of cultural shocks related to top schools, stratification, stigma, branding.

In merit-based on wealth-based systems, you are always performance-ranked, as I said years ago. If you are a musician you may want to ignore the ranking and focus on your music. 
I happen to have a UChicago and NUS under my belt.

--fuxi
ask each kid to tell me one enjoyable time when dad spends time with you that make you feel comfortable?

The time I sacrifice for them may not be effective on the receiving end.

--new: no good title: parental love and self-esteem
My dad and my mom don't point at someone like LuNuo or TaoYY and say I am less successful in my brank. I think they know, at their age and based on their wisdom, the drawbacks of "brank".  My dad doesn't even comment much about my branded degree or my relatively comfortable income. 

Now as I mellow up slowly, I think parental influence is crucial to my self-esteem, self-acceptance. The same will apply to the next generation.

Reality is, those things (brank, degree, big car etc) are exclub/FOMO/kiasu/vainity objects, often unnecessary, and never an essential element (like health, family) of a good life.

After the Kranji Wetland trip, at bedtime I told my son that when I chose his now mother as my bride, I was warned that my kids may not grow up to become academic kids. My son commented that he and his sister were not academic right now. I replied "the two of you may improve in secondary school or college, or after college." My son asked "what if I never become successful", without exploring the criteria of "success". 

I gave an illustration as an answer. "Your classmate XXX may end up earning 10k/M vs 2k/M in your case but you still can have a happy life". I asked him to work out 10k is 5 times higher than 2k.

I hope this goes down as a memorable conversation. Weeks before this conversation, I asked my son to think about excellence.

I want him to strive for excellence. He is definitely able to achieve some excellence in some domain, but even if a guy didn't find that domain and didn't achieve excellence, the process of striving and the effort, would define him. I think there are some examples, but these are probably the minority. The majority of guys who strive for excellence would achieve it somewhere. 

Excellence means exceeding the current personal limits and parents', colleagues' or other individuals' expectation of us. Traditionally, excellence also means reaching heights defined by external standards but i don't emphasize that meaning as it is often a by-product of accumulation. I feel it's best to focus on personal excellence.

Just don't settle for mediocrity.

After I told Grandpa about the bedtime conversation, he delivered a shocking reminder that income should NOT be a criteria for a blessed life (幸福). He said something similar to Raymond's words "What if you earn the typical [1] Singaporean family's income? Can't you live a good life in Singapore?" 

[1] I would use the median as a criteria. If your family income is above the median, then you are better than 50% of the Singapore families.

This gives me another motivation for healthy longevity -- if my son's income is below average, then I want to hang around to help him. 

--no blog: wife's support is the key factor
Q: what are wife's goals and motivators?
A: health, 成绩，管得太累, hurtful remarks, 体重. 

Q: can you reduce your phone screen time and influence your son to do the same?
