--jolt:
Without the bmark crisis, 
I wouldn't see his arithmetic weakness due to years of neglect
I wouldn't say he is so lazy. Perhaps he is more motivated than many kids of another country.
I wouldn't see his poor clarity of thinking and pattern recognition
I wouldn't feel so negative about his tech career

--new or fuxi: 
boy's math drill need to differentiate between the more practical skills vs contrived questions

cubic volume
time
average
chart

--why i prefer devising my problem rather than taking a book
If I pick one question from a P5 book, the 
other 9 questions on the same page create such negative pressure, because they are not easy for my son.

--A very obvious problem in dabao is lack of refresh.
It takes a lot of effort (by parent, tutor or himself) to hit an insight (for a given type of problem). 

He doesn't review it, and will lose 70% of the precious knowledge-gain.

--I used to have a buddy type relationship with boy.. Now is more like coach.
What's the key factor? Something in my attitude.

I can learn his language, learn his favorite artists

--Q: what are the signs that he is giving up too early, and what are the "opposite" signs that he has tried enough but had no good clue?

Q: what are his signs of fatigue?

Remember I also have fatigue with many practice subjects such as trigo

--new: sustained focus #absorbency
This is hard for me as well. 

--new: perseverance: yoga as personal experience
am not good at yoga, but I make a serious effort trying.
I guess relatively few people are like me.

I guess for my son the math practice feels like yoga to some extent??

--new: perseverance #Goh
For non-word problems, I think i should support perseverance.

For word problems, tough choice for me.
I feel encouraging him to solve tougher word problems sounds like 拔苗助长

I kinda see Ms Goh's view. Boy is not trying enough, and relying on other people to do the thinking for him.

Perseverance (willpower) is questionable practice and often fails in many cases. In this case, teacher is very sure and wife also believes it.

fatigue and 厌学?

confrontation, strain, losing-cool

key to perseverance -- 温和

compare the P1 spelling experiences -- 3 hours to learn 10 words. I tried teaching him the patterns but completely failed as he was not engaged.

compare the piano perseverance.

邓丽君 was weak in math as a pupil but showed perseverance.

--jolt
I decided in NY to come home and reduce boy's math workload -- saturation, eroding confidence/interest..
The "perseverance" slogan is directly against it.

--jolt: when i feel boy will fail his exams, I need to remember tutor's words -- he is much better than many slow, rebellious kids, so he will pass for sure, despite his weaknesses in arithmetic, apply-his-mind, carelessness etc

I criticized Shanyou for his "shame" about his son, but what about my feeling of inferiority about my son's math?

--jolt: I realized long ago that the Chinese composition requirement is unrealistic for many kids. 
Too much pressure. 

Now I feel the math word problems are highly contrived. Equation is the right method but not taught. Fuck the system!

The SG quantity of practice is possibly too much at high school level, even for a China high school student in 1991.
Will the U.S. quantity be more effective more appropriate for my son?

Over 2 years, I realized that my Singapore classmates mostly showed speed but shallow understanding in math and physics. 

I feel IF my son shows enough understanding, but insufficient speed, I should avoid applying the SG exam standard.

If in another country the quantity/speed is 50% lower, he may be doing just fine. Perhaps at P3 he was at that position.
So is he too slow at arithmetics? My assessment is, tragically, influenced by the SG exam system.
I want to say fuck the SG exam system. Fuck the contrived word problems.
If I spend some time analyzing quantity/speed (Not complexity) in U.S. P5 math exams (common standard?), I will get some idea what's "normal" in another system.

Now I may need the inner strength to withstand the pressure from the SG school system. The streaming, the "caste", the PSLE 3-digit scores, 

--Q: I want boy to gain from this tough SG math program @@
* word problem-solving techniques? No. Too contrived and not needed in high school
* arithmetic proficiency. Note ratios and decimal point shift don't need calculator
* absorbency and perseverance to applying his mind and recall what he learned before?
* not giving up? I doubt he can learn this skill better in the SG system than in U.S.
* self-discipline and perseverance? I doubt it.

--gr8idea: take-up-for-fun
My assumption -- he has lost the basic skills. Pushing him hard will be ineffective.

温和地坚持

On the other hand, he probably needs more perseverance.

Note Take-up-for-fun involves facetime and can create pain (frustration/regret/losing-cool) in me, despite the 'for-fun' slogan.

--gr8idea: reduce workload
From NY, I said daddy would complete some homework for you if too hard. 

I need to rethink. He probably needs more perseverance.

--gr8idea: at most one problem per weekday night
and must start by 9pm

-- my deep (vague) disappointment with my renzi effort was largely due to the worldly, materialistic "progress". 

No progress, then i feel time wasted. That's materialistic and impatience.

--digitize a pool of 10-> 20 common and EASY problem sum questions (word problems) at p2-p4 levels
Ensure he masters the common pattern-recog. I think the patterns are also relevant in the U.S. exams.

Tie big rewards () and small rewards() to his performance on MY questions.

My effort is really on collecting common exam questions.  I hate to do this but I think now....

--new: word problems are not that "important"
I think his math thinking is not bad, as shown in geometry.

there are many skills of practical value.

I think my son may show more interest in the less abstract subjects like science, or coding.

--email to grandparents
我的同学有好几个拒绝学英语， 更多的同学讨厌政治，或历史， 或语文。 这些同学后来成绩也没有那么糟糕。 都及格了。 

这几科大都是中学科目。 12 岁以上。

得过且过，尽量少吃苦，这种学习态度，挺常见的。

也听说有的孩子拒绝完成作业。 
--probably need to reduce my effort and t-spend on boy's math, to 20% (of my disposable energy), leaving 75% for work and 5% for tech xx

Meanwhile, reduce the expectation of the payoff of my effort. It is likely extremely disappointing. 

Boy's word problem weakness -- wife and me both need to confront this reality, this pain. nowhere to hide. We are cornered.

It's a deep emotional pain for both parents. We fire up each other, unfortunately. 

Looking back, we often feel and say it was a minor thing, but in the moment it is painful, to put it mildly.

--new jolt: he has strengths that can compensate for his limited absorbency for abstract...
* geometry
* science
* English reading as a pleasure ... so precious

--new jolt: absorbency and effort
my criticism on boy is mostly about effort and absorbency. 
but my own absorbency is also limited. So is my wife's absorbency. 五十步笑百步。 I'm unable to do x leetcode problems a week!

I think I know the consequences better than he does.
I guess he lacks self-discipline, seriously lacking

I think my son is making serious effort. His math talent and absorbency (abilities) is limited. If that's the case we have no reason to blame him. We should accept him as he is.

Is Absorbency part of effort or abilities? Now I don't know. In my case, it's abilities. In my son, i tend to see it as effort... double standard!

--new blogpost: xxxq = interest for learning specific topics
Here I'm excluding physical skills, but "learning" doesn't equal classroom learning.

I would say whenever my son reads a book he is learning something, not always academic.

 
--fuxi
It's easy to feel love for a younger kid. Younger kids are visibly vulnerable and dependent on us the parents. Parents feel a protective instinct when we see our little kids.

It's harder to maintain the unconditional love and patience for an older kid.

--the media suggests that many parents (mostly mothers) of pre-teens spend half their weekends taking kids to places and expose them to in-situ learning. 

In q3SG phase, I was silly enough to follow these suggestions. I forgot I'm a different parent with my own priorities and limitations. One of the key differences -- 
My spare time is so precious to me. Many of These parents have lots of spare time that they spend on e-entertainments (gaming, internet surfing, online chatting) dining out, socializing. I'm completely different. 

The t-cost of weekend TO me is 5 times higher than the cost TO them. 

Another key difference -- their effort possibly paid off more than in my son.

--new blogpost: devoting weekends to his math@@
some parents are effective math tutors; others realize it's counterproductive. I now realize I tend to lose my cool if he doesn't show commitment.

I feel he will not engage or cooperate, but better stay positive.
 
At this age learning energy should start to come from within, like a wellspring. 
Otherwise there's limited engagement, poor focus, poor traction, poor retention. 
Very low ROTI for me.

If he doesn't show commitment, the biggest risk would the relationship. If I spend more than an hour on a weekend day, Regrets due to low ROTI is a second risk.... big risks.

--new blogpost: 
most of my huge effort to help boy was on the same area -- 上进， 不甘落后，克服困难，持之以恒重复练习， 不怕枯燥。

在这方面， 最有效的帮助是课外活动， 比如钢琴， 不必拿啥名次或证书， 就说他坚持到今天，没有终止，就是不可思议的进步，因为大宝的天性是非常的而不是一般的贪玩，

再比如游泳跑步，他都接受了。没有放弃。

这几项都是家长决定之后，提议坚持。 决定得对。 

除了这个方面， 我也曾帮大宝培养华文兴趣， 减肥， 没啥效果。 

--fuxi: reading with boy .. is too time-consuming , low roti
grandpa can do it. I simply can't afford.

Even reading on train with boy is way too time-consuming.

with boy's Chinese, I put in so much effort over those 4.5 years but not effective.
Now with math I won't have so much energy to spare. This task competes directly against my day job for my limited laser energy.

am not putting in so many hours helping meimei with her Chinese, but I don't feel so guilty

when I put in the time to help him on his math, i have to deal with bitter disappointments and confront my past i.e. the renzi experience.

--fuxi: jogging can be punishment, but piano, math drill should not be punishment. Boy may grow to hate them.

Actually, jogging can be a positive experience as it strengthens the body and mind.

I really have insufficient justification to beat him. He is putting in some effort, albeit insufficient compared to other kids. He is scared of me.

--fuxi: overweight consultation
I think Cigna look at the type of doctor. If we see a dietitian, Cigna will immediately suspect and probably won’t accept.

We can see a pediatric specialist first. Then ask for in-depth tests. If test too expensive, then ask Cigna first.

It’s possible that some experts have seen similar cases and have insight.

--fuxi:
Hougang trip with boy in 2012 (and similar trips) were poor bargains -- high tcost no pleasure no benefit, like wasting money on a distasteful and high-calorie meal
Later trips to stadium/pool/climbing were better

Now I know better how I want to spend my precious time with boy -- exercise, study, nearby shopping, have real fun not necessarily spending money

--new blogpost: benchmark: growing gap behind those academic kids
I think Lianzhong, Jingheng and many China families that tuition teachers describe are in a different category. 
Their parents are more pushing and the students more talented in terms of absorbency.
The repetitive drills set them apart from the "regular" students. 
The gap in standardized benchmarks is rather large like ... even the simplest problems for me was hard for my sister's classmates.

At college level, you still need repetitive practices but less important.
The regular kids may catch up.

--email to wife/grandparents:
我下半年回新工作后， 会逐渐减少大宝的繁重作业， 因为对孩子学习帮助不大。 

比如数学难题， 做很多还是掌握不了。 也许他的同学能掌握， 那可能是他们能承受反复练习， 大宝没他们的耐力， 或许不应归罪为孩子的错。 

我决心做有智慧和胆识的家长。 数学这科我学的最久， 有自己的体会，观点。 我的决策，基于我的亲身体会和我对大宝的观察， 应该比老师更有根据。 老师的优势， 在于对同年龄学生的了解

--new blog: PSLE is serious
需要改变大宝几年来的观念 , 好像不必在乎 PSLE, 反正到美国就轻松了.

事实上, 美国轻松的学校很多都不是好学校. 美国中学生也要竞争, 也有考试, 也有难题, 也需要坚持和努力, 不学无术的学生大都没有好出路, 只能被淘汰到社会底层.

我曾计划大宝来美, 家住北昂小镇, 能进所谓天才班, 但如果他现在不努力, 恐怕到时候进不去.

考虑正式参加 PSLE, 一家人共同经历这个磨难。 爷爷说也许是件好事， 好像军训. 学习生涯不都是轻松自在的. 压力,磨难有时免不了. 竞争, 是注定免不了的.

在美国, 要上好大学得从 15 岁开始竞争. 也是有压力的.
--
学习是任务, 不喜欢也得接受. 
作业是繁重, 但别的同学能做完, 我们也能.

我们总说大宝不努力。 我没有给他足够的夸奖， 爸爸做的不够。

可以考虑给他一些压力。 这个年岁可以承受一些压力 （包括数学作业）。 但避免厌学。 

我还是提倡温和地坚持。 学习和作业的目标就定为考分。 每天学习最少30分钟， 要他自己认同而不是家长强加的。

完不成学习任务的后果最好是自然的，要不就是他自选的， 而不是家长制造出的后果。 怎么把"后果"和奖励结合呢？

不甘下游
