--My frustration escalates when working with dabao's word problems.
In contrast, his English, science and non-word math problems are not alarming, intolerable to me. 
I think my yardstick is myself and other China students, whose standard is higher in math than other subjects. 
By my yardstick, perhaps all those China students and myself are extremely poor and substandard in English.

My frustration grows as he runs out of time on his math homework.
As the clock approaches 10pm, the pressure, frustration grows.

My frustration escalates when he refuses to follow my "simple" instructions.

My frustration escalates when I look at his benchmark

His frustration escalates when he fears that he would not complete his homework.
I think I need to be ruthless and refuse to help.

Face time: When I lose my cool, i need to consider emergency exit.

--Let us accept #short term consequences
accept that he could have more joy in a lighter-load learning environment but he is unable to climb up there. A tower with a hot section at the base...

Accept that he will spend lots of his precious spare time in useless homework and additional tuition, not learning much.

Accept that because of heavy homework, he would have limited sleep. I would have few ways to motivate him.

--I do have some (not infinite) spare time thanks to MLP job
for boy's math practice, baby-sitting facetime is likely to help him, until I lose my cool
--fuxi: I asked Raymond why Malay students seldom out-perform.
Raymond is confident that IQ is not one of the factors.

He said another factor is that Malay parents have too many kids and too little spare time outside work (often 1.5 to two jobs). Jack He also said affluent families often have full time mom taking care of kids.

Raymond pointed out the hours he spends with his boys.

--fuxi: exam scores don't mean much to my son
At some age, he would realize the importance of these scores.

At age 11 the meaning isn’t so crystal clear in his mind. It only means parents delight/anger/disappointment, and more tuition.

I hoped that he would put up with practice to avoid more practice, but does anyone do that? Practice would be seen as a very negative experience.

There’s no internal desire for the score. I don’t see the fire in him.

--fuxi: boy experiences a lot of internal resistance to math practice
I also experience the same with chin-up, stretching and coding drill

If no choice due to strict rule from dad, then not so much suffering and resistance.

Self-discipline without external help is harder.

--Kevin Chen said
confidence in math ... extremely imp. His turning point

My turning point in chinese compo is similar.

--Genn's discussion
for math, More nurturing less demanding; instead of telling him what to do, suggest to him.

Rebuild his self-esteem and confidence in math.

He doesn't show all his cards. He may have some special skills; he may feel ashamed sometimes.

Get boy to finish the toughest homework early, before dinner, to fend off the fearful math teacher.

Consider stopping the Science/Eng tuition. It is counter-productive to developing his motivation and self responsibility.

I often show my lack of confidence in his abilities , his luck, his future progress, ,, it would affect him. 

--fuxi: Chinese parenting, and Buddhism emphasizes self-restraint.
Western culture emphasizes hard driving, achievement, so I think some motivated or high-achievers have limited self-restraint

gaming is the prime example.

--fuxi: my own Eng tuition experience in 1992
The real effective effort is focused exam-prep xx and practice by myself. 
The mental focus is driven by the motivation. 
The 1H/week session is not the catalyst that helped many other students. 

For my son, since he is not motivated enough, there's basically nothing much I can do except strict punishment in the form of deprivation. 

carrot and stick short term tgt-control

--fuxi: lucky my boy is not too skinny or short
--fuxi: 5 lang of love for boy
physical gifts
quality time -- keeping company. He doesn't like to be left alone, except with a screen

--fuxi: I'm STILL trying to make dabao another tanbin
This tendency is very stubborn and subtle.

He has his own strengths, interests, hobbies, preferred way to solving problems and meeting challenges ....

I have my weaknesses, limitations, faults in my making. Over many years of "adjustment" I have come to terms with some of my limitations. Now I need to accept his limitations. 

Look at Genn. As a parent how would I accept her as she is, rather than a very poor copy of me?

--fuxi: unexpected successes ROTI with boy #peter drucker:
NTUC trips
math sheet on his own
macRitchie
jogging in stadium

--new: promise-kept: reward4boy{he improves xx
bring him out to play comp games
bring him to ikea -- less unusable commute tcost

Most of these require my time!

--Q: what are the signs that he is giving up too early, and what are the "opposite" signs that he has tried enough but had no good clue?
A: concentration

Q: what are his signs of fatigue?
Remember I also have fatigue with many practice subjects such as trigo

--Q: I want boy to gain from this tough SG math program @@
* word problem-solving techniques? No. Too contrived and not needed in u.s. high school(?) or in adult life
* arithmetic proficiency. Note ratios and decimal point shift don't need calculator
* absorbency and perseverance to applying his mind and recall what he learned before?
* not giving up? I doubt he can learn this skill better in the SG system than in U.S.
* self-discipline and perseverance? I doubt it.

-- my deep (vague) disappointment with my renzi effort was largely due to the worldly, materialistic "progress". 
No progress, then i feel time wasted. That's materialistic and impatience.

It's easy to feel love for a younger kid. Younger kids are visibly vulnerable and dependent on us the parents. Parents feel a protective instinct when we see our little kids.

It's harder to maintain the unconditional love and patience for an older kid.

--fuxi:  
most of my huge effort to help boy was on the same area -- 上进， 不甘落后，克服困难，持之以恒重复练习， 不怕枯燥。

在这方面， 最有效的帮助是课外活动， 比如钢琴， 不必拿啥名次或证书， 就说他坚持到今天，没有终止，就是不可思议的进步，因为大宝的天性是非常的而不是一般的贪玩，

再比如游泳跑步，他都接受了。没有放弃。

这几项都是家长决定之后，提议坚持。 决定得对。 

除了这个方面， 我也曾帮大宝培养华文兴趣， 减肥， 没啥效果。 

--fuxi: overweight consultation
I think Cigna look at the type of doctor. If we see a dietitian, Cigna will immediately suspect and probably won’t accept.

We can see a pediatric specialist first. Then ask for in-depth tests. If test too expensive, then ask Cigna first.

It’s possible that some experts have seen similar cases and have insight.

--new blogpost: benchmark: growing gap behind those academic kids
I think Lianzhong, Jingheng and many China families that tuition teachers describe are in a different category. 
Their parents are more pushing and the students more talented in terms of absorbency.

The repetitive drills set them apart from the "regular" students. 

According to standardized benchmarks, the gap is rather large like ... even the simplest problems for me was hard for my sister's classmates.
At college level, you still need repetitive practices but less important.
The regular kids may catch up.

--email to wife/grandparents:
我下半年回新工作后， 会逐渐减少大宝的繁重作业， 因为对孩子学习帮助不大。 

比如数学难题， 做很多还是掌握不了。 也许他的同学能掌握， 那可能是他们能承受反复练习， 大宝没他们的耐力， 或许不应归罪为孩子的错。 

我决心做有智慧和胆识的家长。 数学这科我学的最久， 有自己的体会，观点。 我的决策，基于我的亲身体会和我对大宝的观察， 应该比老师更有根据。 老师的优势， 在于对同年龄学生的了解

--new blog: PSLE is serious
事实上, 美国轻松的学校很多都不是好学校. 美国中学生也要竞争, 也有考试, 也有难题, 也需要坚持和努力, 不学无术的学生大都没有好出路, 只能被淘汰到社会底层.

我曾计划大宝来美, 家住北昂小镇, 能进所谓天才班, 但如果他现在不努力, 恐怕到时候进不去.

考虑正式参加 PSLE, 一家人共同经历这个磨难。 爷爷说也许是件好事， 好像军训. 学习生涯不都是轻松自在的. 压力,磨难有时免不了. 竞争, 是注定免不了的.

在美国, 要上好大学得从 15 岁开始竞争. 也是有压力的.
--
学习是任务, 不喜欢也得接受. 
作业是繁重, 但别的同学能做完, 我们也能.

我们总说大宝不努力。 我没有给他足够的夸奖， 爸爸做的不够。

可以考虑给他一些压力。 这个年岁可以承受一些压力 （包括数学作业）。 但避免厌学。 

我还是提倡温和地坚持。 学习和作业的目标就定为考分。 每天学习最少30分钟， 要他自己认同而不是家长强加的。

完不成学习任务的后果最好是自然的，要不就是他自选的， 而不是家长制造出的后果。 怎么把"后果"和奖励结合呢？

不甘下游
