I feel I need to focus more on motivation than benchmark 

The fixation on academic relative ranking is painful and frustrating. 
Itâ€™s always relative to fellow students. I have zero control over the performance of fellow students.

Each kid has a different needs. My son may need more time to wind down before he starts his homework.

Teenagers may take a few years to open up to parents... I want to have time for them when they open up. Less stressful job, shorter commute, ,,,

Some strong students suffer when they move to a top school and find themselves at the bottom. I think I had that experience in my physics Olympiad training camp at Grade 10.

--fuxi: counselling :
For at least a few weeks, focus on self-care (incl. sleep). As to Parenting and control -- revisit in late May. Am not in a position to control boy. Am weak.

set ground rules for entire family to follow such as what time I need to sleep. I feel these need to be realistic.

When ah-boy misbehaves, disengage. Let Go. Avoid confrontation. Act as if I'm in NY.

Consider white noise apps like Tide to block out the screaming. Use earphone if needed.

--fuxi: I predicted that remote learning would play to boy's advantage
Our advantage -- wife not working + my flexible hours.
Our advantage -- multiple devices
Our advantage -- boy is expert at devices
Our disadvantage in traditional setting -- boy dislikes paper-based learning. A screen is like a big toy.

Just like GM assumes everyone hates heat, I have a bias against online video classes, but if boy can benefit then there are many online learning materials

--fuxi: dietitian's rules are too strict to be realistic
absolutely no McDonald's?
