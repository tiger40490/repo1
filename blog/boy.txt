warning -- he may prefer the smartphone or tablet. His usage of laptop might be restricted to ...

Q: do we need to buy new?
A: I think we can give him from my own stock

warning -- boy is very picky (so is grandma). To make him feel satisfied, the new-buy may be rather expensive but any device given to him can get damaged easily.

big idea -- behaviors that generate unpredicable rewards would quickly become habits.

This is at brain level, and proven in animals too.

Ashish told me about an Indian Australian girl he dated remotely. She is overweight, but Ashish was extremely confident he could make her work out really hard and lose weight. Similarly, I was confident that I could control my kids' screen addiction, diet, exercise etc. In reality, self-regulation is overriding.

Confidence is generally a good thing, but unrealistic, naive confidence is the seed of my deep pains. Confidence about how much influence you have over a family member is usually overconfidence. Overconfidence in parenting is common.

Many parenting cliches suggest that parents have the authority to incluence (yes) and POWER (no) to control (no) their young children's behavior, habits. Well, the only things that control children are prisons and mental institutions. (In contrast, schools and hopistal wards do not have control.)

--Jack on my family migration
U.S. migration might be more risky for your kids then for you

Make sure you still have enough time for your kids when you are working here.

U.S. parenting culture -- more encouragement, more confidence building, less "rule-abiding" as I experienced first-hand in Singapore system.

If you feel your son will become a manager type, then perhaps the wordy problem skills (abstract logical skills) are not really relevant in the long run. Self-confidence is arguably more important.

Both Jack and grandpa foresee that my derogatory remarks could easily damage boy's confidence.  I use such harsh words to get his attention, but apparently the net effect is counterproductive. Jack suggested -- paste reminder on your computer, in your cockpit, on the mirror ... to remind yourself.

Given the lack of interest in wordy problems, U.S. culture would probably emphasize encouragement not forced practice.

-- new: perseverance in U.S. school culture
u.s. pop culture (esp. for kids) is dominated by individual heros powered with determination, optimism, perseverance, fighting on the uphill, against all odds ...

However, the enemy is often a natural adversity (including a biological limitation), or a villain. The enemy is seldom some competitive exam, man-made... Fake enemy, fake achievement.

--jolt: my view of U.S. vs Chinese parenting culture/practices
I tend to feel U.S. is weaker, ineffective and failing, but look at the output of these two cultures. Out of 10,000 white-collar families, the number of "successful" (beyond grades) adjult children is not higher among the Chinese. In fact, as soon as we look beyond standard benchmarks, the picture would be very very different. 

-- counselling :
For at least a few weeks, focus on self-care (incl. sleep). As to Parenting and control -- revisit in late May. Am not in a position to control boy. Am weak.

set ground rules for entire family to follow such as what time I need to sleep. I feel these need to be realistic.

When ah-boy misbehaves, disengage. Let Go. Avoid confrontation. Act as if I'm in NY.

Consider white noise apps like Tide to block out the screaming. Use earphone if needed.

-- how do I reward boy? catch a movie together and explain to him?
biking?
dance with him?

-- Jack Zhang chat
高压 discipline ..

Observe what the kid wants and fulfill his needs.

keep the communication open as they go through adolescence. 

Accept some variations in individual personalities.

Curiosity is a good thing in a kid.

-- Cigna counselor chat
my anger towards boy is rather impulsive (irrational). I tend to attribute "all my pains" to this boy, when the real reason is my own reaction.

Remember DeepakG's words? 

The biggest risk is harm to him (also to myself), and to our bond. In a way, I need to always keep that risk in mind.

anger mgmt !

--I feel I need to focus more on motivation than benchmark 
The fixation on academic relative ranking is painful and frustrating. It’s always relative to fellow students. I have poor control over the performance of fellow students.

I need to spend more time understanding my kids – their interests, fears, self-doubts, ,,,

Each kid has a different needs. My son may need more time to wind down before he starts his homework.

Teenagers may take a few years to open up to parents... I want to have time for them when they open up. Less stressful job, shorter commute, ,,,

Some strong students suffer when they move to a top school and find themselves at the bottom. I think I had that experience in my physics Olympiad training camp.

--keywords to keep in mind
温和的坚持

keep the cool

keep the voice lower and slower -- sign of authority

more patience (but firm)

--I predicted that remote learning would play to boy's advantage
Our advantage -- wife not working + my flexible hours.
Our advantage -- multiple devices
Our disadvantage in traditional setting -- boy dislikes paper-based learning. A screen is like a big toy.

Just like GM assumes everyone hates heat, I have a bias against online video classes, but if boy can benefit then there are many online learning materials

What would be a real sabotage of daddy's coaching effort? How about passive resistance?
How would a dicerning parent decide when to give up?

If not dicerning enough, then I would hit bitter contention, painful disappointment, wheel-spinning, self-hate, regretable ROTI, losing my cool

--Q: covid19 close-down: by default, boy is losing time for swim, basketball, and spend more time .. doing nothing. 
How can we improve his time utilization?

Luckily, he is reading books.

--new: 
clarify and reinforce my guesstimate -- his eng is better than 95% of China students; his science is probably better than 51% of China students; his math is better than some rural China students who lack adequate learning resources including parents and tutors

--fuxi: anger mgmt at face time
therapeutic blogging really helps.

--if boy asks "can i leave one question to tomorrow?" I need to be a bit careful with my promise. 
It was nice to be decisive but it's actually fine to be hesitant and vague.

--fuxi: boy enjoys board game without being very good. but it is a better past time than screens
I was never good at any board game, 

--fuxi: with science, his foundation is sound, much better than his math abstract thinking.
However, he is not hungry for the marks. Not focused on the marks.
Therefore, his more mature classmates have a clear advantage over him.

--fuxi: should we remind him of the secondary school he picked?
Is he feeling any motivation? Perhaps non-zero
I need to be extremely careful not to turn it into negative motivation or ridicule

--fuxi: 
Q: $25 basketball paid too much?

The basketball buying experience is probably one of the defining experiences.
The main (perhaps implicit) message I sent across is -- If you are going to 喜新厌旧, then we can only spend a small amount. If you are going to keep this basketball for a long time, then we can spend a little more. 
I think he got the message, even though he may not use it frquently.
My estimate of that "frequency" is emotionally biased and unreliable.
Therefore, my answr to Q1 is also biased.

I too believe the first few versions of anything we buy are only for trying out. However in this case, we bought three previous versions -- way too high.

--fuxi: earlier I told boy he had a parachute -- after PSLE he would go to U.S.
Now he has to face the harsh reality that the parachute is lost.

--fuxi: lost my cool. In hind sight, I did notice it and briefly considered leaving the scene but I felt that would be a defeat of a parent by a child!

Actually boy had already conceded once and agreed to listen to me showing him my method, but in the end he was "punished" as a result.... and feeling cheated.

I did raise my voice many times,,, a sign of losing my cool.

For a moment, I wanted to hit him or smash something (better than a smack),,, a sign of losing my cool.

Self-awareness is my key strength. Compared to other guys, I am better able to step out of myself and observe the person.

I need to recognize my limitation as a father and coach. One of the biggest limitations is losing my cool.
If and when I acknowledge my limitation, I should get help.

When hitting boy, it's important to have another parent present. Boy and I were both lucky that grandparents were around, to help maintain a balance, which is very much needed when I lose my cool but continue to engage in confrontational facetime.

Word problems with fractions are the toughest for boy. He would need to apply his mind and persevere


--fuxi:
As a student, I found certain subjects completely boring and useless -- politics, Chinese, biology

Most of my classmates felt the same about history, and trigo

So we were not motivated to memorize or practice.

--fuxi: overweight consultation
I think Cigna look at the type of doctor. If we see a dietitian, Cigna will immediately suspect and probably won’t accept.

We can see a pediatric specialist first. Then ask for in-depth tests. If test too expensive, then ask Cigna first.

It’s possible that some experts have seen similar cases and have insight.

--fuxi: boy experiences a lot of internal resistance to math practice esp pattern recog in wordy problems
I also experience the same with chin-up, stretching and coding drill

If no choice due to strict rule from dad, then not so much suffering and resistance.

Self-discipline without external help is harder.
