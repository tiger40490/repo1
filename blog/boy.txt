-- parenting principles
there are many many books, websites, seminars... I think the princples are "mostly" the same as generations ago, with adaptations to deal with the modern world.

(Same can be said about relationsships, management, leadership..) I only need a handful of books, learn a few dozen principles. The challenge is the execution/implementation/enforcement of these few principles.

People like to say "simple rules" .. simple to express, simple to understand, but not simple to practice. For each simple principle, if 100 parents understand it, probably 99 would try it and 50 would give up and forget it.

Each parent can only practice up to 10 principles before putting some of them on shelf. Therefore, each parent need to pick a small number and then review them (like blogging). It's same as any practice.

For many (simple) principles, there's a lot of resistance from the parent, the other parent, or the kids.  Therefore, it requires time and energy. Most of us lack both. Therefore, we need prioritizing, and sacrifice.

For me, if I see traction, then I don't mind spending the time. 

One of the tractions I see is blogging esp. review.

-- Raymond's boys are in a lower position
The younger boy is "slow learning" according to Raymond.

The older boy has now failed to pass 3 subjects and can only pass science at end of P5. Geometry is one weakness.

The mother didn't help out with Chinese, but grandma said we should not blame the mother.

--new: physical discipline.. 
i have memories or knowledge of Chinese parents who use physical pain as dicipine. Some result in bruises and minor bleeding. 

Some of my son's classmates were subject to routine whipping at home.

Subconsciously I put those images at the end of a spectrum which includes my level of punishment in the middle section. Sometimes that end is regarded as unacceptable or criminal [1]. Other times that end is regarded as commonplace and widespread among the Chinese parents.

[1] as a parent, I put myself into a defensive position. Other family members could become witnesses to a criminal act. Singapore police investigation officer will take up the case as long as there's a report filed.

low-impact, no-trauma physical punishment is safer.

-- compare the anger-release choices:
spitting
smashing to the floor
yelling
breaking other things like piano, bifold
wall-facing, either kneeling or standing
smack - must be done in the presense of another parent, and not in anger -- very tough

-- Spitting on meimei was over-reaction. Not a good example for boy.
Maybe I should apologize to meimei.

Note spitting is still better than physical hitting.

My James Madison handyman said "scare your kid" only for education on electrcity.  I feel "scare her" is not a general approach to discipline

-- tanko reminds boy: if you don't pass IPPT, you will be requried to attend extra fitness training for months or years -- tough, punishing. Even after discharge, you need to come back every Saturday.

-- even though tanko's brothers are not earning a lot..
They have equal shares of parents' love.
They are in reasonable health and take reasonable care of themselves.
They are fairly frugal and spend within their means.

Tanko supports his jobless first brother and buys a home to house both brothers. I said "You look like a parent to them". Tanko felt fair. "If they get into difficulties it would be my problem too."

Q: is it possible to have a good life without good education or high income?  碌碌无为...
A: possible for some time, until something happens and you need cash to deal with it.

-- one specific small tip from wq.l: write down the failed exam questions and review them
Would need mother's buy-in

A simple technique, easy to implement iFF he is willing, motivated.

-- Once the weak student starts to score, his confidence could improve. His fear/interest sentiment will improve. Condition is the desire.
In a sense, the score serves as a reward, a target, a constant feedback.

-- in terms of benchmarks, my son is better than many Singapore boys we know.
I don't want to focus too much on benchmarks. More important is the attitude, mtv. 

-- need to repeat to boy:
Some people play games but score higher in exams.
Some people smoke, drink alcohol, take drugs, but live longer than me who don't. Reality remains -- those substances are harmful to their health.


--sugg: if boy doesn't shout on a weekday when dad is home, reward him with SGD $1 from grandpa, comparable to daily effort. 
Ask boy which reward should be higher.
