I was never good at any board game,

What would be a real sabotage of daddy's coaching effort? How about passive resistance?
How would a dicerning parent decide when to give up?

If not dicerning enough, then I would hit bitter contention, painful disappointment, wheel-spinning, self-hate, regretable ROTI, losing my cool


--with science, his foundation is sound, much better than his math abstract thinking.

However, he is not hungry for the marks. Not focused on the marks.
Therefore, his more mature classmates have a clear advantage over him.

--fuxi: should we remind him of the secondary school he picked?
Is he feeling any motivation? Perhaps non-zero
I need to be extremely careful not to turn it into negative motivation or ridicule

--fuxi: 
The basketball buying experience is probably one of the defining experiences.
The main (perhaps implicit) message I sent across is -- If you are going to 喜新厌旧, then we can only spend a small amount. If you are going to keep this basketball for a long time, then we can spend a little more.

I too believe the first few versions of anything we buy are only for trying out. However in this case, we bought three previous versions -- way too high.

-- Q: how does boy feel about parents' pride in having him as a son?
Q: how does he feel when other parents talk about their kids in positive terms.

--fuxi: 温和的坚持 can help avoid creating in boy a seed of hatred, fear 

--fuxi: lost my cool. In hind sight, I did notice it and briefly considered leaving the scene but I felt that would be a defeat.
Actually boy had already conceded once and agreed to listen to me showing him my method, but in the end he was "punished" as a result.... and feeling cheated.

I did raise my voice many times,,, a sign of losing my cool.

For a moment, I wanted to hit him or smash something (better than hitting),,, a sign of losing my cool.

Self-awareness is my key strength. Compared to other guys, I am better able to step out of myself and observe the person.

I need to recognize my limitation as a father and coach. One of the biggest limitations is losing my cool.
If and when I acknowledge my limitation, I should get help.

When hitting boy, it's important to have another parent present. Boy and I were both lucky that grandparents were around, to help maintain a balance, which is very much needed when I lose my cool but continue to engage in confrontational facetime.

Word problems with fractions are the toughest for boy. He would need to apply his mind and persevere

--fuxi: exam scores don't mean much to my son
At some age, he would realize the importance of these scores.

At age 11 the meaning isn’t so crystal clear in his mind. It only means parents delight/anger/disappointment, and more tuition.

I hoped that he would put up with practice to avoid more practice, but does anyone do that? Practice would be seen as a very negative experience.

There’s no internal desire for the score. I don’t see the fire in him.

--fuxi: boy experiences a lot of internal resistance to math practice esp pattern recog in word problems
I also experience the same with chin-up, stretching and coding drill

If no choice due to strict rule from dad, then not so much suffering and resistance.

Self-discipline without external help is harder.

--fuxi: Kevin Chen said
confidence in math ... extremely imp. His turning point. I think this won't happen so soon.

My turning point in chinese compo is similar.

--fuxi: Genn's discussion
I often show my lack of confidence in his abilities , his luck, his future progress, ,, it would affect him. 

for math, More nurturing less demanding; instead of telling him what to do, suggest to him.

Rebuild his self-esteem and confidence in math.

He doesn't show all his cards. He may have some special skills; he may feel ashamed sometimes.

Get boy to finish the toughest homework early, before dinner, to fend off the fearful math teacher.

Consider stopping the Science/Eng tuition. It is counter-productive to developing his motivation and self responsibility.

--fuxi: my own English tuition experience in 1992
The real effective effort is focused exam-prep xx and practice by myself. 
The mental focus is driven by the motivation. 
The 1H/week session is not the catalyst that helped many other students. 

For my son, since he is not motivated enough, there's basically nothing much I can do except strict punishment in the form of deprivation. 

carrot and stick short term tgt-control

--fuxi: my deep (vague) disappointment with my renzi effort was largely due to the worldly, materialistic "progress". 
No progress, then i feel zero roti. That's materialistic and impatience.

It's easy to feel love for a younger kid. Younger kids are visibly vulnerable and dependent on us the parents. Parents feel a protective instinct when we see our little kids.

It's harder to maintain the unconditional love and patience for an older kid.

--fuxi:   no subject
most of my huge effort to help boy was on the same area -- 上进， 不甘落后，克服困难，持之以恒重复练习， 不怕枯燥。

在这方面， 最有效的帮助是课外活动， 比如钢琴， 不必拿啥名次或证书， 就说他坚持到今天，没有终止，就是不可思议的进步，因为大宝的天性是非常的而不是一般的贪玩，

再比如游泳跑步，他都接受了。没有放弃。

这几项都是家长决定之后，提议坚持。 决定得对。 

除了这个方面， 我也曾帮大宝培养华文兴趣， 减肥， 没啥效果。 

--fuxi: lucky my boy is not too skinny or short
--fuxi: 5 lang of love for boy
physical gifts
quality time -- keeping company. He doesn't like to be left alone, except with a screen

Q: why does love matter in this academic benchmark race?
A: because support, family bonding ,,, outweights the crazy benchmark

--fuxi: I'm STILL trying to make dabao another tanbin
This tendency is very stubborn and subtle.

He has his own strengths, interests, hobbies, preferred way to solving problems and meeting challenges ....

I have my weaknesses, limitations, faults in my making. Over many years of "adjustment" I have come to terms with some of my limitations. Now I need to accept his limitations. 

Look at Genn. As a parent how would I accept her as she is, rather than a very poor copy of me?

--fuxi:
As a student, I found certain subjects completely boring and useless -- politics, Chinese, biology

Most of my classmates felt the same about history, and trigo

So we were not motivated to memorize or practice.

--fuxi: teach anger mgmt by calming down your own frustration

--fuxi: I asked Raymond why Malay students seldom out-perform.
Raymond is confident that IQ is not one of the factors.

He said another factor is that Malay parents have too many kids and too little spare time outside work (often 1.5 to two jobs). Jack He also said affluent families often have full time mom taking care of kids.

Raymond pointed out the hours he spends with his boys.

--fuxi: overweight consultation
I think Cigna look at the type of doctor. If we see a dietitian, Cigna will immediately suspect and probably won’t accept.

We can see a pediatric specialist first. Then ask for in-depth tests. If test too expensive, then ask Cigna first.

It’s possible that some experts have seen similar cases and have insight.
