-- new: edu resources
In the U.S. (and to some extent SG, Chn), edu resources are unevenly distributed, in favor of the rich. 
They have access to top school districts, private tutors, a stay-home mom, a father with plenty of paid leaves, counselling/treatment for special difficulties (every kid seems to have some)

-- U.S. high schools might be too relaxed for my son, too dependent on individual initiative as if these students are adults.

-- Most (50%+) students (adults too) are inefficient on multiple fronts
* too many gaming hours
* slow start in daily homework
* late sleep, perhaps on weekends
* getting up late
* no rest on commute. No reading either
** not paying attention and missing the stops
* sleepy in class, unable to follow some topics
* too busy to have rest and exercise. low energy

In many schools, there is sufficient buffer for these inefficient students to survive, but how about your school. I think a boarding school is a good training ground.

The key is chipaway at efficiency improvement and self-discipline on a few identified fronts. Aim to achieve above-average efficiency in at least some fronts.

SG extraterritorial penalty on drug usage is a deterrent for my kids. 
Can be a valuable restraint and deterrent.

--new: worst unacceptable outcome@boy

.. is not wellness condition
David's answer -- refusal to talk to parents
Grandpa's answer -- running away from home

My answer is -- effort. If he puts in effort but ends up with those results, I feel I would love him unconditionally. I recall XR's autistic son.

Teresa Teng was not a strong math student (perhaps like my daughter) but worked hard at every subject.

Currently, despite his piano practice, his poor effort everyday is eroding the loving relationship. Unconditional love is under threat. Boy is very sensitive and can probably sense it.

Grandma notices the tension between two forces inside me. She drew this analogy -- imagine your sponse is diagnoised with cancer. You experience the huge pressure to take on the huge legwork and decide on treatment options for the spouse. At the same time, you may also feel the tendency to reject the cancer, and blame the cancer, but the cancer won't go away. Grandma said the 2nd, negative emotion is counterproductive. Yet it is real and common. 
I feel this is a good analogy. The cancer may be incurable. You still have a job to fight it and slow down its progression.

Remember Biden's love for his son, despite the son's drug problem. I would say Biden is still a successful father. Indeed a father would be successful if he did his best to stop the progression of such an addiction.

In the same blogpost, there's also a gay son's story. Is that an "effort" problem?

I'm no perfect child myself. If I have a son like me, is there something I can't accept? Theft!

My son has no aggression, no cruelty, no dishonesty,,,, that's why I find his laziness unacceptable.

ask each kid to tell me one enjoyable time when dad spends time with you that make you feel comfortable?

boy .. cycling? Tram?
meimei .. singing

The time I sacrifice for them may not be effective on the receiving end.

-- new: unequal access to edu resources 
In U.S. I believe the rich and the well-educated has better access to edu resources, esp. top schools.

My focus in this bpost is Singaproe, but I would make comparisons to U.S. or China.

Social mobility? Not my initial focus in this bpost. My critics may point out various evidence of social mobility in terms of education, but I think statistics would prove my point.

In Singapore, those China families that I hear about.. invariably have white-collar parents educated in China. Using the family resources [mostly the parents and their better genes], these China families often outcompete local students and get into top schools[local edu resources]. 

Some rich families have a stay-home parent to help the kids... a Resource!

I discussed some of it with Jialing.Zheng. Don't remember what he said. I said it's unfair of me to compare my son with those China families' kids.

-- fuxi: training fee is a doubly-edged sword
It can create pains in parents. High fees can lead to hightened conflicts between parents and kids.

It can induce commitment, provided the kid is "ready".

I think Dr Colin Ong see the same sword, when it comes to the treatment fees.

-- fuxi: Aaron and Claris said overseas educated graduates tend to stand out. Their benchmark was local grads.
I said I feel local university grads have impressed me. I was using some undefined benchmark, perhaps the older workers.
-- fuxi: how can we give boy a sense of ownership of his SGD account?
After that, we can use it as reward/penalty

I am "weak" overall, but there are a few /precious/ bright spots.
improvement? Mostly invisible, but there are some success stories.
even though I do put in non-trivial effort, I don't put in enough practice. Enough is probably 30m a day.
My lotus ... is probably enough.
lifelong mission .. you can't ignore it or brush it under the carpet forever.

We want to utilize external help, but many people don't want to rely so much on external help. It's often more sustainable to build up a home practice

-- new private: Ken See's inspirational story
HCI -> St Andrew's JC -> NTU Sociology acceptance, but went to NorthEastern "business" degree -> UPenn special Master's for non-IT graduates.

Among the UPen program past graduates, about 1/3 become sw-engineers, about 1/3 found jobs combining IT with their previous professions. A small minority chose theoretical PhD programs.

NorthEastern has a co-op program... See the long email (update blogpost on Berea)

Kenneth felt poly would give you more personal time to explore in different directions, and help you figure out what you want to do.

Kenneth felt JC is too competitive and wouldn't bruild a broad foundation as promised. In fact, JC curriculum is deeper not broader than G7-10.

I think the huge effort (sacrifice) that each puts into the 2Y may not be worthwhile, depending on the individual.

His sister is in U-Mel's foundation program (1Y), where she could get a teaser of the various college courses. After a year, she could enroll as college freshman, a year before her cohort in JC.
There's a risk if she doesn't qualify for UMel after the program. Kenneth said worst case she may need to come back to JC. I said such a delay is normal in real life, and her 1Y would not be spent in timezone.
