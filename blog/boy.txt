--fuxi: I do have some (not infinite) spare time thanks to MLP job
for boy's math practice, baby-sitting facetime is likely to help him, until I lose my cool

--fuxi: exam scores don't mean much to my son
At some age, he would realize the importance of these scores.

At age 11 the meaning isn’t so crystal clear in his mind. It only means parents delight/anger/disappointment, and more tuition.

I hoped that he would put up with practice to avoid more practice, but does anyone do that? Practice would be seen as a very negative experience.

There’s no internal desire for the score. I don’t see the fire in him.

--fuxi: boy experiences a lot of internal resistance to math practice
I also experience the same with chin-up, stretching and coding drill

If no choice due to strict rule from dad, then not so much suffering and resistance.

Self-discipline without external help is harder.

--Kevin Chen said
confidence in math ... extremely imp. His turning point

My turning point in chinese compo is similar.

--Genn's discussion
for math, More nurturing less demanding; instead of telling him what to do, suggest to him.

Rebuild his self-esteem and confidence in math.

He doesn't show all his cards. He may have some special skills; he may feel ashamed sometimes.

Get boy to finish the toughest homework early, before dinner, to fend off the fearful math teacher.

Consider stopping the Science/Eng tuition. It is counter-productive to developing his motivation and self responsibility.

I often show my lack of confidence in his abilities , his luck, his future progress, ,, it would affect him. 

--fuxi: Chinese parenting, and Buddhism emphasizes self-restraint.
Western culture emphasizes hard driving, achievement, so I think some motivated or high-achievers have limited self-restraint

gaming is the prime example.

--fuxi: my own Eng tuition experience in 1992
The real effective effort is focused exam-prep xx and practice by myself. 
The mental focus is driven by the motivation. 
The 1H/week session is not the catalyst that helped many other students. 

For my son, since he is not motivated enough, there's basically nothing much I can do except strict punishment in the form of deprivation. 

carrot and stick short term tgt-control

--fuxi: unexpected successes ROTI with boy #peter drucker:
NTUC trips
math sheet on his own
macRitchie
jogging in stadium

--Q: what are the signs that he is giving up too early, and what are the "opposite" signs that he has tried enough but had no good clue?
A: concentration

Q: what are his signs of fatigue?
Remember I also have fatigue with many practice subjects such as trigo

--fuxi: my deep (vague) disappointment with my renzi effort was largely due to the worldly, materialistic "progress". 
No progress, then i feel zero roti. That's materialistic and impatience.

It's easy to feel love for a younger kid. Younger kids are visibly vulnerable and dependent on us the parents. Parents feel a protective instinct when we see our little kids.

It's harder to maintain the unconditional love and patience for an older kid.

--fuxi:   no subject
most of my huge effort to help boy was on the same area -- 上进， 不甘落后，克服困难，持之以恒重复练习， 不怕枯燥。

在这方面， 最有效的帮助是课外活动， 比如钢琴， 不必拿啥名次或证书， 就说他坚持到今天，没有终止，就是不可思议的进步，因为大宝的天性是非常的而不是一般的贪玩，

再比如游泳跑步，他都接受了。没有放弃。

这几项都是家长决定之后，提议坚持。 决定得对。 

除了这个方面， 我也曾帮大宝培养华文兴趣， 减肥， 没啥效果。 

--fuxi: lucky my boy is not too skinny or short
--fuxi: 5 lang of love for boy
physical gifts
quality time -- keeping company. He doesn't like to be left alone, except with a screen

Q: why does love matter in this academic benchmark race?
A: because support, family bonding ,,, outweights the crazy benchmark

--fuxi: I'm STILL trying to make dabao another tanbin
This tendency is very stubborn and subtle.

He has his own strengths, interests, hobbies, preferred way to solving problems and meeting challenges ....

I have my weaknesses, limitations, faults in my making. Over many years of "adjustment" I have come to terms with some of my limitations. Now I need to accept his limitations. 

Look at Genn. As a parent how would I accept her as she is, rather than a very poor copy of me?

--fuxi:
As a student, I found certain subjects completely boring and useless -- politics, Chinese, biology

Most of my classmates felt the same about history, and trigo

So we were not motivated to memorize or practice.

--fuxi: teach anger mgmt by calming down your own frustration

--fuxi: I asked Raymond why Malay students seldom out-perform.
Raymond is confident that IQ is not one of the factors.

He said another factor is that Malay parents have too many kids and too little spare time outside work (often 1.5 to two jobs). Jack He also said affluent families often have full time mom taking care of kids.

Raymond pointed out the hours he spends with his boys.

--fuxi: overweight consultation
I think Cigna look at the type of doctor. If we see a dietitian, Cigna will immediately suspect and probably won’t accept.

We can see a pediatric specialist first. Then ask for in-depth tests. If test too expensive, then ask Cigna first.

It’s possible that some experts have seen similar cases and have insight.
