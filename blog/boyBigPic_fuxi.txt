big idea -- behaviors that generate unpredicable rewards would quickly become habits.

Note the reward must be generated by the behavior

This is at brain level, and proven in animals too.

--fuxi: with science, his foundation is sound, much better than his math abstract thinking.
However, he is not hungry for the marks. Not focused on the marks.
Therefore, his more mature classmates have a clear advantage over him.

What's more important -- marks or concepts + curiosity?

--fuxi: 5 lang of love for boy
physical gifts
quality time -- keeping company. He doesn't like to be left alone, except with a screen

Q: why does love matter in this academic benchmark race?
A: because support, family bonding ,,, outweights the crazy benchmark

--fuxi: 温和的坚持 can help avoid creating in boy a seed of fear, hatred, self-hate 

--fuxi:   no subject
most of my huge effort to help boy was on the same area -- 上进， 不
甘落后，克服困难，持之以恒重复练习， 不怕枯燥。

在这方面， 最有效的帮助是课外活动， 比如钢琴， 不必拿啥名次或证书，
就说他坚持到今天，没有终止，就是不可思议的进步，因为大宝的天性是非常的
而不是一般的贪玩，

再比如游泳跑步，他都接受了。没有放弃。

这几项都是家长决定之后，提议坚持。 决定得对。

除了这个方面， 我也曾帮大宝培养华文兴趣， 减肥， 没啥效果。
