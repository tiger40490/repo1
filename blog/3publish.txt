freedom from ill health > healthy longevity > stamina > strong > flexible

"Freedom" includes things like immunity and karma. It is slightly more achievable and predictable than longevity.

Note longevity in poor health is not really my goal.

Strength is slightly more than muscles strength. Muscles are a low priority to me. Those (sportspeple) who gain big muscles often have a hard time with BMI in old age.

For bone health and some other elements of health, adequate muscle strength is crucial.

Fitness means slightly more than stamina. Stamina means cardio-respiratory endurance (CRE) to me. For me, fitness (and also most strengths) is measured against body weight.
