A299 where
Needed on the go? mostly for git-blogging.
The more I bring out the L36, the faster its wear-n-tear.

I tend to (over)spend too much time trying to recover some value

Imagine you have been struggling against a serious personal disadvantage in a new place, you then notice another personal disadvantage. It would look worse than it actually is. Your self-esteem (self-image) is already compromised and vulnerable before this second blow.

A few powerful examples:

eg: when I first came to SG. I struggled with English. Then I notice my age is older than my classmates.
eg: when I first came to U.S. I struggled with "status" and (mostly tech) interview. Then I notice my wife's lack of education and English skills.
