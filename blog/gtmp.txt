-- chat with Alina
The CTO is a workholic, working 10am - 1am. I see wrong priorities in that, esp. viewed at the deathbed. The company, the profit, is not an achievement considered worthwhile in the end.

I told Alina my priorities have shifted to wellness [longevity, 5/wk] as I don't need more money so badly. I think this is similar to MMM attitude.

How much is "enough money"? Remember the latency discussion, and other blogposts

Alina shared her experience about renting, and said she really wanted home ownership. I find this sentiment very strong. Those young professionals in Beijing seem to be trapped. Residential properties are pushed high by hot money. Many people probably want to avoid this "game" but they also feel renting is not sustainable not satisfactory. 

I feel U.S. culture is different. Many smart Americans (including some middle-class) stay renting long-term by choice.

== new ## tips on tag/cat naming
If a word ends in gg/tt etc and then -ing, we should drop the "-ing". For example, blogg, tagg
-- category naming only
Categories are hierarchical. Some info can be inferred from the parent category and can be omitted.

Category sorting matters, esp. in the listing page, when I pick a category from the dropdown to display.

To "control" sorting, hot categories have two alternative names. For example, an1kang1/wellness would sort to top, while wellness/an1kang1 would sort to bottom.

If a category need to sort to top but lacks a good alternative name, then prefix 0, temporarily.
If a category must sort to bottom but lacks a good alternative name, then prefix x_, permanently.

-- new: places that enhances absorbency 
To enhance absorbency for study, workout etc, I need
* library, MRT or bus interchange .. I have tried this many times
* open green field at dusk like 6 - 7.30. In TPY I can't find such a field. I think the jogging track by Kallang river might work. 

TPY stadium is decent but not exactly that.

--fuxi or new: excessive blogg@@
part of my current comfortable ezlife is plenty of spare time for blogging. Satisfying, rewarding, but at the cost of tech xx pace.

A related consequence -- as I reduce online blogging, I get a growing backlog in git-blog.

These could contribute to performance drags.
