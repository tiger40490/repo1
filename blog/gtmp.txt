Inflation, recession, covid restrictions, rental decline, health decline due to aging
.. are some of the common "stressors" that don't become my stressors, because they affect many people around me.

Q: What's special about long commute? Why do I suffer so much while others don't?

-- new: when we size up a man: socioeconomic
First impression is judgment of a book by its cover. Focus in this bpost is socioeconomic strata. Let's stick within 5 elements: 

physical wellness .. 5% ==> 25% of my assessment
educated vocab/articulation/manners .. continues to be 45%
ethnicity/nationality/accent .. 50% ==> 30%, esp. with caucasians
.. citizenship is usually unknown. Here am talking about apparent nationality.

Dress .. is not a factor but often a subtle hint of education, income, and socioeconomic strata.

Among many Chinese peers like ML.J, Yang was very playful with the controllers. I just felt uncomfortable playing such a role.

When I reconnected with Li Meiqin sometimes in the early 2000s, my friend the businessman Weifeng.Xiao urged me to disclose her number to him. (WF.X had nothing to lose if he could reach out to Li.) I had to pick up the phone and call Li again.. uncomfortable!
Now, WF.X was very comfortable on the phone, but I was more comfortable writing emails. At that age, I lacked the insight, the self-knowledge to see that personality difference. I felt I must muster up courage (to call people) if I were to amount to anything... wrong judgement.

WF.X also used "distrust" as a threat "If you don't give her number to me, then it shows your distrust". It reminded me of my 1994 airticket group-buy incident when I demanded receipt before making my payment. A deeply embarrassing mistake (I could have asked for it in private.)

2022 economist: wealth gap AND income gap both increased, even in high-growth countries.

I feel many workers are struggling agaisnt rising cost in education, transport, food, utilities, and unable to save. 

I guess that their rising income is not enough to compensate for the rising costs, esp. in discretionary categories like longer and higher education, private transport, entertainment, improved nutrition, dental/skin care. These costs didn't exist in their earlier burn rate.

UChicago is the #1 university outside the east and west coasts. Here are a few more.
Northwestern
Vanderbilt
Rice

The busienss schools, law schools and medical schools have separate national rankings. UChicago has top-ranked business school and law school, both comparable to Harvard.

CalTech has a ranking advantage that in its strongest domains, there are many nobel prizes, more than in compSci, humanities.

reflections on the 92S27 reunion in May 2022

I told grandpa later on "not worth my envy: their cars, expensive homes, maids, top schools for their kids". These are often white elephants.
This is part of my emerging wisdom as an older thinking adult.

I also told grandpa that my skills are in demand, with market depth in a growing sector. 
I want to actively reduce attachment to the EPA comfort zone.

I tend to brush off my advantages in diet, workout, bonding with kids, brbr, cashflow high ground, lifelong learning.
Many of my advantages over these ex-classmates are in successE and successZ.

In whatever that matter to me, I don't feel left behind. I am getting ahead, in stealthy footsteps.

-- update bpost on commute (which one?)
Need to balance 2 priorities (3 would be max)
logistical efficiency .. printed material (without need4writing) is far more efficient than git-blogg esp. for short trips or with transfers
productivity zsms .. laptop with coding or tech QQ, or tech books 

When is best time for git-blogg? Looks like an unwanted child. Commute is a good choice, even if not the very best.
When is best time for my growing recreational books? In office and home
