-- update bpost on bachelor's life
Throughout 2018-19, and a few times during 2020-2022, I frequently mentioned my carefree ezlife to grandpa and various friends. What's special about those periods?

One explanation is the percentage of stressful days in a month.
Living as a bachelor, I have fewer demanding/challenging issues like parenting, renovation, grandparent visits,,, and I have more control over my personal time, diet,,,,

-- reflections on PEK stopover
passport: ICBC and HSBC completed quickly

* stitches x 2
* naps after lunch and at E36
* flossing x 2 during PEK->NY
* stretch .. multiple times
* cleared most of the reading materials as planned
* delayed movies until I felt too sleepy
