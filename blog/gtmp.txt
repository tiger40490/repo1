--update blogpost on self-care
what self-care t-spends (don't)work
workout -- is probably the most efficient self-care. Sometimes it lifts my mood, but this time mostly invisible self-care. I need to maintain and hopefully increase the workout.

movies with kids -- generate self-hate, though it sometimes builds some bonding

time with grandpa -- yes self-care

help grandparents with logistics -- not self-care

longer sleep than before -- need to try. Can generate guilt. Can help immunity

tech learning -- might provide some self-care

therapeutic blogging -- is my version of "meditation".

I can avoid seeing my son's misbehavior. Out of sight, out of mind.

--Many experienced wfh practitioners suggest a fixed daily routine, not working on and off throughout the day and not getting much done. I need to break up my time into half-hour chunks
Q: why I spend so many hours at work but not get enough done?
A: I may realize that I actually do finish quite a lot of work in some of those chunks.

HP laptop

--fuxi: reasons why the long PCN bike trip was challenging
1) scotching sunlight
*) MRT, buses were considered coronaviris-risky
*) parts of the terrain were unfamiliar and tough
*) no placce to sit down for refreshment
*) boy was wearing dark, without sunblock
*) constantly worried about bringing coronavirus to home
