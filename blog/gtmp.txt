-- update ... some post on carefree
Since Sep/Oct I feel my carefree ezlife is diminishing/declining/// in some strange way. It takes effort to explain it

The DIYHI created lots of conflicts, self-blame, zsms about tcost, involution.

Then kids' math exam results ..

In the grand scheme of things, these pains/unhappy episodes would pass fairly soon.
The "carefree" felt so short-lived, but hopefully, it can return soon.

Q: did I or do I still neglect anything? Let's avoid the vague or familiar answers.

Flexibility? I no longer neglect.
chin-up training? I now pay more attention. Never really "neglected"
flossing? I now pay more attention
risk of job search difficulties?

Consider a male China-born immigration lawyer , or architect, SWE, (various) designer,,,, whoc came to the U.S. at age 25. He can be competent/effective/proficient in English professionally [in office, with clients, in meetings, over phone]. However, a less-educated local American would be more fluent orally.

SG was behind HK in talent, as HK draws talents from China + the west.
Now SG is becoming more attractive than HK for many nationalities:
* SEAsia
* India
* the West
* Japan?

~~ some long-term disadvantages of sg 
vulnerable to global warming
burning oil to generate electricity
limited fresh water supply .. even though gov is working effectively on reservoirs, river cleaning, catchment
very limited scale in some job domains. For those interested in those domains, they may need to work overseas.
over-dependent on foreign workers and foreign talents
food insecurity
