Inflation, recession, covid restrictions, rental decline, health decline due to aging
.. are some of the common "stressors" that don't become my stressors, because they affect many people around me.

Q: What's special about long commute? Why do I suffer so much while others don't?

-- new: when we size up a man: socioeconomic
First impression is judgment of a book by its cover. Focus in this bpost is socioeconomic strata. Let's stick within 5 elements: 

physical wellness .. 5% ==> 25% of my assessment
educated vocab/articulation/manners .. continues to be 45%
ethnicity/nationality/accent .. 50% ==> 30%, esp. with caucasians
.. citizenship is usually unknown. Here am talking about apparent nationality.

Dress .. is not a factor but often a subtle hint of education, income, and socioeconomic strata.

Among many Chinese peers like ML.J, Yang was very playful with the controllers. I just felt uncomfortable playing such a role.

When I reconnected with Li Meiqin sometimes in the early 2000s, my friend the businessman Weifeng.Xiao urged me to disclose her number to him. (WF.X had nothing to lose if he could reach out to Li.) I had to pick up the phone and call Li again.. uncomfortable!
Now, WF.X was very comfortable on the phone, but I was more comfortable writing emails. At that age, I lacked the insight, the self-knowledge to see that personality difference. I felt I must muster up courage (to call people) if I were to amount to anything... wrong judgement.

WF.X also used "distrust" as a threat "If you don't give her number to me, then it shows your distrust". It reminded me of my 1994 airticket group-buy incident when I demanded receipt before making my payment. A deeply embarrassing mistake (I could have asked for it in private.)

Using Nobel prizes as a university ranking criteria has multiple problems.

Problem: peace prize is not as relevant as, say, a Chemistry prize, but it's unfair to leave it out completely.
Problem: many academic domains have no Nobel prize, while physics/chemistry/bioscience enjoy the limelight. 
Problem: what if a Nobel laureate is actively courted to work in various universities to boost their ranking? Should the methodology exclude any tenure of a laureate after the award?
Problem: should exclude short-term stays as students or staff .. how short?

https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/facts/lists/affiliations.php has an authoratitive list, showing the universities Nobel Laureates were affiliated with at the time of the Nobel Prize announcement. Peace and Literature should be excluded, but sometimes not

38 Harvard
24 Stanford
23 MIT
21 Berkeley
20 UChicago <-- the only powerhouse in the midwest
20 CalTech
18 Cambridge
18 Columbia
17 Princeton
13 Rockefeller University !!
11 Oxford
9 Yale

Over the years, the relative importance (name recognition of laureates) has changed across the 6 prizes, so Econs/Peace and Med laureates get more lime light than Phy/Che, which remain largely unpopular to mass media and social media.
-- new: horse riding
I don't know why many (usually white) Americans enjoy horse training and riding.
I feel it's very dangerous. Whenever you fall, there's a real probability of injury.

How does it compare to motorbike or car driving? 

I sometimes envy their enjoyment, but that enjoyment is not so important to me
, whereas the risks are.

How about keeping a dog? I think there's a real advantage -- my kids would be more confident about dogs. Dogs are quite common in the U.S.

How is yoga in comparison? Is yoga that important? I guess it motivates me to keep working on flexibility. In that way it is life-enhancing.

2022 economist: wealth gap AND income gap both increased, even in high-growth countries.

I feel many workers are struggling agaisnt rising cost in education, transport, food, utilities, and unable to save. 

I guess that their rising income is not enough to compensate for the rising costs, esp. in discretionary categories like longer and higher education, private transport, entertainment, improved nutrition, dental/skin care. These costs didn't exist in their earlier burn rate.

UChicago is the #1 university outside the east and west coasts. Here are a few more.
Northwestern
Vanderbilt
Rice

The busienss schools, law schools and medical schools have separate national rankings. UChicago has top-ranked business school and law school, both comparable to Harvard.

CalTech has a ranking advantage that in its strongest domains, there are many nobel prizes, more than in compSci, humanities.

-- slowcooking update bpost on brush-off
reflections on the 92S27 reunion in May 2022

I told grandpa later on "not worth my envy: their cars, expensive homes, maids, top schools for their kids". These are often white elephants.
This is part of my emerging wisdom as an older thinking adult.

I also told grandpa that my skills are in demand, with market depth in a growing sector. 
I want to actively reduce attachment to the EPA comfort zone.

I tend to brush off my advantages in diet, workout, bonding with kids, brbr, cashflow high ground, lifelong learning.
Many of my advantages over these ex-classmates are in successE and successZ.

In whatever that matter to me, I don't feel left behind. I am getting ahead, in stealthy footsteps.

-- LG2 new: dependency@aircon ++
I now feel slightly less guilty about my growing dependency on AC.

(Is there anything NOK to switch on/off frequently? No evidence.)

Dependency on AC is very common, so commercial support is widespread.
Dependency on car is ditto, but the commercial support is pricier.

Dependency on wireless connectivity is very common, but you depend on other people most of the time.
Dependency on wpress is uncommon
Dependency on NY/NJ subway is common during peak hours only. Extra dependency on it is uncommon.

-- update bpost on commute (which one?)
Need to balance 2 priorities (3 would be max)
logistical efficiency .. printed material (without need4writing) is far more efficient than git-blogg esp. for short trips or with transfers
productivity zsms .. laptop with coding or tech QQ, or tech books 

When is best time for git-blogg? Looks like an unwanted child. Commute is a good choice, even if not the very best.
When is best time for my growing recreational books? In office and home
