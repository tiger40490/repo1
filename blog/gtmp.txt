-- new: grades better in MSFM
In MSFM, I scored mostly A and two B's, based on exams or group assignments.

In B.Engin, I scored a few C or D.

My class cohort is stronger in ... MSFM. 

I have no reason to suspect the grading criteria to be stricter in either program.

-- update https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=41605&action=edit.. borrowed book vs bought vs free books

Borrowed books exert the highest time-pressure, even if I am allocated 6 weeks.

Purchased books generate the heaviest stress in terms of "reading minutes vs $cost". However, a bigger stressor is the carry-cost when moving home. Each time I had to go through dozens if not hundreds deciding which titles to discard. Always painful and time-consuming.

Free books are stress-free. Free magazines often show quality content esp. in the case of a global publication brand.

-- new kindness
I see myself as a kind person. Kindness is one of the G3 essential traits of a good person, a decent person, or a high-quality person. You want kind individuals in your team, in your family, in leadershi (including government).

Each thinking person's yardstick of kindness is slightly different from the mainstream yardstick.

Perhaps the most important element is kindness to family. 

Missing element in many yardksticks -- Is the person kind to himself or herself. Does she like herself?

Are you kind to your coworkers? Look at Larry vs deMunk 

For an employee on any people-facing job, I think it's easy to be kind to his customers/users, because he is trained, paid (and monitored) to do so. Negative feedback (complaints etc) is prompt, recorded, and analyzed with plenty of guidance, so he will receive plenty of "support" to correct his behavior.

In some positions (such as law enforcement), kindness is probably less important than fairness.

恶有恶报 -- one of the most powerful "laws of the universe".

I'm also a good husband. Many otherwise kind man are unfaithful.

-- new: my prejudie: China's innovation
I have a growing prejudice that China is a immitator, follower not an innovator as Americans and Europeans are.

Japan is the first Asian country to open up and reform to adopt western systems ...

拿来主义

The west also picked up many things from India, East Asian cultures...

A country too arrogant to 放下身段 and adopt other cultures will pay a price and decline.

Math (and comp science to some extent) .. China didn't invent any, but China students have very strong foundations.

-- new: hear both sides@story, or get brainwashed
Our judgement of morality, character... etc is subject to brainwash.
* eg: my son's opinion of CCP
* eg: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Catch_a_Predator
* eg: https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=6980&action=edit

We need to read the criticisms, counter arguments, both sides of the story.

Why NYU has so many alumni on WallSt, even though not a top 20 college?
Why HK has so many "top financial professionals" out of a tiny population?
Why U.S. produces most of the top basketball players, out of 4% of world population?

Answer: contexx or opportunity to develop talents.

Sg gov pick upstream domains like financial, life science, digital tech, and bring in multinationals who provide the skill-upgrading contexx to Singaporeans.

-- update progressive lens
I don't want to waste my (reusable) frames even though Cigna pays everything. It's a waste of resources, and also indirectly raises premium.

-- update bpost on glamourous women
Emily Chang was one of the most attractive women in the world -- young, bright, bold, an Asian female (and gorgeous) face in male-dominated Silicon Valley... a breath of fresh air.

Then her youthful face grew old. 
I feel more than 60% of the audience is male, and males are attracted by a youthful, pretty face.

I guess a mainstream, competitive global media power house that's the flagship of Bloomberg's entire technology franchise can't have a 40-something women as the figurehead.

-- fuxi ... or update some post on carefree
Since Sep/Oct I feel my carefree ezlife is diminishing/declining/// in some strange way. It takes effort to explain it

The DIYHI created lots of conflicts, self-blame, zsms about tcost, involution.

Then kids' math exam results ..

In the grand scheme of things, these pains/unhappy episodes would pass.
The "carefree" felt so short-lived, but hopefully, it soon returned.
