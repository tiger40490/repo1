I often prefer one-word answers, but a longer, positive answer could influence my self-image.

--update the blogpost on HF
t_fomo^livelihood
To HF, do I come across as fully satisfied, without pains, except parenting?
Clearly I didn't mention PIP.
FOMO is a shared pressure.

1) PIP, bonus, stigma, respect
2) FOLB, exclub peer comparison
3) boy's "performance"

In terms of livelihood, All my top 3 deep, recurring pains above are "superficial" i.e. not real threats to my family livelihood, largely thanks to my interview skills. But IV is the flagship of a fleet of strengths. I should also give credit to
* the dev job market and my decision to stick to it. I have key talents to thrive in it such as low cultural bias
* the WallSt contract market that I discovered and held on to
* lifelong wellness habits
* bedrock of stable marraige. I made the right choice.
* bedrock of SG citizenship providing essential protections. I made the right choice.
* my lifelong earn/save/invest and Fuller wealth strengths

My descriptions above tends to lean towards external locus of control, but in reality my personal factors are more important.

Brother printer is my most reliable printer ever. No paper jam. very slow ink depletions.

Scanner and copier also worked well. Saved many trips to the commercial shops.

--fuxi: 
debt culture, drugs, sex, gambling, are some of the extra freedom that's harmful in the U.S.

wrong-time and related temptations are tougher than saving money 

sdxq-related peer pressure is tougher than saving money on other things. 
I have 36 blogposts on t_sdxq to help myself rationalize and mellow up.

--fuxi: the mattress seller says "you spend a third of your life sleeping" so their expensive mattress is equal in value to 1/3 of your life

Actually, sleep quality depends on many things and the mattress is only 0.1% of them.

The sports shoe seller says your health is more important than wealth, but quality of shoes is really a minor factor compared to motivtion and availability of time

--fuxi jolt: I'm constantly dissatisfied with my 'burn'
* too little spare time spent on work projects, but for decades I have prioritized tech xx over GTD
* BMI not improving, but I am rather successful keeping starch intake low, delaying big meals, smoothie, raw veg, chia etc

but i tend to brush aside my jogging, the high number of hours in office, my improving attitude on boy, revived mtv for coding drill

--fuxi: consider buying a smartphone where I have full control on what apps I can uninstall. 
youtube etc are harmful to my kids, to their habits, to their eyesight...

The benefit of wechat, whatsapp etc need to be weighed against the harmful effects.

--fuxi: I explained to e-power shop boss for a long time ... long-winded
However, this is better than missing some valuable points. These secondary points I make are often important in hind sight.

By repeating myself many times, I usually come up with new content, new pointers. When I run out of fresh content, I would automatically stop.

--fuxi: mlphone bb app settings
in any bb app, hit the bb icon at bottom right -> hit gear icon on bottom left -> per-app settings

--fuxi: in old age, grandparents would deal with lack of family support partly because of an earlier chocie -- decades ago they encouraged their children to go overseas.

This is a big sacrifice made by thousands of families in China.

For the last 50 years in China, each family member chooses the city to stay, largely based on livelihood reasons. My wife and I would probably choose the U.S. or SG. My sister chose Australia. Grandparents choose Beijing.

This level of individual freedom comes at a price -- physical separation of family. 

(t_ffreelimitation) If physical contact is important to you, and if you can afford it, you would want to fly (business class) more often, take more leaves, or take lower-paying jobs to live close to grandparents.

--fuxi: when grandpa is gone then grandma would not be used to the solitude. I think she would want to live with me and my kids

--fuxi: to give more support to grandparents
both are becoming my dependents. 

identify the cycle of ineffective handling of challenges. 

Sugg: make time and create mental energy reserve by reducing the fixation on boy.
