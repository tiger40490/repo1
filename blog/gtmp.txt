-- update ... bpost on longevity? which one?
My ffree calc, my devTill70 plan, my 95 longevity target ,,, all have an implicit assumption of /adequate/ health.

Are these plans simplistic?

I think some dose of optimism is good. Positive thinking. Specific, measurable goals are better goals. 
Resilience is a foundation of this optimism. 

In my declining years, I need human support more than financial support. I feel Sgp system provides more human support. In another country, even with a million dollars, you can't get sufficient support. 
You will feel lucky/unlucky primarily due to your health and your support network, rather than pff or brank.

Still, career longevity is crucial as it provides social interaction in addition to an income stream.

-- new: livelihood shield won't fend off these"pains"
When we Struggle against or Cope with multiple /issues/, we often envy the affluent. We imagine their lives are less stressful, less frustrating, less burdened. Actually, "carefree bubble" depends on many factors such as number of dependents, amount of belongings (baggage), support network (citizenship?). However, this bpost is focused on the factor of livelihood (affluence). 

Even without livelihood issues/worries, some people (including my family-n-fiend) can feel real pains due to 
* physical pains
* psychological pains .. phobia, anxiety, depression...
* serious lack of self-discipline, or substance abuse, or addiction, in the self or a family member. Remember Biden's son.
* wasted personal potential? If livelihood fine, then the "waste" is tolerable?
* failure in love relationships (incl. non-starter)... "Affluence" doesn't meet this need.
* chronic family conflicts .. eg: me vs in-laws; between grandparents; sis vs grandpa
* injustice .. eg: See https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=24197&action=edit
* gross unfair treatment ... eg? losing a /rewarding/ job for a bitter reason like personality, or unfair dismissal

Bias of hindsight/rmSelf.. I would say a lot of times such an "event" does cause livelihood issues "for a while". Could be a few days to a few years. I guess many (rmSelf) dismiss the livelihood "stress" in hind sight, but in the midst of it the stress our xpSelf does feel non-trivial and permanent (just as covid19 felt like in 2020).

How about the retirement dream? 
* work headaches reduced, but we may miss the engagement, the purpose, the F2F interaction. I would rather stay employed in a light-duty job, and endure some non-trivial stress
* Parenting pains reduced
* family conflict may reduce due to smaller family
* no more personal potential to waste
* I may be more dependent on others
