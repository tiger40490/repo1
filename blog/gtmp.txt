Is reading about parenting (and marriage, inter-personal communications) less likely to make a real difference? Yes, blogging about personal reflections are more introspective, more personal.
-- new: speak slowly when..
when speaking to someone new
when speaking on the phone rather than face to face
when spaking about something sensitive or important

.. no one speaks too slowly. Most peopel including me speak too fast.

At GardenByTheBay fitness corner and TPY stadium, I enjoy more absorbency with boring strength training. 

Fort Caning fitness corner is so-so.

In all other fitness corners like downstairs, I feel poor absorbency.

I think key is visibility to the onlookers. 

Some gyms put workout equipments right beside a big window, so gym users are easily visible from the busy street outside. Visibility can serve as a potent motivation.
-- new: longRest->tempRecovery
More than one laptop has shown "longRest->recovery".
I had to power down for many days to get a few hours or longer recovery from a defect.

This pattern has many implications.

Periodically, we had better bring out each laptop to use for a while. This sentence is vague until I point out 1) oxidation and 2) longRest->recovery.

A slighly defective laptop (eg: A299) can be used in place of a new laptop to prolong the latter's shelf life.
-- update: each time I feel lucky cf my peers (same or different age), the trigger is usually 
* comp + benefits
* investment gains
* welfare .. quality healthcare at affordable cost (or free as in Canada)
* low tax .. wealth tax
* low inflation, strong currency
* my edu credentials .. ascent of NUS
* workload
* low stress, low politics
* moat, career longevity
* really nice wellness facilities near office or home

.. Basicaly the successC components. Similarly, each sinking exprience has a trigger event in pff, brank, double-income, academic kids, WCBA,,,

Jolt: There are more important tectonic plates, but they are harder to compare -- wellness, family harmony [marriage], long-living parents, successZ, recreations, engaging job,,,

in a 2022 nightmare, I rejoined Macq and was dismissed again. 
I did my best but again was the weakest in the team.

In hind sight, the job requirement was simply too high.
How about AshS in his CTO job? CSDoctor's job? S.Liu's job? YY.Tao's job?

If I were to benchmark myself with so-called peers, try to increase my brank, and join the exclub, I would get derailed, lose my carefree ezlife, take on lots of stress. 
If I try, could I become an architect? Not my strength.
If I try, could I become a lead developer like Ash.S? Not sure. Ash.S seems to take on too much.

At my age, I have an implicit self-conviction that most of the higher-paying positions are too stressful, with exorbitant expectation.
What I'm unsure is the salary spread. What additional income is possible? After tax, 100k/Y additional? Not worth it.

I told grandpa that my successE [carefree ezlife + harmony, based on wellness and comfortable livelihood] is rare among my cohort, not because I'm better off than them, but because I don't focus on the wrong goals.

The nightmare scenario is much more severe than CB2022

-- new: killer talent, or update bpost on personal adv
More than once I imagine that an individual is really mediocre except in one thing, and on that one thing he/she makes a comfortable living, possibly supporting a family. 
By "mediore" I mean this person is below average on many important things and barely above average on others.

celebrities are the most visible example -- commercially very successful based on one killer talent, but I have to exclude them for this characterization to be relevant to me.

Leaders [most managers] are by definition multi-talented.

I'm good at JIV, but it is simplistic (and unfair) to say I'm barely above average in my studies, wellness, pff, marriage, bonding with my kids,,

I think speed coding could be a killer talent... useful in CIV, irrelevant on the job.

How about piano teaching? Note piano skill can't provide a livelihood, but piano teaching can.
How about math tution?

-- new: Y insist on touchscreen for next laptop
Touchscreen is a proven productivity feature. 

If I don't want to pay for cpu, memory etc, then what harewre feature am I willing to pay for? Touchscreen + screen size! 

for the tiny laptop, touch-screen is less valuable
usage is usually short-duration (below 1 hour 90% of the time).

However, when using the tiny laptop in office, the touch-screen convenience might help me avoid sending emails out of MLP

-- fuxi (no good bpost name): 2nd big problem
Imagine you have been struggling against a serious personal disadvantage in a new place, you then notice another personal disadvantage. It would look worse than it actually is. Your self-esteem (self-image) is already compromised and vulnerable before this second blow.

A few powerful examples:

eg: when I first came to SG. I struggled with English. Then I notice my age is older than my classmates.
eg: when I first came to U.S. I struggled with "status" and (mostly tech) interview. Then I notice my wife's lack of education and English skills.
eg: When Satya (MSFT CEO) and wife had their first child with a problem, he took it in his stride. Then his second child also needed a lot of help, as he said in an interview.
