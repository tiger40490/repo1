-- Leave some throwaway winter clothing in Beijing? But when I come back they may be lost

-- fuxi : def@success
In the last few (up to 12) months, my subconscious definition of success has shifted from successE to successZ.
Why zqbx? It's becuase of challenges. 
I think my challenges are real, not frivolous complaints of a spoilt kid.
They require zqbx, resilient attitude and continuous effort

My aging parents.
My effort on EDyw, workout, 
my strugles in parenting 
my slowly declining productivity, but my memory shows no decline
self-doubt about my fitness for finDev job market
challenges in dhost billing, site blocking
challenges in overseas rEstate
my struggles with police reports against Jill

An element of successE is buffer/shield. (I have many bposts on these keywords .. close2heart) They protect my ezlife

eg: pay rise and big bonus didn't get me more successE ... more pressue from expectation

--fuxi: reflections on PEK stopover
passport: ICBC and HSBC completed quickly
winter clothing from Beijing .. I did /pick up/ some [socks, glove, thermal pants, jacket,,,]

Some of the jobs well done. I am (not only) "lucky" to achieve them . Few people can achieve them. :
* nursing home visit
* stitches x 2 .. needed in NYC
* naps at home after lunch, and at E36 .. cushion for the 15H ordeal
* flossing x 2 during PEK->NYC
* stretch .. multiple times
* cleared most of the reading materials, exceeding self-expectation
* delayed movies until I felt too sleepy

-- update which bpost ?
On a flight, "Less forgettable" items can still be forgotten and misplaced, due to sys1 limitations.
* passport
* laptop
* laptop cover
* bottle
* charging cables .. If you need to charge devices, do it early on the flight, and pack them up hours before landing, to reduce sys1 load.

Something to look forward to

* BMI improvement
* getting BGC title 
* more reunions with grandparents
* more math games with meimei; more cycling trips with boy
* Genepai progress despite human review effort

-- fuxi: On this trip, every time I mention Singapore, people had only good things to say, except chewing gums and car cost
I talk about Singapore as MY country (now I'm a citizen.) 
Am proud to be a Singapore citizen.

the growing book/magazine/newspaper pile presented a /baggage/, an obligation.. 

luckily, my collection are mostly free. I think this is the most effective solution to this persistent concern. 
I want to tell myself to be less possessive, to travel light, to let go more readily

-- fuxi or update bpost on magazine
Q: Is a magazine article better quality than a newspaper article on the same topic, by the same author?
magazine price per 1000 words is higher. 
magazine is printed on better paper with color graphics

-- noblog: am lucky, thank God or due to karma
my laptops have all worked fine for several months now. (All-green is unrealistic, but) no real stressor
wall fan RC malfunctioned after about 10Y... durble! I was able to find a $12 replacement.
luckily, I can get "free" wound dressing. Few SGrns (or other citizens) enjoy such treatments
