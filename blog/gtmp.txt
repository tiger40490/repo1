Current week might be one of the best times in recent months
The fact that I'm trying to find time to clear backlog in git-blogg and emails ... is a telltale sign of stable stress.

My rmSelf often remembers the covid years (till 2022?) as my best years in terms of wellness, work stress, job (not "career") security,,,
But in reality the xpSelf experienced quakes in multiple tectonic plates
* RJO months in mid 2020
* Quark project in late 2022
* boy's constipation
* EDyw struggles since Mar 2023 .. multiple devices 
* Sec3 exam fails + suicidal thoughts + conflicts
* aging parents declines .. nursing homes

When I asked Dr Leow about stress and its effect on my heart, he pointed at himself and his nurse and said everyone has stress. The implified assumption is that most stressor come from work responsibilities. (Obviously parenting, pff, self-care also generate stress.)

Why do I want so much to work till 80s? Let's focus on the work stress.
%%A: my dad...
%%A: my mom loved her job as a lecturer
%%A: I saw many old colleagues working into their 70s or 80s, under moderate stress.
%%A: I am convinced that as I transition into the last chapter of my career, work stress would moderate and decline.

-- fuxi: On 28 Feb 2024, Frank.Fu lost his job while I received a huge bonus payout, and immiediately computed my YoY asset growth (annual snap),,, I wonder what are the truly important shields that protect my livelihood high ground relative to the wider population

* in-demand profile on finDev market .. my skills are still relevant, but my age is a growing concern.
* burn rate control .. many have pointed out my strength and my advantage in this particular skill
* cpfLife compared to U.S. SSA payout
* HDB value and rental demand  ... not really dependable but better than other rental incomes
* wellness habits, wellness conditions

-- fuxi: temp jobs: 
I tend to perceive temp jobs positively, as learning.

many unlucky job seekers end up working on temp jobs. No job security, low pay, limited trec
eg: Chinese immigrants to Canada
eg: Shuo in 1997 after graduation
eg: my temp jobs in 2005
eg: many of the jobless 2023 graduates from China universities

If you don't worry about livelihood, then you can enroll in a training program instead.

-- fuxi: no_time ~= no_Absorbency
academic coaching .. requires lots of absorbency, patience
household chores .. requires absorbency and physical effort 
Affliate Marketing Program .. require s absorbency
seeking (and following) counsellor help .. requires absorbency. "Following" is classic zqbx self-improvement.
