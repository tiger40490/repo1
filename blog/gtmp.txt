-- fuxi or update bpost on successE
An element of successE is buffer/shield. (I have many bposts on these keywords .. close2heart) They protect my ezlife

eg: pay rise and big bonus didn't get me more successE ... more pressue from expectation

--fuxi: reflections on PEK stopover
passport: ICBC and HSBC completed quickly
winter clothing from Beijing .. I did /pick up/ some [socks, glove, thermal pants, jacket,,,]

Some of the jobs well done. I am (not only) "lucky" to achieve them . Few people can achieve them. :
* nursing home visit
* stitches x 2 .. needed in NYC
* naps at home after lunch, and at E36 .. cushion for the 15H ordeal
* flossing x 2 during PEK->NYC
* stretch .. multiple times
* cleared most of the reading materials, exceeding self-expectation
* delayed movies until I felt too sleepy

-- update which bpost ?
On a flight, "Less forgettable" items can still be forgotten and misplaced, due to sys1 limitations.
* passport
* laptop
* laptop cover
* bottle
* charging cables .. If you need to charge devices, do it early on the flight, and pack them up hours before landing, to reduce sys1 load.

Something to look forward to
* Japan trip, even if boy's results are not great
