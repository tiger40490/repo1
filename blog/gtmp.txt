I have a visible personal strength.

This is one reason for my carefree life now. Any freedom comes with responsibility.

--new: These annoyances can grow into stressors when my "healthcare overwhelmed". Therefore, it's best to chip them away when not under stress
* bofa credit balance cheques
* retrofitness extra charges
* tax filing
* hardware breakdowns
* repair/replace - home fixtures, electronics, 

What kinda buffer would be effective against these random stressors? 
* short commute
* evening/weekend flexible work hours
* consistent time allocated to coding drill
* consistent time allocated to jogging, yoga and strength training
* adequate rest including sleep
* plenty of paid time-off
* movies?

-- good to review my reactions to random adversities
* trespass
* credit card fraud
* overcharge on my accounts

* Do they have a beautiful wife?
* Do they have a branded degree?
* Do they have an accomplished father?
* Do they have a healthy mother?
* Do they have two lovely kids?

-- new: brank~=luxury car
What's in common between a luxury car and a brank like "Director"?
* enviable, glamorous, glorifying
* high maintenance
* can wear out quickly
* you need some minimum capacity to maintain it
* not necessarily a cashcow asset
