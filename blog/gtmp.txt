-- update ... bpost on longevity? which one?
My ffree calc, my devTill70 plan, my 95 longevity target ,,, all have an implicit assumption of /adequate/ health.

Are these plans simplistic?

I think some dose of optimism is good. Positive thinking. Specific, measurable goals are better goals. 
Resilience is a foundation of this optimism. 

In my declining years, I need human support more than financial support. I feel Sgp system provides more human support. In another country, even with a million dollars, you can't get sufficient support. 
You will feel lucky/unlucky primarily due to your health and your support network, rather than pff or brank.

Still, career longevity is crucial as it provides social interaction in addition to an income stream.

-- fuxi or update bpost on def@success
In the last few (up to 12) months, my subconscious definition of success has shifted from successE to successZ.
Why zqbx? It's becuase of challenges. 
I think my challenges are real, not frivolous complaints of a spoilt kid.
They require zqbx, resilient attitude and continuous effort
