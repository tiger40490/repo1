Ashish told me about an Indian Australian girl he dated remotely. She is overweight, but Ashish was extremely confident he could make her work out really hard and lose weight. Similarly, I was confident that I could control my kids' screen addiction, diet, exercise etc. In reality, self-regulation is overriding.

Confidence is generally a good thing, but unrealistic, naive confidence is the seed of my deep pains. Confidence about how much influence you have over a family member is usually overconfidence. Overconfidence in parenting is common.

Many parenting cliches suggest that parents have the authority to incluence (yes) and POWER (no) to control (no) their young children's behavior, habits. Well, the only things that control children are prisons and mental institutions. (In contrast, schools and hopistal wards do not have control.)

Technically, a child can refer to a grown-up child.

--starhub Two choices:
AA) wait for expiry of current contract, then renew online to start a no-contract plan
BB) accept the email offer and start new 1Y contract right away

Between AA and BB plan quotas, no difference except 15^25 GB. I don't need this data so I would prefer the flexibility in AA.
:) CND + weekend data -- same between the two choices
