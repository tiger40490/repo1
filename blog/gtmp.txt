== new 3-in-1 printers
Moving-Cartridge type is much cheaper than laser, even if you include cartridge running cost.

My priorities: 
* low-maintenance .. mostly about outages. Changing cartridge is LG2
* initial cost
* consumable cost 

-- feature: outage .. laser beats tradition, but both types hit outages including scanning.
sleep mode is an outage when I need to access the LCD and power cycle the device !
-- feature: initial cost... Traditional beats laser hands down. 
The cheaper, the less baggage
I once paid $400 for a laser printer. No regrets.

After my $100+ Brother laser model, now I must pay $250. At the same time, the traditional type is very price-competitive.
-- feature: consumable cost... laser beats traditional. This is LGlp, because I have a low "lifespan" expectation. As soon as it starts giving problem, I would want to terminate the pain and replace it. So during the short lifespan, our  consumable cost can't escalate.

A 300-page Canon cartridge (original) costs SGD30. To reduce cartridge cost, you can get a $7 refill at a Simlim shop.

A laser toner costs about SGD 40 and can print 1000+ 
-- feature: weight and size... traditional beats Laser.
Lighter models can be moved easily and mounted on a higher shelf
-- feature: dry-up .. laser beats traditional since there's no worry about "dry-up if 3M no use".

each needs a more specific theme, a sharp question

-- new: table lamps: batt/LED : vs bulb
adv: low heat.. important for SG
adv: low energy footprint
adv: power cable required only during charging. See charging tips below.
adv: for clamp lamp, batt model is displacing bulb models. So I better get used to this new model
disadvantage: can't replace bulb. I think battery is less durable than bulb
disadvatnage: less bright even for my table lamp usage.

charging restrictions:
* 24H max charge
* every 3M of disuse, charge 8 hours, perhaps in OFF mode. Protects battery life. I think 100% depletion hurts battery.

charging recommendations:
* better recharge well before battery 100% depleted

--fuxi or new: excessive blogg@@
part of my current comfortable ezlife is plenty of spare time for blogging. Satisfying, rewarding, but at the cost of tech xx pace.

A related consequence -- as I reduce online blogging, I get a growing backlog in git-blog.

These could contribute to performance drags.
