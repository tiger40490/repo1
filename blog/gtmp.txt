I told boy to analyze past mistakes. It's not fun. It takes lots of effort/absorbency. 
Most students won't "pay" enough System2 attention.
Only a small percentage of students can achieve that.

Most of the resources the counseller sent by email require effort on your own.
.. including reading, reflection .. Most individuals don't have the analytical power, the motivation, the System2 energy
All the advice received could be ignored.
Ultimately, the client (me in this case) needs better understanding of the self [priorities, limitations..] and take actions to change his perceptions, his attitude, his explanatory style, his self-talk, his habits, .. 

Therefore, introspective, reflective insight is invaluable. 

I think this counsellor really listened and he repeated his suggestion for the I-statement, including the positive I-statements. These are very direct, rather than vague.

Q: what do you need for self-care?
A: plenty of quiet time and personal space. Wife needs it too. Perhaps I can free her up once a while?
A: blogging on many topics
A: I feel the hunger for more meaningful conversations, with a real listener

Q: hypothetically, what would it look like if father-son relationship had improved sufficiently?
A: more outing trips [shopping, workout,,,]
A: more chats, like the general knowledge chats
A: If I want more physical touch but he doesn't like it, then I want him to explain it in more words. So I can learn and adjust my gestures.

If a picture is too large when added to gmail, it would mess up gmail display.

-- fuxi: disabling WindowsEventLog service has an undocumented side effect -- notification area won't show the network icon !

-- fuxi: to disable hundreds of win10 services
msconfig.exe lists hundreds of checkboxes.

These could contribute to performance drags.

Allocated column is more useful than SIZE column as it is after-Compression

-- fuxi: why do I care so much that my long emails are not "well-received"? I told myself that those mails are similar to personal diary. I also told the recipients the same.
Somehow I need to accept it even more wholeheartedly. Remember Wei.Li
