-- update stealth overtake
Are there some areas where some peers overtook me quietly?

personal investments in US stocks or property (A.Lin)
brank? Not my game.

I feel none of these examples are worthwhile. Nothing to learn. 

More diversified investment portfolio
more healthy lifestyle.
more healthy sleep timing
more patience with parenting

-- update: best example of involtion: coding drill for CIV
Can you lay flat? No I take it as a mental exercise.

Another example: HFT arms race. zero-sum game.

-- fuxi: Citrix: switch between 1^2fullScreen modes
When cursor is in either screen, try 3-finger touchpad swipe-up. You can then choose a window to show on-top in that screen. The selected window could belong to the remote or home computer

On an unrelated note, you can also try 3-finger swipe-down.. will immediately minimize all windows and reveal home computerâ€™s desktop. At this juncture a swipe-up would restore everything.

-- fuxi: when I describe my intimacy frustration, I mentioned my daughter's sleep habit and my son's habit to sleep in the living room. In my description, you could tell I'm more forgiving more tolerant of my 2 kids. In contrast, I'm more critical of wife.

I expect a lot more of her. 

-- fuxi:
Among the U.S. immigrants, probably 90% come from less wealth (mostly developing) countries. Probably below 1% come from wealthier (always small) nations like Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Singapore

-- fuxi: somehow I don't mind boy spending 5H/day on computers.
He already spends too much on phones.

phones need data 
phone screen too small

-- fuxi: median is better than mean in the presence of very large outliers.

-- fuxi: 
For kids and also adults, when we act aggressively, we need to bear in mind the different aggressive actions.

Worst category is physical (and verbal) aggression, including a small push. In Chinese schools, teachers often ask "who was the first kid to hit the other side?"

Similar to physical aggression, if a kid is angry against someone, the kid can refuse to help that someone. Depending on the context, a helping hand is often considered basic courtesy, so a refusal to help is clearly personal and a passive aggression.

Smashing and angry yelling are not in that category. These are displays of indignation, protest. These can also cross a line in the sand and become aggression, but we usually can see the transition. I feel most of the time, smashing and yelling are not aggressive.  I'm not condoing these actions, but it's important to notice the level of damage -- Smashing something expensive is still less damaging than a push or various forms of verbal aggressions.
