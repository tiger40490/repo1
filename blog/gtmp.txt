It's not obvious which stressors are beneath the current state of anxiety/depression. It takes skills, effort, practice and sys2 resources to identify those stressors. 

Sometimes my sys2 resources feel like depleted, and I choose to focus on chipping away at one of the big-rock stressors/tasks:

* math facetime, family game night, or outing with boy.. to make me feel less guilty as a father
* company projects
* DIYHI
* localSys refresh .. "direct" effort on an quadrant-II item

In the context of the R.Teo bpost (https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/46375/23copsolutions-r-teo/), these efforts are "direct" efforts. 
Other times, none of the direct efforts are appealing or effective, so I would try some diversion efforts or "biological" efforts.

-- update bpost on bachelor's life
Throughout 2018-19, and a few times during 2020-2022, I frequently mentioned my carefree ezlife to grandpa and various friends. What's special about those periods?

One explanation is the percentage of stressful days in a month.
Living as a bachelor, I have fewer demanding/challenging issues like parenting, renovation, grandparent visits,,, and I have more control over my personal time, diet,,,,

-- fuxi: some notes about our pre-Christmas meet-up
Hi Xinghe,

After talking to you, I feel lucky about my current job, my wellness, my family, despite various challenges.

Between us, a common "goal" is to work till old age.... I call it career longevity.

I feel lucky about my access to the U.S. job market which will become relevant when I lose my current job and if I can't find an acceptable replacement in Singapore. This "access" is precious and unavailable to 90% of my cohort. 

I feel teaching math/computing can be a viable second career even though I may not be talented. Teaching profession is age-friendly, enjoys stable demand, and provides social interaction (with young people) when I'm old and lonely.

I can also consider teaching older people. Perhaps yoga or aerobic exercise. Some older students feel more comfortable with teachers of their age. Yoga teachers need specific training course.

I enjoy English writing, perhaps more than I enjoy math/computing. I write English diary every day. I can also consider teaching English vocab/writing to Chinese students, though I don't have a qualification. I could consider completing a part time diploma, provided it helps me establish myself as an English teacher.

These teaching jobs are possibly better than cleaner or other unskilled laborer jobs. Nevertheless, I am open to all these jobs.

I feel you have successZ (zi qiang bu xi) and a lot of successE.

I described to you the scenario -- I follow my father's foot steps and go through the same health declines in my late 80s. I predicted that I would want to live 10 more years in "poor health". There is limited evidence but my prediction is based on some observations:
* I can see my father's vital signs are basically normal for his age -- heart, lungs, liver, kidney, cognitive functions. No physical pains as far as I know. Early stage prostate cancer was recently diagnosed and brought under control.
* He suffered poor digestion + insomnia for decades .. not deteriorating badly, but a source of distress 
* He does fall sick easily but nothing life-threatening 

Admittedly, quality of life is uneviable (perhaps miserable). Both my sister and I believe my dad's "pains" are largely pscyhological. His condition was diagnosed as depression. 

In his shoes, I would hopefully fare better. (By that, I don't mean I'm smarter.) I'm hopeful, and optimistic. I don't perceive those "twilight years" as years of suffering.

See email after Dec 2023 meet-up with XH.Fu

In the last few (up to 12) months, my subconscious definition of success has shifted from successE to successZ.
Why zqbx? It's becuase of challenges. 
I think my challenges are real, not frivolous complaints of a spoilt kid.
They require zqbx, resilient attitude and continuous effort

My struggles with my son
My aging parents.
My effort on EDyw, workout, 
my strugles in parenting 
my slowly declining productivity, but my memory shows no decline
self-doubt about my fitness for finDev job market
challenges in dhost billing, site blocking
challenges in overseas rEstate
my struggles with police reports against Jill
