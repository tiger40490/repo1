In my high school, there were a few focused self-practices that didn't create a visible advantage
* fwd bend
* hurdler's split
* basketball? I improved my drible and shooting but not enough for a competitive game.

How did I react?

How can my son learn from it?

--new: involuntary celibacy and sexual needs
Involuntary or semi-voluntary celibacy happens in army, rehab, frontier mining camps and imgrant worker dorms. 
For years until 2005 when I decided to reboot my dating "mission", I brainwashed myself, systematically for years, to believe that "my current life is complete without a sexual relation".

Once a few months, I would get a rude awakening as I come across sexy shots of respectable (not low-class) women and I confront the reality that I had an /immense/vast/ but unfulfilled and suppressed need.

It is comparable to the need (esp. of a woman) to have kids, need for long-term financial security, desire (of an obese person) for a healthy BMI, desire (of Chinese villagers) for a reputable degree...

Inevitably, I would find myself struggling to /dodge/ the question "Is my current life really complete?" Sometimes it felt like a gaping hole covered with paper in my "complete" life.

I guess a sex worker would have met my needs to some extent. Some would say the sexual need I experienced was mostly biological, but a psychologist may point out the fundamental and powerful emotional undercurrents in human sexual relations. Humans are much more than animals in their sexual relations.

when you see a boxer using only one hand, probably he has a weakness in the other hand, or he is keeping his stronger arm as reserve.

There are many examples of each.
