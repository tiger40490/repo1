I hope to provide you some critical assessment, which is probably more valuable as a "gift" from an older friend.  I for one always appreciate critical assessments, even though I don't always enjoy hearing it.
   
I think you have valid reasons to remain in middle office. It gives you an arena to demonstrate and leverage on your unique skillset (coding, quant/math, financial products and markets). 

I agree that at your age (also at my age) stability and stress are important factors. In contrast, increasing our earnings and maximizing our potential are not such a high priority as at an earlier age. Therefore, I felt your trading skill might be partially "wasted" but it's OK. In my current career path, I also waste my skills/training in quant, pre-sales, physics, Chinese etc.

I have some minor reminders on the benefits of SG citizenship over PR
* medical benefits -- hospitalization, subsidies, long-term nursing care
* CPF-life -- PR is eligible but not sure about any difference
* social safety net -- this is a broad theme of the new parliament and possibly the next government. I think this safety net is mostly tailor-made for citizens who fall on hard times.

Clearly, I see that you would have more opportunities in the U.S. but
* your preference of China passport is based on valid reasons
* your concern about discrimination in the U.S. is exaggerated but not groundless
* aging tends to tilt the cost/benefit balance against a U.S. relocation plan. As we grow older, parenting, housing, health/healthcare, stress, are growing in our priorities. I always advocated early action.
* fundamentally, as you said and as I said, neither of us need the "more opportunities" so badly. I think both of us are sitting comfortably on cash-flow high ground. No debt. High savings. No housing cost. Low healthcare cost concern thanks to medishield etc. Low inflation. Growing nonwork income. Our skills and experiences are in high-demand. Job markets for us are robust.

Beware comfort zone. 生于忧患 死于安乐。

Brother printer is my most reliable printer ever. No paper jam. very few ink depletions.

Scanner and copier also worked well. Saved many trips to the commercial shops.

The main complaint is print quality, but who cares?

debt culture, drugs, sex, gambling, are some of the extra freedom that's harmful in the U.S.

wrong-time and related temptations are tougher than saving money 

sdxq-related peer pressure is tougher than saving money on other things. 
I have 36 blogposts on t_sdxq to help myself rationalize and mellow up.

--fuxi: the mattress seller says "you spend a third of your life sleeping" so their expensive mattress is equal in value to 1/3 of your life

Actually, sleep quality depends on many things and the mattress is only 0.1% of them.

The sports shoe seller says your health is more important than wealth, but quality of shoes is really a minor factor compared to motivtion and availability of time

--fuxi jolt: I'm constantly dissatisfied with my 'burn'
* too little spare time spent on work projects, but for decades I have prioritized tech xx over GTD
* BMI not improving, but I am rather successful keeping starch intake low, delaying big meals, smoothie, raw veg, chia etc

but i tend to brush aside my jogging, the high number of hours in office, my improving attitude on boy, revived mtv for coding drill

--fuxi: consider buying a smartphone where I have full control on what apps I can uninstall. 
youtube etc are harmful to my kids, to their habits, to their eyesight...

The benefit of wechat, whatsapp etc need to be weighed against the harmful effects.

--fuxi: I explained to e-power shop boss for a long time ... long-winded
However, this is better than missing some valuable points. These secondary points I make are often important in hind sight.

By repeating myself many times, I usually come up with new content, new pointers. When I run out of fresh content, I would automatically stop.

--fuxi: mlphone bb app settings
in any bb app, hit the bb icon at bottom right -> hit gear icon on bottom left -> per-app settings

--fuxi: in old age, grandparents would deal with lack of family support partly because of an earlier chocie -- decades ago they encouraged their children to go overseas.

This is a big sacrifice made by thousands of families in China.

For the last 50 years in China, each family member chooses the city to stay, largely based on livelihood reasons. My wife and I would probably choose the U.S. or SG. My sister chose Australia. Grandparents choose Beijing.

This level of individual freedom comes at a price -- physical separation of family. 

(t_ffreelimitation) If physical contact is important to you, and if you can afford it, you would want to fly (business class) more often, take more leaves, or take lower-paying jobs to live close to grandparents.

--fuxi: when grandpa is gone then grandma would not be used to the solitude. I think she would want to live with me and my kids

--fuxi: to give more support to grandparents
both are becoming my dependents. 

identify the cycle of ineffective handling of challenges. 

Sugg: make time and create mental energy reserve by reducing the fixation on boy.
