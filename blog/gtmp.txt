-- new: 6-char PNR
A.k.a RecordLocator

If your flights involve different airlines, there are often separate PNRs for each carrier.

PNR is generated by the airline’s computer system, not by the travel agent.

Two airlines can generate the same PNR of 123ABC with no risk of confusion.

PNRs may not be recycled within 24 months.
-- update some (which?) post on carefree
Since Sep/Oct I feel my carefree ezlife is diminishing/declining/// in some strange way. It takes effort to explain it

The DIYHI created lots of conflicts, self-blame, zsms about tcost, involution.

Then in Nov, kids' math exam results ..

In the grand scheme of things, these pains/unhappy episodes would pass.
The "carefree" felt so short-lived, but it soon returned.

Then in Mar 2023, EDyw was a blow but didn't /knock me out/ of my carefree zone.

-- new: perception of SGrn  
There are shrewed/sharp, motivated/ambitious individuals from any rich or poor country. I will focus on the populous developing countries such as China and India. Some of these individuals receive a decent education in their (low-income) home country or as a foreign student in a developed country. 

How about Singaporeans? When we meet a Singaporean abroad, we often see them as not-so-sharp, but with a rather resourceful government supporting them. So some of them are lucky kids, rich kids, if not all smart kids.
These kids belong to a rich extended family -- the Sgp country.
Perception of Sgp country is more positive. I will skip the list of adjectives.

-- new: %%prejudice: China's innovation
I have a growing prejudice that China is an immitator, follower,,, not an innovator like U.S. or Europe. But consider

* 拿来主义 is positive attitude. A country too arrogant to 放下身段 and learn from other cultures will pay a big price over the long run and decline.
* Japan is the first Asian country to open up and reform to adopt western systems ...
* Korea, Taiwan,,,, try very hard to innovate but aren't more successful than China. 
* The west also picked up many things from India, middle east, and East Asian cultures...

Math (and comp science to some extent) .. China didn't invent any, but China students have very strong foundations.

Whenever someone makes a proposition and says it is scientifically proven, we can ask 

Q: Who proved it? 
Q: Are they scientists in this domain? (Credentials?)
Q: Is the result/data peer-reviewed? 
Q: Who are those peers?

I think in social sciences including psychology, peer review is even more important than in natural sciences, where experiments are applicable

Why NYU has so many alumni on WallSt, even though not a top 20 college?
Why U.S. produces most of the top basketball players, out of 4% of world population?
Why such a high concentration of Nobel Econs prizes in UChicago, Harvard and MIT? These universities are the tip of the forefront.
The 5 English speaking countries add up to below 400M population, but why they produce so many global movie stars?

Answer: contexx or opportunity to develop talents.

Sg gov pick upstream domains like financial, life science, digital tech, and bring in multinationals who provide the skill-upgrading contexx to Singaporeans.
