-- topics to discuss with XA.S
me: In the U.S. I was told that many people go back to college in their 30s, when they decide what they want to study. I feel that's more natural for many individuals.
XA feels it's not easy in SG. If a guy doesn't attend college, he is likely to marry early. After marriage, he would get a flat and take on a loan. (Many would take a car loan.) The loan create a financial burden that rules out full-time study in his 30s.

XA moved into people mgmt in recent months. The team is like post-sales professional service, including Oracle and Mysql DBA. Relaxed job? No. Too many expectations including revenue 

me: learning new tech, beyond java/c++ .. I have refused to take up new languages, or javascript etc
XA took some Coursera certificates on some AI topics. XA thinks javascript frameworks market value is usually rather low.

XA feels some niche tech skills can be in demand for decades such as cobol. Young developers won't be interested or get the experience.

%%Q: what's your coding interview experience. 
A: only once a few years ago. XA has moved out of dev roles. He was a tuning expert for Weblogic, JVM etc.

%%Q (minor): what do you say about continuous coding drill
A: yes needed. On-the-job practice is too light too easy.

%%Q: screen time control?
A: be more lenient. Screen restriction could lead to mental breakdown.

%%Q: how is online affiliate marketing as a recreation esp. when I grow old
A: yes can reduce loneliness. Online shopping is growing indeed.

%%Q (minor): outsourcing in SG tech .. still your concern? web2.0 is bucking the trend
A: finance sector is more niche. SG is an outsourcing destination for American banks.
A: Pandemic has reduced the oursourcing concern among Singaporeans.

Allocated column is more useful than SIZE column as it is after-Compression

-- fuxi: why do I care so much that my long emails are not "well-received"? I told myself that those mails are similar to personal diary. I also told the recipients the same.
Somehow I need to accept it even more wholeheartedly. Remember Wei.Li
