Q: given our cashflow high(er) ground, how do I spend a bit more to reduce my stress?

capture late-night power surge and go home by taxi
tuition for kids
more lavish rewards to induce boy's better beahvior, and buy me some stress relief
pay $1k for an IT contractor to set up non-SSL and blog printing service for me. I simply have no bandwidth for now.
food delivery ..
taxi .. less effective for "stress"
fitness instructor
fitness classes
KondoKo assistance
GEX for after-sales assistance

If you don't worry about livelihood, then you can enroll in a training program instead.

Affliate Marketing Program .. require s absorbency
seeking (and following) counsellor help .. requires absorbency. "Following" is classic zqbx self-improvement.
