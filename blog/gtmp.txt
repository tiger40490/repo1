-- Q: how do I feel good about my personal progress again?. Question is sticky but not very sharp. 

The burn defining features [materialistic gain + self-discipline ] are fundamental. Note my absorbency is a scarce resource.

BMI is the best type of tough goal -- measurable, easy to monitor, strategic leverage. BMI is my #1 goal
[E] chin-up .. kinda measurable. 
[D] stretching .. less measurable. But I can target 1 minute/day
[C=decent] weekly workout frq .. improving. Targets are well-chosen.
[D] coding drill and QQ is now a LGlp.
[C+] IV competitiveness .. well-maintained

I tend to focus on the room4improvement, subconscioussly motivating myself. Sometimes want to highlight the positive

memory aging .. better than feared
sexual health
[B+] career and job security 
[A-] NAV is growing at a steady pace, hitting my targets
[A-] salary .. well-maintained, much better than feared. I now care less about exclub. By livelihood target, salary is A++++.
[A+] work/life balance, commute ... much better than before.
[A] brbr is ... well-maintained.
[B] stock picking is enjoyable, not tough burn. Targets are LGlp. 

-- challenge of chin-up target
A realistic goal would be one a day, but such a goal doens't generate positive feedback. 

I remember my yoga goal was one minute a day. I managed to change my perception to feel good about it.

For chin-up, I need the same change of perception.

I guess it's unnecessary risk to authorize a lage variety.

--update blogpost ... steadfast focus
part of my current comfortable ezlife is plenty of spare time for blogging. Satisfying, rewarding, but at the cost of tech xx pace.

-- fuxi: somehow I don't mind boy spending 5H/day on computers.
He already spends too much on phones.
phones are more addictive than computers.
phones need data 
phone screen too small

-- fuxi: y so few of my peers have a top college degree.
In their 20's, very few could get a scholarship to a branded college, so they have to settle for a lower-tier.
After a certain age, a very low single-digit percentage would see enough justification for the high cost of a branded degree. 

Most of the Chinese peers already had a postgrad degree in their 20's. Hard to justify another postgrad degree. 

If they were unable to earn a branded degree, then I think that's one reason why so many of them have unrealistic evaluations of a branded degree.

-- new: play`down my superiority
(a good title is hard)
for decades, I tend to practice a slightly excessive form of modesty, /bordering on/ self-degradation. 
Opening example: I have worked my ass off to improve diet and BMI, but when I meet a OC-effective guy, or a humerous/witty guy, I often ignore my BMI advantage and regard him as superior.

If I can recall and name 50 "superiors" [], 95% of them would have some serious inferiority such that I would hesitate to trade places with him.

inferior: Many of them (or their kids) grew up in an incomplete (if not broken) family. Many of them lost a parent fairly early.
inferior: More than half of them are overweight.
inferior: Many of them have more health issues than I have.
inferior: Many of them have non-trivial but hidden issues in mental well-being, including sleep, relationships, stress, aggression
Most of those occupying higher positions have work stress and career risks far more than I have as a contractor.
inferior: Most of those high-flyers don't have my career longevity. This is another "battery" I have built over decades but I tend to dismiss, esp. when I meet some high-flyer who is without this longevity but... superior ?! 
inferior: Most of them have long-term financial concerns like medical + inflation, retirement income.
Some of them have no kids.

.. library
From my early 20s till early 30's, probably after NUS, I often felt inferior to some in my cohort -- technopreneurs, the OC-effective young managers, the young MBAs, CFAs/CPAs, the finance professionals, sales/trading professionals in rEstate, insurance, car,, ... 
In SG, the blue-collar engineer has a low status compared to in the U.S. 
I felt like an ugly duckling, esp. in the dating game. None of the role models in the media or in the community was a programmer.

In the library, I would read tech books all day long, and those young men don't need to read that much. They would read business or magazines, even newspapers. 

Some of them read about rEstate or stocks, as they have an early start on personal finance. I could only watch on the sideline. (Now I am ahead of my cohort on personal finance.)

I think my 5-10 years of self-study was charging my batteries, or building my infrstructure.

technology industry, esp. software dev profession has grown more important, more valuable in the national economies not only in the U.S. but notably in China. 
U.S. tech profession offers excellent market depth, better than many of those professions.
I underestimated the $value of my QQ capacity, absorbency,,,
I overestimated the value of their professional skills and people skills.

Q: When did I overtake the bulk of them? (Clearly, some are still ahead but at my age I don't strive to close the gap.)
A: perhaps during q3sg

Schopenhauer : "The capacity to be alone is one of the most distinctive marks of a high intellectual being."

Many depend on other people or service providers to keep them /entaintained/ and engaged.

writing, painting, sculpture, music-making, reading, some singing (in my experience) .. is solitary. My long emails are semi-solitary. Social media apps are not.

retirement .. solitude is valuable. Physical self-reliance is probably the foundation.

Stay Connected in bad times like covid19

Many Buddhists advocate detachment, self-reliance and the impermanence of close relationships.

-- fuxi: 
For kids and also adults, when we act aggressively, we need to bear in mind the different aggressive actions.

Worst category is physical (and verbal) aggression, including a small push. In Chinese schools, teachers often ask "who was the first kid to hit the other side?"

Similar to physical aggression, if a kid is angry against someone, the kid can refuse to help that someone. Depending on the context, a helping hand is often considered basic courtesy, so a refusal to help is clearly personal and a passive aggression.

Smashing and angry yelling are not in that category. These are displays of indignation, protest. These can also cross a line in the sand and become aggression, but we usually can see the transition. I feel most of the time, smashing and yelling are not aggressive.  I'm not condoing these actions, but it's important to notice the level of damage -- Smashing something expensive is still less damaging than a push or various forms of verbal aggressions.
