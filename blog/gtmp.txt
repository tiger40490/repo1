Many items are optimization issues [improving from merely "acceptable" to more optimal]

BMI
sleep timing not improving
risk capital increment still too slow? Not a dissatisfaction
too many movies? Not a dissatisfaction. This is much better than that "home movie" situation
not standing enough? Still 1-2H a day though my intuition tells me "insufficient".

--handicap: driving vs English
Many of my friends have a handicap in English writing

Consider my MLP colleagues vs Sophia/Y.Zhang/Rong.Zhu

Oral English has a lower entry barrier so fewer friends have that handicap but consider SY.Chang, Kevin/Gary, Rong

The English handicap affects half the "community" they are in, but driving handicap affects only me.

-- update  https://vtb6drive.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=9964&action=edit

Flexibility is a handicap. Empathy was a personal handicap. English was a handicap in my earlier years in Singapore.

Driving is a personal weakness/handicap, more physical than English language handicap.

I need a much higher budget just for learning to drive. I already spent $2k+. Need to be $10k.
The vehicle doesn't have to be the strongest or "safest". I would say average safety rating is sufficient. 

I would need a "budget" for paying fines.

I also need a huge tBudget for learning and "managing" license + vehicle.

For the first 1 or 2 years, don't drive the family at all. Even in local street, you can get hit or drive off the road and hit something dangerous.

-- new: trainers targeting greed
Patrick of Gex Academy
Adam Khoo
Ewin Chia
Pauline Teo
Many of the youtube advertizers

This is a sample of the trainers in Singapore.

I feel the biggest weakness in their proposition is endless greed -- exclub/FOMO. That is a poisonous ingredient in their recipe. These trainers seem to /prey/ on this common human weankess. They never preach successE/successL, seldom successZ. 

Many of these trainers are overweight, have imperefect diet/workout habits. Despite their financial status, I don't think they have successE. They are working too hard, enslaved by their greed.

I suspect that many of them have below-average quality of marriage.

-- update post on my english..
Q: How critical was English during the early 2007 adaptation/adjustment[actually a struggle] to living in USA?

Luckily, in early 2007 my English proved adequate, thanks to the formal education in SG and on-the-job training in SG, and my years of self-practice in emails, in-depth discussions with non-Chinese friends.

From early 2007, I had no difficulty reading (any tough material) and .. listening [my traditional weakness]!

I was a fairly fluent speaker in 2007. No one said I had a strong accent like half the subcontinent coworkers, whose /oral/ English was good enough for an offshore worksite.
The Singapore/Malaysia and Hongkong accent was mild in constrast to millions of immigrants speaking English "dialects" from Eastern Europe, middle east, central Asia, S.E.Asia,,,,

In each ethnic group, some 5 to 20% [1] of the immigrants speak decent English, usually due to education, but conceivably due to everyday practice (without education) or untrained talent -- consider my sister and my wife.

[1] Among the Mexican immigrants, that percentage is lower because proportionally many of them came in without a work visa or student visa.

Q: how did my wife cope with English?

I have hitherto left out proficiency in writing. Not an "everyday" proficiency, more of an advanced skill. Challenging for most immigrants. Even native speakers (esp. the less educated) struggle with many non-trivial tasks. 
Writing is a trained skill like painting, public speaking, .... Training takes years. I was generally well-trained over the prior decades since 1991. Now in 2022, I consider myself "well-trained" when benchmarked to the average native SPEAKER.

-- update rm^xpSelf
I have blogged extensively about my sense of wellbeing [carefree ezlife; stealth overtake; not left behind on any front; ]

The rmSelf^rmSelf framework is a unique lens, but not exactly front and center to my understanding of wellbeing. Other frameworks are more relevant, such as 4 def@success, livelihood, life chances, Maslow's pyramid
-- update 4def@success
successL is mostly about the evaluative rmSelf. However, if (not when) you are in the flow of successL, your xpSelf would have a great time.

successZ can require a tough effort, self-discipline, and a punishing/painful postponement of (xpSelf's) gratification. 
In the same vein, Buddhist abstinence is a huge sacrifice by the xpSelf.. Not worth it IMO.

successE (compared to the other 3) is relatively attentive to xpSelf.

-- new: specialist foreign talent.. or update post on EP holders
SG has limited natural resources.. must maximize and compete on human capital, but the local population human capital is also limited.

Fin-IT is one HVA [high value-add] sector. Most of the qualified individuals are foreigners including Indians and Chinese. Citizens like me are perhaps 5% of the talent pool.

The HVA sectors often need talents that are lacking in the local population. Therefore, SG needs to import foreign talents to jump start those growth engines, and hope to get more locals trained in those HVA sectors.

Many of my Fin-IT foreign colleagues really like SG and want to stay here forever. If one of the foreign talens have kids growing up in SG, government hopes these kids mingle with local kids and become naturalized Singaporeans.

These same individuals often migrate to U.S., Australia, Canada, or return to home countries. Therefore, SG is engaged in a global competition for talents and their genes. 

I am one of the well-naturalized foreign talents.
-- new: discussion on HK with German
Parents face way too much pressure from schools. Even primary schools conduct admission interviews on kids and parents. I tend to dismiss this factor but it is important to some (well-qualified, internationally mobile) individuals. 

Immigrants who originally came from impoverished background probably won't complain. but their 2nd/3rd generations experience decline in livelihood (esp. housing), and complain. I told German that HK is still a wealthy city, but 
the complaint could be more than 无病呻吟.

HK Government is seen as 无能(wu2neng2)/incapable. Used to be an effective middleman negotiating with central gov and with the HK residents, but the current gov is bending towards one side only.

Driven by central gov, the HK gov introduced many changes (filling gaps in legal system). They were implmeneted too fast, not well-thought-out. The authorities don't seem to learn from mistakes.

HK is traditionally a place people came to make money. If the residents lose some freedoms but still experience improving livelihood, then protests would not gain support. I doubt democrasy is that important to HK residents.

LKY said international competition is talent competition. HK is slowly becoming just another Chinese city, and losing non-Chinese talents. At the same time, it is attracting more mainland Chinese talent but I think this is not good enough as a compensating factor. In the long run, it would lose to Shanghai.

I guess the property boom is fueled by mainland hot money, similar to Shanghai?

-- new: top xx experts of US/Japan/Germany
Link into "broad strokes" blogpost
Depending on the field, each of us tends to assume U.S. top experts are world-class in that field.

I think only 2 other countries, Japan and Germany, are universally considered leaders in virtually all fields.

Britain could be a #4.

Russia and China are perceived as less integrated into the international community
France? Not perceived as a scientific nation
Most European countries are too small in terms of population.

All other countries' experts are less trusted.

-- slow-cooking new: 2nd big problem
Imagine you have been struggling against a serious personal disadvantage in a new place, you then notice another personal disadvantage. It would look worse than it is. Your self-esteem (self-image) is already compromised and vulnerable.

eg: when I first came to SG. I struggled with English. Then I notice my age is older than my classmates.
eg: when I first came to U.S. I struggled with "status" and (mostly tech) interview. Then I notice my wife's lack of education and English skills.

No choice elsewhere, as far as we know.
The only choice we know:
* Mala board + Mala markers

How I decided to return it on Sat? 夜长梦多. 
Should have called ikea to ask about marker. We didn't have the foresight to know that some special marker exists for this surface.
On Sat, it was an easy and safe option to carry the board back and refund. Greedy algorithm.
