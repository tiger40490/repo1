-- fuxi or new: two in-depth chats[K.Hu and V.Wong]
Privacy!

tolerance of kids .. Accept the dire situation. 

If I lose this job, I could consider a PSA type of stable job, or simply retire and take up some ikigai I enjoy (what?)

I feel lucky about my sgCitizenship over HK/China citizenship [cpf, inflation]

-- fuxi: facing several mild stressors [aging parents, kids' academics, discipline,,,] I feel my pff efforts are partially helpful (glass half-full rather than half-empty).

* pff has proven a positive recreation, but not overseas rEstate .. too risky
* pff does generate alpha that contribute to a sense of pff security
* in my old age, the same positive effect could become more important
* pff is a valuable conversation topic with kids and with friends.

-- update bpost on NUS
why k.Hu chose NUS
his health condition at the time.
No scholarship
A branded college was "not worth it" at bachelor level, according to his parents. My parents also had a similar view.

-- update or new Sys1^Sys2
These two terms are increasingly widespread and therefore prone to oversimplication, just like the "EQ" concept.

sys1 and sys2 are both susceptible to biases and mistakes.
sys1 follows habits and past experiences, often subconsciously
sys1 is more emotional and less logical than sys2
sys1 is largely unconscious; sys2 is always conscious

--new: comm abilities: inferiority
When talking about communication abilities, I immediately self-identify with the "below-average" category, or worse like "damaged goods" category.
In reality, that's completely biased.

I have my limitations esp. in the office context, but that doesn't imply those labels. I have many communication abilities well above average.

My public comm is above average.

My written comm is above average.

I always have some good friends in office.

-- update... HK English standard falling 
How can it beat Shanghai, Taipei or KL?

With the exodus of non-Chinese expats, people would tend to use Chinse every day.

In the 90s/2000s, some Singapore writer hypothesized that the largest concentration of effectively-bilingual popoulation might be in Hongkong.
I think HK Chinese standard beats Sgp, but not in English.

Table mat to protect my cockpit 1 table

red 3-head charging cable .. I shifted one end to a more accessible socket, so I can easily re-plug

-- new: trust]gov system: Sgp^Chn #SAFE
SAFE has a published policy that allows each banking customer in China to withdraw up to Rmb 100k/Y from overseas ATMs.

If you withdraw R99,950 and incur R1100 fees, then do you exceed the quota?

I believe answer is No. Should be completely legit. If a Singapore system finds fault in me, I can dispute or appeal.

However, with China system, it depends. Most mainland Chinese people dare not challenge the system. It might take a lot of legwork. 

In Singapore, the government department always has a hotline if the regulation directly affects individual citizens. The hotline usually give clear answers to guide my decision (a citizen). If things don't work out as explained, I can raise a complaint (as I did many times). Within weeks they would reach out to me and address my complaint.

In China (and U.S.), the goverment department tends to be understaffed (esp. U.S.), unable to deal with 1.4 billion citizens, let alone foreigners. 

U.S. (and PRC) government hotlines are always hard to get through and often give useless answers. We have to rely on private consultants. Whatever the source of information, if we follow it but it doesn't work, then we face an uphill battle. The government department is unlikely to offer any help. You will have to jump through many, many hoops to get it resolved.

According to DJDJ legal assistance, the SAFE gov hotline is familiar with foreign passport holders taking out inheritance.

-- fuxi
Like bacteria, a virus has a physical shape, and dimension, but its "life" is an abstract concept. 

A virus has no life by itself, but exists inside a host cell. 
The closest analogy I can think of is a fertilized egg, which may develop into a fetus but is not a human yet.

-- fuxi: no_time ~= no_Absorbency
academic coaching .. requires lots of absorbency, patience
household chores .. requires absorbency and physical effort 
Affliate Marketing Program .. require s absorbency
seeking (and following) counsellor help .. requires absorbency. "Following" is classic zqbx self-improvement.

when I first came to Sg or the U.S. I felt inferior to the earlier Chinese immigrants, who are far more fluent in English.

Now I'm the "early immigrant"

-- fuxi or new: restaurant side dishes 
In most restaurants and in most side dishes [appetizer, dessert,,,], portion size is below half the portion size of a main dish, but price is usually above 70% of a standard main dish. Clearly lower value for money.

Desserts are even smaller than side dishes. 

I wonder why this high cost. I think restaurant cost is not so much on the raw material. Cost of 2x portion of a side dish is perhaps 3% higher. In contrast, main cost is probably labor cost including taking order, explaining, wash-up.
