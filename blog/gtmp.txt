-- new: specialist foreign talent.. or update post on EP holders
SG has limited natural resources.. must maximize and compete on human capital, but the local population human capital is also limited.

Fin-IT is one HVA [high value-add] sector. Most of the qualified individuals are foreigners including Indians and Chinese. Citizens like me are perhaps 5% of the talent pool.

The HVA sectors often need talents that are lacking in the local population. Therefore, SG needs to import foreign talents to jump start those growth engines, and hope to get more locals trained in those HVA sectors.

Many of my Fin-IT foreign colleagues really like SG and want to stay here forever. If one of the foreign talens have kids growing up in SG, government hopes these kids mingle with local kids and become naturalized Singaporeans.

These same individuals often migrate to U.S., Australia, Canada, or return to home countries. Therefore, SG is engaged in a global competition for talents and their genes. 

I am one of the well-naturalized foreign talents.

-- fuxi: drawing board
No choice elsewhere, as far as we know.
The only choice we know:
* Mala board + Mala markers

How I decided to return it on Sat? 夜长梦多. 
Should have called ikea to ask about marker. We didn't have the foresight to know that some special marker exists for this surface.
On Sat, it was an easy and safe option to carry the board back and refund. Greedy algorithm.
