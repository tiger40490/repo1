.. library
From my early 20s till early 30's, probably after NUS, I often felt inferior to the 20-something technopreneurs, the OC-effective young managers, the young MBAs, CFAs/CPAs, the finance professionals, the mainstreet sales/trading professionals in high-value domains like rEstate, insurance, car,, ... 
In SG, the blue-collar engineer has a low status compared to in the U.S. 
I felt like an ugly duckling, esp. in the dating game. None of the role models in the media or in the community was a programmer.

In the library, I would read tech books all day long, and those young men don't need to read that much. They would read business or magazines, even newspapers. They can also learn on youtube, but I find tech learning a bit supercial on youtube.

Some of them read about rEstate or stocks, as they have an early start on personal finance. I could only watch on the sideline.

I think my 5-10 years of self-study was charging my batteries, or building my infrstructure.

technology industry, esp. software dev profession has grown more important, more valuable in the national economies not only in the U.S. but notably in China. 
U.S. tech profession offers excellent market depth, better than many of those professions.

Schopenhauer : "The capacity to be alone is one of the most distinctive marks of a high intellectual being."

Many depend on other people or service providers to keep them /entaintained/ and engaged.

writing, painting, sculpture, music-making, reading, some singing (in my experience) .. is solitary. My long emails are semi-solitary. Social media apps are not.

retirement .. solitude is valuable. Physical self-reliance is probably the foundation.

Stay Connected in bad times like covid19

Many Buddhists advocate detachment, self-reliance and the impermanence of close relationships.

For kids and also adults, when we act aggressively, we need to bear in mind the different aggressive actions.

Worst category is physical (and verbal) aggression, including a small push. In Chinese schools, teachers often ask "who was the first kid to hit the other side?"

Similar to physical aggression, if a kid is angry against someone, the kid can refuse to help that someone. Depending on the context, a helping hand is often considered basic courtesy, so a refusal to help is clearly personal and a passive aggression.

Smashing and angry yelling are not in that category. These are displays of indignation, protest. These can also cross a line in the sand and become aggression, but we usually can see the transition. I feel most of the time, smashing and yelling are not aggressive.  I'm not condoing these actions, but it's important to notice the level of damage -- Smashing something expensive is still less damaging than a push or various forms of verbal aggressions.
