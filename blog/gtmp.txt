I read more and more respected authors describe the shared  personal reflection -- a prepared/planned journey to end  of life is a less painful, less regretful, more fulfilling journey.

One Chinese academic wrote that over the next 10 years of his life (80s), he recognized (no preoccupation) two likely adversities -- sudden death, and disabilities. (He wrote two essays about 渴望猝死 and wheelchairs.)

I tend to plan for (no fixation) job loss and income drop. Now I also plan for health decline in myself and my parents (not my wife). I think it is a good idea to think about death well before we are forced to. These topics make worthwhile discussions with friends, but might be too negative for the family.

-- new: growing richer but not happier
"Compared to the post-war era or pre-modernization era, we are substantially richer but no happier."

This is a dominant [well-agreed] observation in many countries, at both a societal and a personal level.

In contrast to satisfaction and fulfillment, "happy" is a short-term self-assessment/rating. Re hbA1c vs FPG.

I think most people won't bother to focus or reflect on everyday forgetable happiness, including those doses of delight. We need to focus our mental energy on the problems to solve. Therefore, we tend to remember our adversities [sufferings, difficulties, frustrations, setbacks, declines]. The longer we live, the more difficulties we encounter. Our happiness self-rating would tend to decline. Therefore, improving longevity tend to affect happiness rating.

Basic-healthy nutrition .. our increasing wealth makes BHN easily achievable, but in only x% of the population would BHN bring happiness.

sleep easy .. physical wealth seldom gives the individual better sleep, but granted, wealth can bring you a quiet home and flexible work hours.

isolation due to digital communication.. digital comm is a big part of economic growth, but (like many individuals), it doesn't make me happier.

Involuntary delay to retirement .. often due to poor retirement plann

More years spent taking care of sick parents? Watching their decline somehow makes me feel less happy For Them.. pessimism.

How about grandparents after selling the home? I think they would indeed get a better quality of life in the luxury retirement home. Grandma would become happier .. I choose to be optimistic for both of them.

Recalling the retro-fitness experience in the quiet town of Bayonne...
I feel wife and me might have an acceptable lifestyle. 
* government .. less able, less effective, less caring,,, We would need a big-brother employer, but as a contractor I have none.
* street safety .. tolerable
* natural hazards.. probably higher than Sgp
* brbr .. we would reduce living standard
* my income security .. might be higher. But Hey, perhaps we have already saved enough assets, even if we stop working? Am older and less ambitious than those India/China colleagues who chose U.S. over Sgp. 
* schools .. kids may have less stress but may learn less than in Sgp
* wife's friend circle .. Most fellow mothers would be white-collar.
* wife may not feel at home ... her home is Sgp
* alcohol, drugs, bullying, teenage sex .. more stressors
Overall stress level? 

-- update which bpost?
protect your phone against hackers
pattern lock ... easy to make out the pattern trace

-- update one of the bposts on forgetful
Push to 100% compliance of this rule -- always put the phone (spectacles similar) in the usual place. Each time you deviate, there's a 2% chance of leave it behind.

My rmSelf often remembers the covid years (till 2022?) as my best years in terms of wellness, work stress, cashflow high ground, job (not "career") security,,,

But in reality the xpSelf experienced quakes in multiple tectonic plates
* RJO months in mid 2020
* Quark project in late 2022
* boy's constipation
* EDyw struggles since Mar 2023 .. multiple devices 
* Sec3 exam fails + suicidal thoughts + conflicts
* aging parents declines .. nursing homes

-- fuxi or update
When I asked Dr Leow about stress and its effect on my heart, he pointed at himself and his nurse and said everyone has stress. The implified assumption is that most stressor come from work responsibilities. (Obviously parenting, pff, self-care also generate stress.)

Why do I want so much to work till 80s? Let's focus on the work stress.
%%A: my dad...
%%A: my mom loved her job as a lecturer
%%A: I saw many old colleagues working into their 70s or 80s, under moderate stress.
%%A: I am convinced that as I transition into the last chapter of my career, work stress would moderate and decline.

This one failure doesn't invalidate the 'system'

analogy -- Masks reduce Covid exposure but don't eliminate it.
analogy -- security cameras at lightrail stations are not 100% effective, but they do help with security

-- fuxi: On 28 Feb, Frank.Fu lost his job while I received a huge bonus payout, and immiediately computed my YoY asset growth (annual snap),,, I wonder what are the truly important shields that protect my livelihood high ground relative to the wider population

* in-demand profile on finDev market .. my skills are still relevant, but my age is a growing concern.
* burn rate control .. many have pointed out my strength and my advantage in this particular skill
* cpfLife compared to U.S. SSA payout
* HDB value and rental demand  ... not really dependable but better than other rental incomes
* wellness habits, wellness conditions

-- fuxi: older->better verbal communicator
This topic goes beyond the gz blog. I hope this bpost lives on.

why by and large older people tend to become better (verbal) communicators? because of daily practice and continuous learning.
The "practice" is interactive and the learning comes with immediate and continuous feedback.

Exception -- if a retiree becomes isolated he may lose his vocabulary, among other things. My dad is perhaps one case study.

Exception -- some less-used vocab may become rusty. I guess writing a dairy helps you retain vocabulary.

--fuxi: 
The nei4juan3 situation is dysfunctional, but each individual's action is actually rational.

When the 'system' is dysfunctional, perfectly rational individuals would contribute to the crazy rat race.

I told Yifei about my conscious career decisions in WallSt finDev -- I decided not to join the rat race or compete for higher salary, primarily because I don't have talent for that game. I also lack the drive.

I told Yifei about my career decisions in quant domain -- I found too many bright poeple competing for a shrinking pie (pie being profit pool). I felt it was nei4juan3 and stopped investing my time, but my initial decision to enroll was not nei4juan3, because I had the talent and I saw the potential for higher value-add, or higher utilization of my talent. Now I think this might be similar to the BAT SWE guys. They don't mind 996 or low value-add if the salary is good.

I feel lucky that I didn't need to suffer 996, but some people feel lucky that they can earn the 996 salary.

Yifei's main point -- these professionals have no better choice. The 996 nei3juan3 jobs pay really well, provide a trec, keep your skillset current, make you an eligible bachelor,,,

Yifei pointed out another factor -- I never felt insufficient earning for my livelihood. In contrast, the nei4juan3 guys had a mountain to climb -- buying a home in a Tier 1 city.

some of the weaknesses I overcame with (at least) TWICE the effort 

Chinese compo
Eng listening and oral
driving practice
swimming
cycling
yoga

-- fuxi: temp jobs: 
I tend to perceive temp jobs positively, as learning.

many unlucky job seekers end up working on temp jobs. No job security, low pay, limited trec
eg: Chinese immigrants to Canada
eg: Shuo in 1997 after graduation
eg: my temp jobs in 2005
eg: many of the jobless 2023 graduates from China universities

If you don't worry about livelihood, then you can enroll in a training program instead.

-- fuxi: no_time ~= no_Absorbency
academic coaching .. requires lots of absorbency, patience
household chores .. requires absorbency and physical effort 
Affliate Marketing Program .. require s absorbency
seeking (and following) counsellor help .. requires absorbency. "Following" is classic zqbx self-improvement.
