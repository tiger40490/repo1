-- update bpost on bachelor's life
Throughout 2018-19, and a few times during 2020-2022, I frequently mentioned my carefree ezlife to grandpa and various friends. What's special about those periods?

One explanation is the percentage of stressful days in a month.
Living as a bachelor, I have fewer demanding/challenging issues like parenting, renovation, grandparent visits,,, and I have more control over my personal time, diet,,,,
