-- slow-cooking update post on Jiang.Zhu
Jiang.Zhu is an unknown LeadEngineer figure that I last met in 1991. Both him and the Fenix CTO are largely unknown personalities, so my mental pictures of them are imagined/fabricated content fitted onto a half-skeleton.
I guess in both of them, there is still a lot of untapped potential, a lot of drive, ambition. Compared to them, I probably look lazy. 
Well, at my age whenever I look out towards the deathbed I feel those "things" are unimportant.

Similarly to my "laziness", my son may look lazy. In contrast, at age 13 I was more disciplined, more motivated, more ambitious than him. 

Consider JackZ and Raymond's situations. At my age and economic level, what endeavors are really strategic?
1) wellness lifestyle improvements like yoga, sustainable diet habits, BMI
2) dev-till-70 accu, plowback,,, including QQ and CIV
? academic parenting? No. I prioritize motivation, bonding, coaching, self-discipline
? prepare for relocation to U.S. including car ownership, burn rate control

-- new or fuxi: astra theme and its templates
"astra" theme (free) is recommended. 
Quick customizing .. templates. There are 180 templates. However, templates are highly restrictive and can be complicated, hard to change.

if you want precise control (me), then prefer non-template, and classic editor.
