--new: random list of protections
See also https://1330152open.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=15622&action=edit

This analysis may uncover some threats I perceive consciously or subconsciouly.

[c] SG citizenship -- protects against healthcare inflation, long-term nursing co, housing cost, general inflation. Some protective benfits of SG citizenship are not measured by money -- 
* protection against poor service when I'm in need of help
* protective environment for up-bringing (drug-free)
* SG government has a large past reserve to protect Singapore against many threats.
[c] good burn rate as family -- protects against many cashflow threats. 
[c] bx plans
sound education for kids -- protects against parents' worries
[w] good sleep -- protects against workload, ,,,
[w] good diet
[w] bmi greenzone
stable marriage -- is a cornerstone and protects against many threats
harmony at home
[j] WallSt contract job market -- protects against early decline of career
[j] IV competitiveness including theoretical skills
[j] English skill -- protects against job market competition from many newcomers

[j=threat of job loss or job pain]
[c=cashflow stress or distress]
[w=welness protections]

--new: G3 damages@lockdown@%%life
1) bonding with boy -- I had more frustrations, and more loss of temper
2) diet and BMI loss of control
3) loss of quiet hours for reflective blogging and self care, but now I think I can go to MRT
no family outing
sleep -- my late hours often lead to poor sleep the next morning
yoga
standing desk usage 

.. Some of the unexpected wins:
More positive perception of wife's parenting practices
jogging 
repaired many things at home
wrong-time temptation at home meal time

--new:U.S.drug culture: G5 specific strategies
* choose strict schools. Pay the price.
* Choose Chinese neighbourhood like Edison. Accept the long commute
* join a class as an older student
* protect the bond with the kids, so they open up to me when needed.
* wife stay home to keep an eye on him for a while.  During the formative years, mother has more influence than father. (If he needs constant monitoring, then consider SG.)
* recognize what we can control and accept what we can't.

#1 Biggest strategy -- parachute. When needed, be decisive to relocate back to SG. 
I would then have no doubt that I need to work in SG for several years, perhaps lower salary.
Accept that both kids could be delayed by a year or two, or consider international schools.
Philosophically, Even though every decision has consequences, we are not permanently locked into the emmigration decisions. 

-- immigration plan change
I had three j4hibernation -- 1) grandparent reunion 2) longer preschool career 3) Chinese4girl

Now there's one more j4 -- U.S. bad influence on my son, who is presumably at higher risk then other kids. I even planned for my son to complete Sec 4, then NS before going to U.S.

Therefore, my current plan calls for maximum hibernation. The chief constraint on the maximiztion is not really job loss at MLP, but rather the challenges of next jobs -- PIP, bonus humiliation, stress, ... I would have to give up my parachute.

1 maximize this hibernation for the four reasons above

New plan A:
2 if job loss, then quickly go to U.S. and start working as contractor
3 Once settled down, immediately start looking for a SG job that I feel confident about. This way is arguably better than job hunting while living in Singapore. Wife would need to quit working and hire a maid.

New Plan B:
2. if job loss, then relocate entire family to U.S.

I am overly pessimistic about my son's judgement, self-control, risk of drug influence. His self-esteem and self-confidence may go lower because of my parenting attitude.

Overprotective parenting -- bad influence in U.S. youth culture. I tend to see my son as completely vulnerable. In fact, SG environment also has bad influences... When I came to SG from China I experienced lots of stress.

I may need to accept the risk(s) of each choice. 

We control what we can control. There are many things beyond our control --- accept them.

New parachute -- If U.S. bad influence proves too bad, then relocate back to SG. 

Charter schools would offer more strict control. 

Counsellor pointed out the heavy PIP stress in my job would affect my parenting!

-- update blogpost on conducive learning environment
big part of my checklist for that environment is peer influence. 

I feel north Edison (or South Edison) might be pretty good. 

Bayonne and JC feel all right.

-- in old age, grandparents would deal with lack of family support partly because of an earlier chocie -- decades ago they encouraged their children to go overseas.

This is a big sacrifice made by thousands of families in China.

For the last 50 years in China, each family member chooses the city to stay, largely based on livelihood reasons. My wife and I would probably choose the U.S. or SG. My sister chose Australia. Grandparents choose Beijing.

This level of individual freedom comes at a price -- physical separation of family. 

(t_ffreelimitation) If physical contact is important to you, and if you can afford it, you would want to fly (business class) more often, take more leaves, or take lower-paying jobs to live close to grandparents.

-- when grandpa is gone then grandma would not be used to the solitude. I think she would want to live with me and my kids

--fuxi: to give more support to grandparents
both are becoming my dependents. 

identify the cycle of ineffective handling of challenges. 

Sugg: make time and create mental energy reserve by reducing the fixation on boy.

.. to give gp more support
physical presence a few times a day.
bring him out for a walk
talk about kids, and other common interests

gp is more isolated, with very limited emotional support network than gm

gm has more recreation including cooking and 

.. to give gm more support
i tend to give her the cold shoulder and make her feel rejected, hard. 

When she hurts I also feel the pain.

Walk away ... works better than a harsh cold shoulder.

create some warm, soft conversations to offset the cold dialogs

show appreciation for her cooking

--fuxi: relocating to U.S., am frightened by the prospect of sorting all my belongings

can start discarding stuff 12M before the move

--fuxi: y I worry about circuit-breaker extension
fear of productivity drop
fear of losing my cool with kids
fear of self-hate
fear of sustained loss of self-care private hours
fear of overall loss of control

I tend to overlook the improvements in the situation of my family and of Singapore
* improvement in MYS, the supply of Singapore's nutrition
* reduction in new cases in the community
* grandparents secured flight tickets
* I found a sustainable jogging routine

--fuxi: due to PSLE, compulsory WFH
now is the time that I need 
* reap the plowback;  spend political capital
* use rainy day reserve
* ctbz (寸土必争) in such spending

--fuxi: unbroken
HP laptop
powerline networking
mlphone
