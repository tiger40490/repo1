accept risks, not wholesale shutdown

eg: bedbugs. spraying and washing everything fabric, replacing all furniture.. doesn't buy you waterproof protection.
eg: covid lockdown. Even with full lock down, there's no such thing as riskfree.
eg: iPhone8 lock up
eg: overseas rental properties... I accept the risks rather than a blanket rejection. In any rEstate market, there's nothing riskfree.
eg: some stock investors only buy known names such as Singtel, but that doesn't protect them from capital loss. In this context, there's nothing riskfree.

--jolt: If a guy has kids, he often receives special "treatment".
This happens regardless of his financial status. 

eg: flight boarding.

This is a jolt to me, because I feel the rich parents deserve no help.

-- fuxi: What I need now is 'get away from the family', and write down or talk to Myself (more than a counsellor) about my feelings. 
Now I feel the value of the office as sanctury.
I also value the sitting area outside Koufu, without the very cold A/C
I also value the stair-climbing facilities, esp. when raining. 
I also value the spare laptops that I can bring to office, or bring to other harbors (stadium, MRT , Koufu...)

tanko asked: if healthy longevity is so important to you, what else are you doing beside diet and exercise?
I mentioned strong family bond, peaceful, robust response to adversities such as bonus stigma
Then I mentioned wife's health will be a key factor in my golden years. I might become more dependent on her as I grow older. I will learn to be more independent.

sexual health is another factor for "healthy longevity" though I didn't tell him.

人就是这样，装得久了，就装得像了；装得太像、太久，不管事实怎样，自己倒是先信了。而这当然会影响之后的决定和行为。
examples in n around me:

My kindness
My dedication to work and professionalistm
my quality mindset

-- no blog: smartTV box
It has special apps preinstalled to download internet content and play on TV.

The internet content could be youtube.. Probably not a streaming service.

Netflix is another app but requires subscription.

One-time $79 investment and you can watch many movies on your TV unlimited for life. No subscription. 

Unlimted movies will make you feel fed up sooner or later. Unconstrained indulgence would dillute the enjoyment. I'd rather buy a movie ticket each time.

when you see a boxer using only one hand, probably he has a weakness in the other hand, or he is keeping his stronger arm as reserve or as secret weapen

There are many examples of each.
