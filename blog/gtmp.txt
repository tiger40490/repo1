Are there some areas where some peers overtook me quietly?

brank? Not my game.

I feel none of these examples are worthwhile. Nothing to learn. 

More diversified investment portfolio

more patience with parenting

-- update post on magazine reading vacation
Magazines offer one of the most compelling alternatives to movies. Even more appealing than magazines is library trip, but often logistically difficult.

Any reading vacation can hit distraction. You set aside half a day with an goal of recreational learning. You browse through a few magazines but soon get distracted by attention-grabbing news with pictures. Most of the news offer low "learning" value.

At the end of the reading vacation, you have wasted half the earmarked hours. WeChatRead title (XH.Fu recommendation) used this opening scene.

This phenomenon is more severe online, and  rare with books.

.. novelty
Novelty (or expectation thereof) is an important apetizer esp. for a reading vacation.

eg: after I buy a tech book, I often leave it unopened, or hide its title from view, in order to "preserve the fresh attraction", for months. After a while, I preview the TOC and pencil-mark specific items, but refrain from reading them. This practice has mixed effect but usually (51% chance) reduces the novelty level. I think the reduction is inevitable. What we can hope is a slow reduction, rather than wipe-out of novelty level during a first browse.

eg: for a book or even a mag, the novelty can be wiped out after I read some 50% or just 10%.  Readers intuitively feel the same author ("editor" for a mag) has the same style in the unread sections. Those sections are therefore see as "likely similar" to the visited sections.

A wipe-out is significant because the entire book (or a copy of a mag) would get shelved indefinitely, even though it might have some hidden gems.

Magazines (and newspapers) have better novelty value, due to a much wider variety of content within a single edition. In this regard, best magazines include 读者, Forbes, ReadersDigest. Themed magazines offer slightly lower novelty such as tech, health or parenting mag.

Luckily, 20Y old magazines mostly retain novelty, if the topics are slow-changing. Obviously, we need to ignore the news portions therein.

--new: waste of water/energy/$ in the family
I always feel guilty about wasting water, energy or (more frequently) hard-earned money.

I still waste some, every now and then, but I don't give up and accept my wasteful acts. 99% of the people around me (mostly Chinse) don't care as much as I do. I often feel most folks simply don't care about "small" wastes. 

My family members seem to do the same. That's the reality I need to accept.

I still want to improve my own habits + my family members' habits in this regard, but I always overestimate my ability to change them. I'm stubborn in my refusal to accept that "reality". 

This is possibly at the root of endless commmunication failures. The cost is rather high in terms of harmony, family bond, and happy marriage.

ML.Jiang once told me about some classmates. A Chinese national and a Korean national living in Singapore as a couple, who spoke Japanese at home.

I was impressed.

Immediately I assumed that they speak mostly Japanese between them and their Japanese fluency is equal to their mother tongue.

Well, DaShan the Canadian in China is one in probably 1000 foreigners who speak such fluent Chinese. So to a Japanese national, both of them probably sound non-Japanese.

The less you know someone, the more you assume... Remember HY.Cai

Paramjeet Kaur was charged for her defiance towards mask-wearing regulation during circuit breaker. 

Appearing in court, she only wore mask below her nose. 

If I were the judge, I might mobilize the police force in the court to enforce the regulation. I might interpret it as contempt of court.

Well, the defendant may have a reason for passive disobdience.

How about my treatment of my son's passive disobedience?

-- fuxi: Citrix: switch between 1^2fullScreen modes
When cursor is in either screen, try 3-finger touchpad swipe-up. You can then choose a window to show on-top in that screen. The selected window could belong to the remote or home computer

On an unrelated note, you can also try 3-finger swipe-down.. will immediately minimize all windows and reveal home computer’s desktop. At this juncture a swipe-up would restore everything.
-- fuxi: when I describe my intimacy frustration, I mentioned my daughter's sleep habit and my son's habit to sleep in the living room. In my description, you could tell I'm more forgiving more tolerant of my 2 kids. In contrast, I'm more critical of wife.

I expect a lot more of her.

Focus on the room4improvement is painful. We need more realistic targets like I had with daily yoga.

In contrast, walk, jog, cycle, basketball ... require speed to be effective workout

-- new: play`down my superiority
(a good title is hard)
for decades, I tend to practice a slightly excessive form of modesty, /bordering on/ self-degradation. 
Opening example: I have worked my ass off to improve diet and BMI, but when I meet a OC-effective guy, or a humerous/witty guy, I often ignore my BMI advantage and regard him as superior.

If I can recall and name 50 "superiors" [], 95% of them would have some serious inferiority such that I would hesitate to trade places with him.

inferior: Many of them (or their kids) grew up in an incomplete (if not broken) family. Many of them lost a parent fairly early.
inferior: More than half of them are overweight.
inferior: Many of them have more health issues than I have.
inferior: Many of them have non-trivial but hidden issues in mental well-being, including sleep, relationships, stress, aggression
Most of those occupying higher positions have work stress and career risks far more than I have as a contractor.
inferior: Most of those high-flyers don't have my career longevity. This is another "battery" I have built over decades but I tend to dismiss, esp. when I meet some high-flyer who is without this longevity but... superior ?! 
inferior: Most of them have long-term financial concerns like medical + inflation, retirement income.
Some of them have no kids.

For kids and also adults, when we act aggressively, we need to bear in mind the different aggressive actions.

Worst category is physical (and verbal) aggression, including a small push. In Chinese schools, teachers often ask "who was the first kid to hit the other side?"

Similar to physical aggression, if a kid is angry against someone, the kid can refuse to help that someone. Depending on the context, a helping hand is often considered basic courtesy, so a refusal to help is clearly personal and a passive aggression.

Smashing and angry yelling are not in that category. These are displays of indignation, protest. These can also cross a line in the sand and become aggression, but we usually can see the transition. I feel most of the time, smashing and yelling are not aggressive.  I'm not condoing these actions, but it's important to notice the level of damage -- Smashing something expensive is still less damaging than a push or various forms of verbal aggressions.
