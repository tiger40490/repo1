There are several meanings of success.

-- success can mean lasting achievement, an extension of the idea of project success -- based on either a specific, objective, or measurable target.

many in my cohort still strive for power, position (brank), prestige, money, 
I have moved on. Semi-retired. kinda mellowing up. fat-n-happy.
Compared to them, I now allocate more t$ to wellness, career longevity, recreations..

-- success can mean 自强不息 about personal goals such as wellness, parenting
"Whether I like myself"

-- chat with Alina
The CTO is a workholic, working 10am - 1am. I see wrong priorities in that, esp. viewed at the deathbed. The company, the profit, is not an achievement considered worthwhile in the end.

I told Alina my priorities have shifted to wellness [longevity, 5/wk] as I don't need more money so badly. I think this is similar to MMM attitude.

How much is "enough money"? Remember the latency discussion, and other blogposts

Alina shared her experience about renting, and said she really wanted home ownership. I find this sentiment very strong. Those young professionals in Beijing seem to be trapped. Residential properties are pushed high by hot money. Many people probably want to avoid this "game" but they also feel renting is not sustainable not satisfactory. 

I feel U.S. culture is different. Many smart Americans (including some middle-class) stay renting long-term by choice.
