stress due to work (or study) is higher than stress due to parenting because work is a constant effort, with constant benchmark like a whip

ctrip is the official booking parter, but if you can book online, then should be confirmed.
中国假日网? price is low but may be unabilable, according to site owner. Try your luck!
basement not available.
no-window, small-window, big-window ... are the 3 types. I think no-window is good enough as backup for djdj

6801 9288 (ext 170) is sometimes avialable.

But have you thought of forming your contracting firm to get the banks' direct contracts without being a further sub-contracted employee of another contracting company?

That will give yourself more freedom and more earnings too. 

You can recruit younger talents to work for the contracting company you can form too.

I like this idea and replied in Jan 2025

In general, it's a good idea to book flights a few months in advance. Otherwise your choice may become limited (a nasty surprise).

If you book too far ahead, then you take on a higher risk of subsequent surprises.

Q: in hindsight, is it a best practice to book flights 10M in advance?

I find it reassuring to mark definite dates on my calendar. It gives assurance and certainty about my availability. That's valuable to grandparents and colleagues.

Mentally, I'm ready to write off the S$400 if something unforeseeable happens.

-- new: trust]gov system: Sgp^Chn #SAFE
SAFE has a published policy that entitles each banking customer in China to withdraw up to Rmb 100k/Y from overseas ATMs.

If you withdraw R99,950 and incur R1100 fees, then do you exceed the quota?

I believe answer is No. Should be completely legit. If a Singapore system finds fault in me, I can dispute or appeal.

However, with China system, it depends. Most mainland Chinese people dare not challenge the system. It might take a lot of legwork. 

In Singapore, the government department always has a hotline if the regulation directly affects individual citizens. The hotlines usually give clear answers to guide my decision (a citizen). If things don't work out as explained, I can raise a complaint (as I did many times). Within weeks they would reach out to me and address my complaint.

In China (and U.S.), the goverment department tends to be understaffed (esp. U.S.), unable to deal with 1.4 billion citizens, let alone foreigners. 

U.S. (and PRC) government hotlines are always hard to get through and often give useless answers. We have to rely on private consultants. Whatever the source of information, if we follow it but it doesn't work, then we face an uphill battle. The government department is unlikely to offer any help. You will have to jump through many, many hoops to get it resolved.

According to DJDJ legal assistance, the SAFE gov hotline is familiar with foreign passport holders taking out inheritance.
