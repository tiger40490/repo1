--be prepared for wfh:
get a big monitor
work early hours and late hours. avoid working while kids are in.
work with headphone
work downstairs or in common corridor

--update blogpost: sg ^ u.s.
mrt system maintenance is very late at night , with several months of notice 

surgical mask stockpile: no government foresight in U.S.

--update blogpost on ctbz
Most adults or young people don't monitor their burn rate, calorie-quota or regular exercise. The cumulative effect would eventually show up.

I have a visible personal strength.

This is one reason for my carefree life now. Any freedom comes with responsibility.

--new: These annoyances can grow into stressors when my "healthcare overwhelmed". Therefore, it's best to chip them away when not under stress
* bofa credit balance cheques
* retrofitness extra charges
* tax filing
* hardware breakdowns
* repair/replace - home fixtures, electronics, 

What kinda buffer would be effective against these random stressors? 
* short commute
* evening/weekend flexible work hours
* consistent time allocated to coding drill
* consistent time allocated to jogging, yoga and strength training
* adequate rest including sleep
* plenty of paid time-off
* movies?

-- good to review my reactions to random adversities
* trespass
* credit card fraud
* overcharge on my accounts

--fuxi: when I get fixated on brank I had better remember perception of reality

* Look this guy has a fancy car... but a car is a liability not an cashcow assets like div stock
* Do they have a beautiful wife?
* Do they have a branded degree?
* Do they have an accomplished father?
* Do they have a healthy mother?
* Do they have two lovely kids?

-- new: brank~=luxury car
What's in common between a luxury car and a brank like "Director"?
* enviable, glamorous, glorifying
* high maintenance
* can wear out quickly
* you need some minimum capacity to maintain it
* not necessarily a cashcow asset

at my age now, am more focused on cutting daily calories than cutting daily expenses.

belt-tightening is my traditional strength

--new: profit lock-in
when I notice a self-efficacy/aborbency/// "power surge", when I feel so powerful that I could overcome anything... I had better stop and ask myself "which tough jobs are becoming Spicy?". We had better aim to capture that power and lock in a "profit".

[15%] occasionally the wrong-time temptation becomes clearly more manageable as I feel more in control of my appetite.

[21%] Sometimes I get in the mood for localSys or company projects. Should consider camp-out.

Frequently, jogging becomes physicaly enjoyable (30%) or at least sustainable (60%). It's dangerous to expect this "peak" to last. Danger in terms of disappointment.

[25%] Sometimes coding drill gathers momentum and become sustainable on a weekly basis. Enjoyable is rarer like 5%.

[9%] Once a while my internal resistance to chin-up or yoga home-practice improves so much that I could do it on a Daily basis, but it seldom stays at that optimal level.

[19%] Sometimes my patience/capacity and ... for word problem coaching improves. This /space/ is a high-stake game, and remains highly unstable as I continue to lose grip and experience limited self-understanding. This is now the most challenging domain.

--fuxi: My mom, wife and friends used to say I don't take care of my hair, my shoes, my skin, my dress...
But look at those guys who do. These guys typically lack self-discipline and now show a belly, sluggish, affected by tabaco, alcohol,,,

Can they do 20 pull-up?

--fuxi: worst stressful period=2008-09
After boy was born, my stress profile deteriorated quickly over long and short term. T-budget strain.. heavy responsibility
I had no passive income  to supplement my salary,,, belt-tightening
My stress profile was significantly worse than 2006 in SG, despite my higher income. 

fear of job loss
I had no "multiple countries" to choose from. I fact I felt trapped and unwanted. I briefly considered quitting the U.S. returning to SG...
PIP was the main stressor
Salary was low -- actually a stressor since U.S. burn rate was much higher than in SG.
long commute from Brooklyn. Couldn't afford $2.5k rental in Jersey City.
Camp-out was a relief
java market depth as a parachute, cushion and safety net, was unavailable to me at that time.

--fuxi
when I criticize boy's unnecessary spend on fancy subway sandwich, I should remember my own "unnecessary" lunch-after-lunch.

Note boy's sandwich is relatively healthy by his standard.

I told a counselor that I would tell the 11 year old tanbin that "no one is perfect or powerful. Everyone of us is weak."

--new: micro-saving add up over 9Y
oth_risk

Majority of the people in my "home" cities waste numerous small amounts of money on a monthly basis. Over decades they "throw down the drain" a painful portion (like 10-20%) of their income.

Large number of small time-wastage is similar. Some of us feel the pain only years later when our peers make progress in their spare time or their office hours.

calorie-quota overconsumption is similar. We look back and feel the pain, sooner or later.

Among these ...., usable time is the most scarce, available up to age 60 or 55 for some.

Among these talents, the most significant (was $) is calorie-quota budgeting. It has long-term health benefits.

Among these endeavors, my success is most visible and decisive in $$, and least in time-saving

calorie-quota is a similar concept to carbon-quota. Each country each year is given a quota. If you over use then you need to borrow from the future quota.
