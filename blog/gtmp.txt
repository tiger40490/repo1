It has special apps preinstalled to download internet content and play on TV.

The internet content could be youtube.. Probably not a streaming service.

lost including misplaced .. 
damanged due to misuse ..
wear and tear .. is the best possible ending, for things like shoes, glasses.

There are many examples of each.
