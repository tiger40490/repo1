Hi Liu Shuo,

Hope your family is coping well with covid19. The hand-washing habit reminds me of a past conversion. Now I recall our last meal together, in a restaurant near your North Carolina home. Nice meal, not Chinese but some special cuisin. A few months later, over phone you revealed several observations of my "unusual habits". 
One was my habit of leaving my seat and washing my hands before the meal. 
You instructed me to imagine a team lunch where everyone including the boss has sat down. I said I would still follow my habit. 
(In recent years, I have followed this same habit in many team lunches during many jobs.)

I remember questioning you what to do given that I have a history of food poisoning due to missed hand-wash. I think you described it as a personal chocie -- if I choose to prioritize hand hygiene, then I may inadvertantly create opinions about me among coworkers and the manager, opinions that might affect my future in the company.

I said I didn't care much about such opinions. Even if I break this habit, over several months of interaction, such opinions would form sooner or later.

We all form opinions about coworkers. Some opinions are more directly related to work -- quality, efficiency.... Other opinions are subtle, sometimes I am ignorant or unconcerned.

By choice or by chance, I have not moved up in any team, but am very satisfied with my job prospect. Therefore, even though I'm ignorant or unconcerned about many opinions, I don't feel I'm paying a price. In contrast, I have paid big prices for some real mistakes.

Some habits have long-term damage, but my habit is not so bad.

relying on free commercial software service can sometimes be unsustainable -- wechat, whatsapp
In contrast, gmail/yahoomail is reliable

Ashish told me about an Indian Australian girl he dated remotely. She is overweight, but Ashish was extremely confident he could make her work out really hard and lose weight. Similarly, I was confident that I could control my kids' screen addiction, diet, exercise etc. In reality, self-regulation is overriding.

Confidence is generally a good thing, but unrealistic, naive confidence is the seed of my deep pains. Confidence about how much influence you have over a family member is usually overconfidence. Overconfidence in parenting is common.

Many parenting cliches suggest that parents have the authority to incluence (yes) and POWER (no) to control (no) their young children's behavior, habits. Well, the only things that control children are prisons and mental institutions. (In contrast, schools and hopistal wards do not have control.)

Technically, a child can refer to a grown-up child.

1) scotching sunlight
*) MRT, buses were considered coronaviris-risky
*) parts of the terrain were unfamiliar and tough
*) no placce to sit down for refreshment
