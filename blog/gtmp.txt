==== update https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/69/counting-your-own-kindness/
“Keep a log of all the kind acts you do in a particular day” — A Positive Psychology trainer  (Edgar K. Tham) mentioned this in the training hand out.

I see myself as a kind person. Kindness is one of the G3 essential traits of a respectable person, a decent person, or a high-quality person. You want kind individuals in your team, in your family.

Each thinking person's yardstick of kindness is slightly different from the mainstream yardstick.

* kind to family .. Perhaps the most important element is .. kindness to family. 
* kind to self .. Missing element in many yardksticks is the Question -- Is the person kind to the self. Does she like herself?
* kind to coworkers .. Are you kind to your coworkers? Look at Larry vs deMunk 
* kind to customers .. For an employee in any people-facing job, I think it's easy to be kind to his customers/users, because he is trained, paid (and monitored) to do so. Negative feedback (complaints etc) on unkind gestures is prompt, recorded, and analyzed with plenty of guidance, so he will receive plenty of "support" to correct his behavior.
* kind to rivals, competitors, frenemies
* kind to friends .. the easiest kindness
* kind to strangers seeking help

恶有恶报 -- one of the most powerful "karma laws of the universe" is about kindness/unkindness.

-- morality .. more strict than kindness
A leader needs moral compass, so kindness is less important.

I'm also a good husband. Many otherwise kind man are unfaithful.

In some positions (such as law enforcement), kindness is probably less important than fairness.

-- The western description of Jiang1Qing1 and other political leaders tends to pay attention to the character including unkindness.

Mao and many other communists have a respectable character.

Regardless of ideology, some personal traits are universally praised:
* courage
* loyalty
* honesty. women of her words / man of his words
* self-respect, dignity
* strong belief in a cause
* independent, critical judgement, rather than blind follower

Answer: contexx or opportunity to develop talents.

Sg gov pick upstream domains like financial, life science, digital tech, and bring in multinationals who provide the skill-upgrading contexx to Singaporeans.
