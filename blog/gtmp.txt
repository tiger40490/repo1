--update blogpost on self-care
what self-care t-spends (don't)work
workout -- is probably the most efficient self-care. Sometimes it lifts my mood, but this time mostly invisible self-care. I need to maintain and hopefully increase the workout.

movies with kids -- generate self-hate, though it sometimes builds some bonding

time with grandpa -- yes self-care

help grandparents with logistics -- not self-care

longer sleep than before -- need to try. Can generate guilt. Can help immunity

tech learning -- might provide some self-care

therapeutic blogging -- is my version of "meditation".

--sugg: Again, consider setting up a temporary work station in bedroom. Aim at 30m of quality time each day.
I can avoid seeing my son's misbehavior. Out of sight, out of mind.

*) constantly worried about bringing coronavirus to home

try to create some quiet hours in early morning, and make the best use of it

Many experienced wfh practitioners suggest a fixed daily routine, not working on and off throughout the day and not getting much done. I need to break up my time into half-hour chunks
Q: why I spend so many hours at work but not get enough done?
A: I may realize that I actually do finish quite a lot of work in some of those chunks.


--due to PSLE, compulsory WFH
now is the time that I need 
* reap the plowback;  spend political capital

* ctbz (寸土必争) in such spending
