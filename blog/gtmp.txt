Q: when would I stop working on Genepai... reaching the ceiling?
Q: when would we actually use Genepai outside the research lab? A brand new DMA epa?
Q: is the new process gonna be faster than writing TBL?

In the last few (up to 12) months, my subconscious definition of success has shifted from successE to successZ.
Why zqbx? It's becuase of challenges. 
I think my challenges are real, not frivolous complaints of a spoilt kid.
They require zqbx, resilient attitude and continuous effort

My aging parents.
My effort on EDyw, workout, 
my strugles in parenting 
my slowly declining productivity, but my memory shows no decline
self-doubt about my fitness for finDev job market
challenges in dhost billing, site blocking
challenges in overseas rEstate
my struggles with police reports against Jill

An element of successE is buffer/shield. (I have many bposts on these keywords .. close2heart) They protect my ezlife

eg: pay rise and big bonus didn't get me more successE ... more pressue from expectation

I think some of these struggles can break a person, or keep a person in working class.
Self-motivation, self-regulation, based on self-understanding can be a change agent.
Blogg and cognitive self-help can make a huge differnece in these struggles.

-- fuxi: update which bpost ?
On a flight, "Less forgettable" items can still be forgotten and misplaced, due to sys1 limitations.
* passport
* laptop
* laptop cover
* bottle
* charging cables .. If you need to charge devices, do it early on the flight, and pack them up hours before landing, to reduce sys1 load.

-- fuxi or update bpost on restore
Something to look forward to
* Japan trip, even if boy's results are not great
* decent timing at the next 5.6k
* BMI improvement
* getting BGC title 
* more reunions with grandparents
* more math games with meimei; more cycling trips with boy
* Genepai progress despite human review effort

-- fuxi: On this trip, every time I mention Singapore, people had only good things to say, except chewing gums and car cost
I talk about Singapore as MY country (now I'm a citizen.) 
Am proud to be a Singapore citizen.

the growing book/magazine/newspaper pile presented a /baggage/, an obligation.. 

luckily, my collection are mostly free. I think this is the most effective solution to this persistent concern. 
I want to tell myself to be less possessive, to travel light, to let go more readily

-- noblog: am lucky, thank God or due to karma
my laptops have all worked fine for several months now. (All-green is unrealistic, but) no real stressor
wall fan RC malfunctioned after about 10Y... durble! I was able to find a $12 replacement.
luckily, I can get "free" wound dressing. Few SGrns (or other citizens) enjoy such treatments
