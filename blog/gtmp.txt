bring to future hotels: small plastic (light) hooks to hang on wardrobe rails

-- fuxi or new: double trip to fetch phone left at home
Today I left my mobile phone at home, so I came to office and quickly decided to go back and fetch it. 
In the same situation, I used to feel bitter/resentful precisely because I focused on the negative side:
* family members unable to help me.
* I would have to pay a few dollars for commute 
* I have just arrived in office and have not done any work
* I must return to office (rather than working from home) due to a meeting [PMA walk through]
* I will miss a 3pm meeting, though I could try to dial in during my commute

Just 2 or 3 items were enough to paint the whole thing bloody.

Instead, this time I focused on the positive elements:
* my workload is low, without urgent deliverables
* my work hours are more flexible than most jobs
* my commute is rather short, with minimal walk on both ends
* I could read on the train, with a seat

This is a simple and powerful illustration of positive perception.

--new reputation of Singapore public/private colleges.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_universities_in_Singapore lists 6 "official" universities + dozens of private degree programs. The latter are joint ventures with foreign universities, such that the degree is conferred by the foreign university.

What's the #1 yardstick to guage these universities? I would say reputation. Reputation is measured in many ways. Many of them are related to quality, but it's quite possible that UniA has better quality than UniB but lower reputation. 

The new universities and private universities struggle to establish credibility/reputation, which they need in order to attract 1) students 2) employers/sponsors. 

Long history and large student intake help name recognition. Even non-positive associations can help build name recognition. A college with such a name recognition must be reasonably good to survive 100 years.

-- update college ranking
NTU engineering may be better quality in edu, and more research output than NUS engineering, but in terms of reputation, recognition, a longer history does matter.

Same for STDU engineering

HK, UK and other gov have special immigration schemes for "top 100 unversity grads". The officials in charge would reference published rankings but still control their own G100.
If your college wants to be included, then you need to be well-connected to the global network of academia.

% International students is a key factor. I think international faculty is another key factor. short-term exchange scholars too.

English (feasibility of coping without local language) is factor affecting foreign students/staff.

-- update progressive lens
I don't want to waste my (reusable) frames even though Cigna pays everything. It's a waste of resources, and also indirectly raises premium.

-- meet up Sat morning

-- update bpost on power drill + biking hazards
How does compliance risk compare? 

-- update bpost on glamourous women
Emily Chang was one of the most attractive women in the world -- young, bright, bold, an Asian female (and gorgeous) face in male-dominated Silicon Valley... a breath of fresh air.

Then her youthful face grew old. 
I feel more than 60% of the audience is male, and males are attracted by a youthful, pretty face.

I guess a mainstream, competitive global media power house that's the flagship of Bloomberg's entire technology franchise can't have a 40-something women as the figurehead.

-- fuxi ... or update some post on carefree
Since Sep/Oct I feel my carefree ezlife is diminishing/declining/// in some strange way. It takes effort to explain it

The DIYHI created lots of conflicts, self-blame, zsms about tcost, involution.

Then kids' math exam results ..

In the grand scheme of things, these pains/unhappy episodes would pass.
The "carefree" felt so short-lived, but hopefully, it soon returned.
