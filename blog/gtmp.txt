Boarding east-bound at Paya Lebar can be crowded. Bugis is slightly better but likely slower. If plenty of time, then CityHall transfer is the most comfortable and convenient.

==== new: ##peaking #
Rarely, a peak is followed by an unexpected peak, but for now I won't focus on this pattern.

Describing peaks is a form of highly subjective self-rating. I want to do it with a positive twist.

Peaks tend to come in waves. Each 3Y window tend to see some peaks. 

Q: what are some (up to 3) recent peaks?
A: joyous intimacy; tech xx absorbency; BMI profile;  

-- diversified investment? 
-- brBufferRatio
-- easy work hours/workload
Covid years are the peak

-- total comp
Probably peaking soon
ditto comp + benefits
annual bonus? Not yet peaking
-- 5/wk workout absorbency? Not yet peaking
-- jogg frequency
-- chin-up

In my 20s and earlier, I used to worry about substance addiction, as if my body can get out of control. 

I think masturbation proved that the biological needs can be overwhelming.

Now I'm nearing 50, I know my body is stable and will not get out of control. Appetite growing out of control remains the last concern.

-- new: final chat with Miles
tech stack is often older in finance than other industries.

Any warning sign before PIP? No java workload for months, but no other explicit performance advice or tip-off.

Did you take up c++ to improve your survival?  Not after Brijesh transferred to London.

I feel Miles might be standing outside and looking through the glass window, as described in https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/47739/2007-adapt-to-us/

==== update https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/69/counting-your-own-kindness/
“Keep a log of all the kind acts you do in a particular day” — A Positive Psychology trainer  (Edgar K. Tham) suggested in his training hand out.

I see myself as a kind person. Kindness is one of the G3 (top 3) essential traits of a respectable person, a decent person, or a high-quality person. You want kind individuals in your team, in your family.

Each thinking person's yardstick of kindness is slightly different from the mainstream yardstick.

* kind to family .. Perhaps the most important aspect
* kind to self .. Missing element in many yardksticks is the Question -- Is the person kind to the self. Does she like herself?
* kind to coworkers .. Are you kind to your coworkers? Look at Larry vs deMunk 
* kind to customers .. For an employee in any people-facing job, I think it's easy to be kind to his customers/users, because he is trained, paid (and monitored) to do so. Negative feedback (complaints etc) on unkind gestures is prompt, recorded, and analyzed with plenty of guidance, so he will receive plenty of "support" to correct his behavior.
* kind to rivals, competitors, frenemies
* kind to strangers seeking help

恶有恶报 -- one of the most powerful "karma laws of the universe" is about kindness/unkindness.

-- morality .. more strict than kindness
A leader needs moral compass, so kindness is less important.

I'm also a good husband but not always kind to my wife. Many otherwise kind man are unfaithful.

In some positions (such as law enforcement), kindness is probably less important than fairness.

-- The western description of Jiang1Qing1 and other political leaders tends to focus on the personal character including unkindness.

In contrast, Mao and many other communists have a respectable character.

Why NYU has so many alumni on WallSt, even though not a top 20 college?
Why U.S. produces most of the top basketball players, out of 4% of world population?
Why such a high concentration of Nobel Econs prizes in UChicago, Harvard and MIT? These universities are the tip of the forefront.
The 5 English speaking countries add up to below 400M population, but why they produce so many global movie stars?

Answer: contexx or opportunity to develop talents.

Sg gov pick upstream domains like financial, life science, digital tech, and bring in multinationals who provide the skill-upgrading contexx to Singaporeans.
