-- What I need now is 'get away from the family', and write down or talk to Myself (more than a counsellor) about my feelings. 
Now I feel the value of the office as sanctury.
I also value the sitting area outside Koufu, without the very cold A/C
I also value the stair-climbing facilities, esp. when raining. 

-- tanko vs HF.Sun
I feel both feel the pressure of livelihood. Both complained about work life balance.

Tanko also felt that cash flow can *become* a stressor esp. for his low-income brothers, even though they seem to be as frugal as Tanko. 
Tanko said they really need to be careful and avoid big mistakes.

-- new: tanko asked: if healthy longevity is so important to you, what else are you doing beside diet and exercise?
I mentioned strong family bond, 
I mentioned peaceful, robust response to adversities such as bonus stigma
Then I mentioned wife's health will be a key factor in my golden years. I will depend more on her as I grow older.

sexual health is a factor though I didn't mention.

--new: i feel not doing well on a few fronts

Here's a related, secondary question:

for most electronic and other products that we own for a number of years, 
stolen or "smashed" .. are the most painful, scary ending.
lost including misplaced .. 
damanged due to misuse ..
wear and tear .. is the best possible ending, for things like shoes, glasses.

--jolt: If a guy has kids, he often receives special "treatment".
This happens regardless of his financial status

This is a jolt to me, because I feel the rich parents deserve no help.

-- no blog: smartTV box
It has special apps preinstalled to download internet content and play on TV.

The internet content could be youtube.. Probably not a streaming service.

Netflix is another app but requires subscription.

One-time $79 investment and you can watch many movies on your TV unlimited for life. No subscription. 

Unlimted movies will make you feel fed up sooner or later. Unconstrained indulgence would dillute the enjoyment. I'd rather buy a movie ticket each time.

--fuxi
when you see a boxer using only one hand, probably he has a weakness in the other hand, or he is keeping his stronger arm as reserve.

There are many examples of each.
* java vs c++
