When Jess Lin echoed me and said "your forte in shoulder flexibility", she kinda exaggerated a bit, but there's no real misrepresentation. As yoga instructor, she knew jolly well my shoulder !

Still, I felt a slight discomfort and corrected her "not so good at shoulder".

My habit works fine in online chat, but it is too inefficient in SMS and unnecessary in verbal conversations like this.
-- new: too well-off
In 2021 I described myself as too well-off to feel the hunger for more earning power.
growing fat and happy like a happy pig.

Context was my tech learning and localSys learning energy.
-- new: simplify your life
The choices, and temptations in modern life increases distraction and risk of missteps. Therefore, steadfast focus on protecting... really benefits from simplification.

Prioritization also benefits from simplification

thick->thin is one feature of simplification esp. in theoretical learning.

.. diet .. simply focus on delaying and portion-reduction. Use a few tried-n-tested techniques like raw veg
.. exercise .. simply focus on 5 times a week. fancy equipment not needed. Variety can be good, but I don't want to depend on it.
.. top schools? simply say no.
.. career planning .. focus on dev-till-70. Not so simple but I have managed to simplify a bit.
.. eq investing .. simply focus on current income
.. smartphone addiction .. base camp is a simple concept.

--new or ..
accept risks, not wholesale shutdown

eg: bedbugs. spraying and washing everything fabric, replacing all furniture.. doesn't buy you waterproof protection.
eg: covid lockdown. Even with full lock down, there's no such thing as riskfree.
eg: iPhone8 lock up
eg: overseas rental properties... I accept the risks rather than a blanket rejection. In any rEstate market, there's nothing riskfree.
eg: some stock investors only buy known names such as Singtel, but that doesn't protect them from capital loss. In this context, there's nothing riskfree.

--jolt: If a guy has kids, he often receives special "treatment".
This happens regardless of his financial status. 

eg: flight boarding.

This is a jolt to me, because I feel the rich parents deserve no help.

-- fuxi: What I need now is 'get away from the family', and write down or talk to Myself (more than a counsellor) about my feelings. 
Now I feel the value of the office as sanctury.
I also value the sitting area outside Koufu, without the very cold A/C
I also value the stair-climbing facilities, esp. when raining. 
I also value the spare laptops that I can bring to office, or bring to other harbors (stadium, MRT , Koufu...)

-- new: No good title
tanko asked: if healthy longevity is so important to you, what else are you doing beside diet and exercise?
I mentioned strong family bond, peaceful, robust response to adversities such as bonus stigma
Then I mentioned wife's health will be a key factor in my golden years. I might become more dependent on her as I grow older. I will learn to be more independent.

sexual health is another factor for "healthy longevity" though I didn't tell him.

--fuxi: i feel not doing well on a few fronts
work proj, localSys esp. fuxi
QQ refresh, coding drill
parenting 
wellness

Here's a related, secondary question: 
Q: Which areas need the most sunshine in terms of time and laser energy?

parenting .. blogging and review
iPhone policy with boy. Better to reach agreement
wellness and essential self-care
localSys fuxi and self-learning
work proj? not for the next 2 weeks !

人就是这样，装得久了，就装得像了；装得太像、太久，不管事实怎样，自己倒是先信了。而这当然会影响之后的决定和行为。
examples in n around me:

My kindness
My dedication to work and professionalistm
my quality mindset

-- no blog: smartTV box
It has special apps preinstalled to download internet content and play on TV.

The internet content could be youtube.. Probably not a streaming service.

Netflix is another app but requires subscription.

One-time $79 investment and you can watch many movies on your TV unlimited for life. No subscription. 

Unlimted movies will make you feel fed up sooner or later. Unconstrained indulgence would dillute the enjoyment. I'd rather buy a movie ticket each time.

when you see a boxer using only one hand, probably he has a weakness in the other hand, or he is keeping his stronger arm as reserve or as secret weapen

There are many examples of each.
