--update blogposts on hib: immigration plan change
I had three j4hibernation -- 1) grandparent reunion 2) longer preschool career 3) Chinese4girl

Now there's one more j4 -- U.S. bad influence on my son, who is presumably at higher risk then other kids. I even planned for my son to complete Sec 4, then NS before going to U.S.

Therefore, my current plan calls for maximum hibernation. The chief constraint on the maximiztion is not really job loss at MLP, but rather the challenges of next jobs -- PIP, bonus humiliation, stress, ... I would have to give up my parachute.

New plans: 
1 maximize this hibernation for the four reasons above

New plan A:
2 if job loss, then quickly go to U.S. and start working as contractor
3 Once settled down, immediately start looking for a SG job that I feel confident about. This way is arguably better than job hunting while living in Singapore. Wife would need to quit working and hire a maid.

New Plan B:
2. if job loss, then relocate entire family to U.S.

I am overly pessimistic about my son's judgement, self-control, risk of drug influence. His self-esteem and self-confidence may go lower because of my parenting attitude.

Overprotective parenting -- bad influence in U.S. youth culture. I tend to see my son as completely vulnerable. In fact, SG environment also has bad influences... When I came to SG from China I experienced lots of stress.

I may need to accept the risk(s) of each choice. 

Counsellor pointed out the heavy PIP stress in my job would affect my parenting!

--fuxi: in old age, grandparents would deal with lack of family support partly because of an earlier chocie -- decades ago they encouraged their children to go overseas.

This is a big sacrifice made by thousands of families in China.

For the last 50 years in China, each family member chooses the city to stay, largely based on livelihood reasons. My wife and I would probably choose the U.S. or SG. My sister chose Australia. Grandparents choose Beijing.

This level of individual freedom comes at a price -- physical separation of family. 

(t_ffreelimitation) If physical contact is important to you, and if you can afford it, you would want to fly (business class) more often, take more leaves, or take lower-paying jobs to live close to grandparents.

-- when grandpa is gone then grandma would not be used to the solitude. I think she would want to live with me and my kids

--fuxi: to give more support to grandparents
both are becoming my dependents. 

identify the cycle of ineffective handling of challenges. 

Sugg: make time and create mental energy reserve by reducing the fixation on boy.

.. to give gm more support
i tend to give her the cold shoulder and make her feel rejected, hard. 

When she hurts I also feel the pain.

Walk away ... works better than a harsh cold shoulder.

create some warm, soft conversations to offset the cold dialogs

show appreciation for her cooking
