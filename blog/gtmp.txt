many countries claim to a "silicon valley", but the global tech competition has a singular center of gravity for talent. 
The U.S. silicon valley leads the field with superior track record and ecosystem.

-- new: too many items: create folders
Usage sites: smartphone/PC desktop icons; browser bookmarks; recoll

The folder is usually opaque (except smartphone). I often fail to recall which folder hosts a particula item. 

Sugg: folder name had better be suggestive.

Sugg: try symlinks/shortcuts. Two copies of the same shortcut can go into two folders.

Americans, Mainland Chinese... receive less support from the state. "You are on your own." they were told. Such a message is rarely given to SG citizens. Sg citizens are often reliant on the state. I guess this is similar to other small nations like Finland, Norway,,,, 

The reliance is evident in many diverse domains.

However, Singaporeans as a whole is a fairly resilient nation, as shown in numerous crises [covid, SARS, 1997AFC...]. We are resilient in spite or because of our reliance on each other. 

Same can be said of a family. Kids rely on parents. Siblings lean on each other. 

I guess a small school, a small company are like small nations -- tight-knit group. A larger company can also provide adequate employee support, esp. in the U.S. but this level of company internal suppport can cost a lot to the employer.

There are individuals who don't need to rely on others. They appear to be resilient in the lone wolf sense, but I don't know how common they are, or how strong they actually are. 
I guess in most cases, resilient people tap on a "support network" rather than act as lone wolves. 

One of the most intimate illustrations is counselling, like sexual issues, phobias, obsessions, addictions, behavior issues. Optimism (in the Lone-wolf sense) is just a word, often a weak and ineffective word by itself. Positive thinking is .. ditto. In half the non-trivial cases, the individual needs guidance and a helping hand.

Among many Chinese peers like ML.J, Yang was very playful with the controllers, all of them China girls. I just felt uncomfortable playing such a role.

When I reconnected with Li Meiqin sometimes in the early 2000s, my friend the businessman Weifeng.Xiao urged me to disclose her number to him. (WF.X had nothing to lose.) I had to pick up the phone and call Li again.. uncomfortable!
Now, WF.X was very comfortable on the phone, but I was more comfortable writing emails. At that age, I lacked the insight, the self-knowledge to see that personality difference. I felt I must muster up courage (to call people) if I were to amount to anything... wrong perception, wrong judgement.

WF.X also used "distrust" as a threat "If you don't give her number to me, then it shows your distrust". Actually, it's nothing to do with trust! If a dying patient told her doctor not to reveal something to her surviving family, and the doctor agreed, then he has to keep his promise. Nothing to do with trust for her family.
