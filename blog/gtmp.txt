-- update bpost on effective endeavor
other effective interventions #unexpected

Throughout my career and family-building in Sg and US, my personal strategy [decisions, plann/executions, adjustments] about car ownership is .. surprisingly effective. 

Most of my peers "need" a car. They give various explanations of personal needs. It sounds like "so hard to cope without a car in this (part of) country", but I think what they mean is "Since I can afford [1] (to lease) a car, it is proving extremely convenient."

Many point to their own work/home locations, but hey, look at my choice of locations. I chose them to minimize car dependency.

[1] Affordability is personal. I can afford so I do fly up to 4/year for family reunion. Not essential, but a personal priority.

I did spend about USD 1k twice learning to drive. In 2018/19 I also practiced with zipcar. That's part of my effective endeavor.

-- new: livelihood shield won't fend off these"pains"
When we Struggle against or Cope with multiple /issues/, we often envy the affluent. We imagine their lives are less stressful, less frustrating, less burdened. Actually, "carefree bubble" depends on many factors such as number of dependents, amount of belongings (baggage), support network (citizenship?). However, this bpost is focused on the factor of livelihood (affluence). 

Even without livelihood issues/worries, some people (including my family-n-fiend) can feel real pains due to 
* physical pains
* psychological pains .. phobia, anxiety, depression...
* serious lack of self-discipline, or substance abuse, or addiction, in the self or a family member. Remember Biden's son.
* wasted personal potential? If livelihood fine, then the "waste" is tolerable?
* failure in love relationships (incl. non-starter)... "Affluence" doesn't meet this need.
* chronic family conflicts .. eg: me vs in-laws; between grandparents; sis vs grandpa
* injustice .. eg: See https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=24197&action=edit
* gross unfair treatment ... eg? losing a /rewarding/ job for a bitter reason like personality, or unfair dismissal

Bias of hindsight/rmSelf.. I would say a lot of times such an "event" does cause livelihood issues "for a while". Could be a few days to a few years. I guess many (rmSelf) dismiss the livelihood "stress" in hind sight, but in the midst of it the stress our xpSelf does feel non-trivial and permanent (just as covid19 felt like in 2020).

How about the retirement dream? 
* work headaches reduced, but we may miss the engagement, the purpose, the F2F interaction. I would rather stay employed in a light-duty job, and endure some non-trivial stress
* Parenting pains reduced
* family conflict may reduce due to smaller family
* no more personal potential to waste
* I may be more dependent on others

-- trying too hard .. If you aim too high, and try too hard, you will get bruised all over.

I once tried moving up brank, OC-effective. Bruised all over.
quant career .. I made a real attempt for quant career. Too hard. Not worth the effort.
stretch .. In lower middle school I attempted very tough daily stretches. Too painful and unrewarding to continue.
perseverent_foreplay and higher intimacy frequency .. too much difficulty and conflict. I now aim lower... more at peace.
monthly div income .. in early 2010s I was aiming at 1k -> 2k average monthly, using mufu. Such a goal was too high even with U.S. stocks, so I gave up.
grandpa bathing .. grandma was aiming too high, trying too hard to persuade him.
English for wife.. I tried "improving" wife's English grammar and writing. Too difficult. See email in Oct 2023
wordy problems for boy and meimei .. 
EAE for boy .. I am trying too hard since the Jun seminar at NYP.

Starhub port-in issues ... rather than bitterness I could and should feel grateful and lucky to get the answers from the PlazaSing staff.

1 Oct 1am HSBC FAST down time .. instead of disappointment, I should feel lucky to hear the clear answer about 1-7.30am. Also, I was lucky to hear a complete answer from the SCB lady, and lucky to avoid any SCB lock-out.

When you pass immigration upon entry. The current day is taken as Day1. If landing at 23:45, you may want to delay passing to next day
Takeoff or landing timings don't matter.

as my parents age, the free tablespace dwindle. They need to spread out a great deal of stuff over a lot of tablespace, to help them find their stuff.

without low-cost maids as in Sgp, retirees in China and U.S. have lots of real pains.
My parents' home is not kept so clean and tidy. They are too old to take care of it.

Boarding east-bound at Paya Lebar can be crowded. Bugis is slightly better but likely slower. If plenty of time, then CityHall transfer is the most comfortable and convenient.
