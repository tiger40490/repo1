-- new: ##effective endeavors
After the Sep 2023 PEK trip, I realized something not too "obvious".
Many endeavors are ineffective -- either underwhelming, unrewarding or basically fruitless. The more we recognize, respect and remember this human reality, the better we would be able to appreciate those effective endeavors, however small.

TeamSG progressively moved up the global city ranking on many indicators, and not by luck or historical advantage.
Many countries and cities try to copy Singapore's formula and usually fail to get ahead. SG is exceptional in many ways. 
This bpost goes beyond competition or mindshare.

Covid19 .. SG coped better than many cities. I tend to take it for granted, but in 2020 it was by no means a foregone conclusion. SG system's reputation is always at stake, and risk of missteps is always clear and present.
Traffic jams are less severe than many big cities.
Housing affordability for young couples and low-income families is better than most comparable rich cities.
graduate unemployment rate is well-managed
The rise of NUS/NTU ranking is faster than I thought.
SG overtook HK in many ways as world's 3rd or 4th financial center. Not easy at all. Which city can emulate SG?
Many China and India immigrants have decided to take root here ... much more than I expected years ago. These immigrants could have chosen N.America, Europe, Australia or HK.

Similarly, it's no mean achievement of me to avoid falling behind on any front, and to get ahead on a few races. Here are some effective endeavors
~~ half ranked by ...? I prefer fresh, specific items
[s] my git-blog and wpress solutions meet real personal needs .. effectively
[s] my verticle monitor in office was hard to "partition", so I reserached and found FancyZones. Effective.

[s] 2023 JPM5.6k .. my timing was no mean achievement. My workout regime was proven effective in this decisive test.
[s] chin-up, 5/wk .. rare among my cohort. Has have been effective for a few years.
[s] small belly .. not common among my cohort. My lifestyle has been effective in this respect.
[s] The 2018/2019 BMI improvement was unprecedented and unimaginable .. effective for 2 years.
[s] ED pill .. extremely effective for my ED and PmE

[s] exp recon .. highly effective and fairly efficient
[s] deposit-int optimization using EGA etc and RBBT .. effective, as Linna pointed out.

[s] bonus satisfactions in recent years... were by no means a foregone conclusion even after some good years. Luck is one minor factor. I'm effective in managing my own expectations.
[s] i am still able to help friends with CIV in my late 40s, though I'm slower than before. No mean achievement. It is not an automatic result of some external "system". I had to work on it and I will need to continue working on it.
devTill70 plan... Many people dismiss it as a mere plan, but I take my plan seriously. It is a real plan based on real evidence, and an effective road map
trec since Verizon, and UChicago .. effective in personal branding.
[s=specific, not vague]
-- next Beijing trip: meal and workout?

-- well done: Sep PEK trip
diet and workout .. better than Bj15d
lots of fruits and some raw veg
spent more time with grandparents.
Had one healthy and relaxing meal with grandma, followed by a rewarding shopping trip.
big photo .. well done .. research, decision-making, preparation, cost mgmt
bathing .. persuasion, research, efficient execution
USD 20k + 4k .. not so smooth @ icbc, but I did my best and got it done.
Pscb acct .. many trips 
Taught grandma 5-dot log-in, copy/paste/edit in wechat, voice2text

Health declaration form is much quicker with staff help 

14d visa free... references immigration checkpoint wall clock. 

If your exit flight is on day 15 very early morning, you can go through checkpoint 11.59pm on day 14.

When you pass immigration upon entry. The current day is taken as Day1.

Takeoff or landing timings don't matter.

as my parents age, the free tablespace dwindle. They need to spread out a great deal of stuff over a lot of tablespace, to help them find their stuff.

-- update pains of travelling to China
gmail, youtube blocked. Use microsoft Bing
map APPs require Chinese search, but I'm unfamiliar
repair service provider?

-- new: livelihood won't fend off these pains
Even without livelihood /issues/, some people (including Family-n-Fiend) can feel real pains due to 
* injustice .. eg: See https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=24197&action=edit
* gross unfair treatment ... eg?
* .. losing a /rewarding/ career for a bitter reason like personality, or unfair dismissal
* failure in love relationships (incl. non-starter)... "Livelihood" doesn't meet this basic need.
* chronic family conflicts .. eg: me vs in-laws; grandparents; sis vs grandpa
* wasted personal potential? If livelihood fine, then the "waste" is tolerable?

Bias of hindsight .. I would say a lot of times the "event" cause livelihood issues "for a while". Could be a few days to a few years. I guess many dismiss the livelihood "stress" in hind sight, but without hindsight the stress feels non-trivial and permanent (like covid19 appeared in 2020).

19 Sep my reaction to grandma's late night wechat beep
19 Sep I called SGP family 10+ times.

-- fuxi: without low-cost maids, retirees in China and U.S. have lots of real pains.
My parents' home is not kept so clean and tidy. They are too old to take care of it.

-- Toa Payoh to airport
Boarding east-bound at Paya Lebar can be crowded. Bugis is slightly better but likely slower. If plenty of time, then CityHall transfer is the most comfortable and convenient.

Some professions have much higher accident rates but attractive careers to many people -- motor racing, car racing... 

Irrational? 

==== new: ##peaking #
Rarely, a peak is followed by an unexpected peak, but for now I won't focus on this pattern.

Describing peaks is a form of highly subjective self-rating. I want to do it with a positive twist.

Peaks tend to come in waves. Each 3Y window tend to see some peaks. 

Q: what are some (up to 3) recent peaks?
A: joyous intimacy; tech xx absorbency; BMI profile;  

-- diversified investment? 
-- brBufferRatio
-- easy work hours/workload
Covid years are the peak

-- total comp
Probably peaking soon
ditto comp + benefits
annual bonus? Not yet peaking
-- 5/wk workout absorbency? Not yet peaking
-- jogg frequency
-- chin-up

In my 20s and earlier, I used to worry about substance addiction, as if my body can get out of control. 

I think masturbation proved that the biological needs can be overwhelming.

Now I'm nearing 50, I know my body is stable and will not get out of control. Appetite growing out of control remains the last concern.

-- new: final chat with Miles
tech stack is often older in finance than other industries.

Any warning sign before PIP? No java workload for months, but no other explicit performance advice or tip-off.

Did you take up c++ to improve your survival?  Not after Brijesh transferred to London.

I feel Miles might be standing outside and looking through the glass window, as described in https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/47739/2007-adapt-to-us/

-- new: good person: intent^impact
Trigger: Since my 40s, I often explain my "good life" in terms of good karma. I guess karma is about consequences but I feel karma is also about intent.

Both Buddhism and Christianity have tradition of forgiving and accepting ex-criminals, provided they are repentant/remorseful. Clearly, "Impact" is not everything when intention is a factor.

Trigger: Increasingly, I tell my family and beyond (and I believe) that I'm a good person, but by what standard? We judge a person by her impacts on others around her, and her intensions. Kindness is one of the key intensions.

Penal systems in many countries recognize both damage (a form of Impact) and intension. In contrast, most awards focus exclusive on impact.

On judgment day, when you stand before God or Yan2wang2ye2, what things count? Your impacts or your intensions?

Why NYU has so many alumni on WallSt, even though not a top 20 college?
Why U.S. produces most of the top basketball players, out of 4% of world population?
Why such a high concentration of Nobel Econs prizes in UChicago, Harvard and MIT? These universities are the tip of the forefront.
The 5 English speaking countries add up to below 400M population, but why they produce so many global movie stars?

Answer: contexx or opportunity to develop talents.

Sg gov pick upstream domains like financial, life science, digital tech, and bring in multinationals who provide the skill-upgrading contexx to Singaporeans.
