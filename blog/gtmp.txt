-- noblog: buy 
double floss

-- focus on priorities:
solitude campout mode and make progress on Genepai-algo
.. more engagement with Swat team... not my priority, but management's priority
maintain diet, workout. If workout requires time, then let's allocate the time

-- update bpost on bachelor's life
Throughout 2018-19, and a few times during 2020-2022, I frequently mentioned my carefree ezlife to grandpa and various friends. What's special about those periods?

One explanation is the percentage of stressful days in a month.
Living as a bachelor, I have fewer demanding/challenging issues like parenting, renovation, grandparent visits,,, and I have more control over my personal time, diet,,,,

-- reflections on PEK stopover
passport: ICBC and HSBC completed quickly
winter clothing from Beijing .. I did /pick up/ some [socks, glove, thermal pants, jacket,,,]

Some of the jobs well done. I am (not only) "lucky" to achieve them . Few people can achieve them. :
* nursing home visit
* stitches x 2
* naps after lunch and at E36
* flossing x 2 during PEK->NY
* stretch .. multiple times
* cleared most of the reading materials as planned
* delayed movies until I felt too sleepy

-- well done
was able to get up (and sleep) as planned
able to add value to Swat effort .. main j4 this entire trip
workout
diet control .. had some chia. The amount I brought is more than what I would need, so one or two servings are very good.
lipitor .. consistently

-- lucky so far
no jet lag
Swat guys are nice
No need to make progress on Genepai-algo
Boss was helpful in many discussions

-- update which bpost ?
On the flight, "Less forgettable" items can still be forgotten and misplaced
