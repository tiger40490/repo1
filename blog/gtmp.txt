-- update rm^xpSelf
I have blogged extensively about my sense of wellbeing [carefree ezlife; stealth overtake; not left behind on any front; ]

The rmSelf^rmSelf framework is a unique lens, but not exactly front and center to my understanding of wellbeing. Other frameworks are more relevant, such as 4 def@success, livelihood, life chances, Maslow's pyramid
-- update 4def@success
successL is mostly about the evaluative rmSelf. However, if (not when) you are in the flow of successL, your xpSelf would have a great time.

successZ can require a tough effort, self-discipline, and a punishing/painful postponement of (xpSelf's) gratification. 
In the same vein, Buddhist abstinence is a huge sacrifice by the xpSelf.. Not worth it IMO.

successE (compared to the other 3) is relatively attentive to xpSelf.

--update on chronic condition
It's a double-edged sword to compare with the less fortunate and feel less unlucky. Remember the story "Complain less about your shoes. Look at those without shoes." But what if you lose your foot?

-- new: specialist foreign talent.. or update post on EP holders
SG has limited natural resources.. must maximize and compete on human capital, but the local population human capital is also limited.

Fin-IT is one HVA [high value-add] sector. Most of the qualified individuals are foreigners including Indians and Chinese. Citizens like me are perhaps 5% of the talent pool.

The HVA sectors often need talents that are lacking in the local population. Therefore, SG needs to import foreign talents to jump start those growth engines, and hope to get more locals trained in those HVA sectors.

Many of my Fin-IT foreign colleagues really like SG and want to stay here forever. If one of the foreign talens have kids growing up in SG, government hopes these kids mingle with local kids and become naturalized Singaporeans.

These same individuals often migrate to U.S., Australia, Canada, or return to home countries. Therefore, SG is engaged in a global competition for talents and their genes. 

I am one of the well-naturalized foreign talents.
-- new: top xx experts of US/Japan/Germany
Link into "broad strokes" blogpost
Depending on the field, each of us tends to assume U.S. top experts are world-class in that field.

I think only 2 other countries, Japan and Germany, are universally considered leaders in virtually all fields.

Britain could be a #4.

Russia and China are perceived as less integrated into the international community
France? Not perceived as a scientific nation
Most European countries are too small in terms of population.

All other countries' experts are less trusted.

"astra" theme (free) is recommended. 
if you want precise control (me), then prefer non-template, and classic editor.

Link into "plowback" post? Or insert therein

intimacy .. more frequent
workout.. 5/wk
raw veg, smoothie, delay meals
recreational AMB .. recreation is an improvement on lifestyle
recreational piano

Frequently, we hit resistance in these improvement journeys. Sometimes, it calls for zqbx.

pff and gz are not part of lifestyle, and officially out of scope

-- fuxi: drawing board
No choice elsewhere, as far as we know.
The only choice we know:
* Mala board + Mala markers

How I decided to return it on Sat? 夜长梦多. 
Should have called ikea to ask about marker. We didn't have the foresight to know that some special marker exists for this surface.
On Sat, it was an easy and safe option to carry the board back and refund. Greedy algorithm.
