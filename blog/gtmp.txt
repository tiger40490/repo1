-- update 6 color hats
why not frequently used in practice?
Too many colors. I think 2 colors are good. 3 is max
Also, there are too many overlaps and inaccurate simplifications of each hat.

Most ordinary users can only remember one simple meaning for each hat

Black is NOT pessimistic
-- new: Prof Lee Loo Hay
I create this blogpost because 1) we know him 2) wife and I will have many discussions
short but meaningful life
ending on a high note.
his kids are grown-up already.
No health issues. Hard to prevent.
No negative lesson for me to learn.

-- update bubble blogpost
When my bubble ball is rolling on cashflow high ground, it is protected against one type of storm, and one type of blackhole

-- new or fuxi
Q: given the cashflow high ground, how could H.Yi improve their marriage and communication.

Suprisingly, the high ground doesn't provide enough of a buffer of protection against marital risks. The high ground improves risks related to family cashflow, but the high-earning wife is also very independent and doesn't want to play a supporting role to the husband. Not a risk factor in itself, but in some cases, this can indirectly create new risks. Many divorce cases involve two high-income earners.

A: professional couple counselling. This service costs a lot in the U.S.
A: hire a maid to reduce the home-making workload on each parent

Perhaps emmigrate to a lower-income country where systems are less complex and everyday life more convenient.

-- update blogpost on wellbeing (which one?
the concept of wellbeing is very vague and academic. It's a target of research funding in public policy, healthcare, psychology, sociology, economics, organizational behavior.

It's realted to lifetime satisfaction, life chances...

-- new: collective suffering ^ victimized
I need a shorter phrase
How would you feel if you receive no bonus as AVP for many years in a row?

How would you feel if you (alone) experience a pay freeze for 2 years?

How would you feel if you work overseas, and for 2 years you (only you) are restricted (by someone in your organization) from returning to home country and reuniting with loved ones?

How would you feel if your immigration application (and only yours) is refused 3 times without explanation?

How would you feel if your immigration application (and only yours) is delayed by 5 years?

These are extremely unpleasant, almost intolerable mistreatments, but it becomes tolerable when it is a known hardship shared by millions. Fairness is key to harmony.



-- slow-cooking new: 2nd big problem
Imagine you have been struggling against a serious personal disadvantage in a new place, you then notice another personal disadvantage. It would look worse than it is. Your self-esteem (self-image) is already compromised and vulnerable.

eg: when I first came to SG. I struggled with English. Then I notice my age is older than my classmates.
eg: when I first came to U.S. I struggled with "status" and (mostly tech) interview. Then I notice my wife's lack of education and English skills.
