My rmSelf often remembers the covid years (till 2022?) as my best years in terms of wellness, work stress, cashflow high ground, job (not "career") security,,,

But in reality the xpSelf experienced quakes in multiple tectonic plates
* RJO months in mid 2020
* Quark project in late 2022
* boy's constipation
* EDyw struggles since Mar 2023 .. multiple devices 
* Sec3 exam fails + suicidal thoughts + conflicts
* aging parents declines .. nursing homes

When I asked Dr Leow about stress and its effect on my heart, he pointed at himself and his nurse and said everyone has stress. The implified assumption is that most stressor come from work responsibilities. (Obviously parenting, pff, self-care also generate stress.)

Why do I want so much to work till 80s? Let's focus on the work stress.
%%A: my dad...
%%A: my mom loved her job as a lecturer
%%A: I saw many old colleagues working into their 70s or 80s, under moderate stress.
%%A: I am convinced that as I transition into the last chapter of my career, work stress would moderate and decline.

-- fuxi: I placed my phone near the door, but still forgot to take it when leaving home on 18 Mar.
This one failure doesn't invalidate the 'system'

analogy -- Masks reduce Covid exposure but don't eliminate it.
analogy -- security cameras at lightrail stations are not 100% effective, but they do help with security

-- fuxi: On 28 Feb, Frank.Fu lost his job while I received a huge bonus payout, and immiediately computed my YoY asset growth (annual snap),,, I wonder what are the truly important shields that protect my livelihood high ground relative to the wider population

* in-demand profile on finDev market .. my skills are still relevant, but my age is a growing concern.
* burn rate control .. many have pointed out my strength and my advantage in this particular skill
* cpfLife compared to U.S. SSA payout
* HDB value and rental demand  ... not really dependable but better than other rental incomes
* wellness habits, wellness conditions

-- fuxi: older->better verbal communicator
This topic goes beyond the gz blog. I hope this bpost lives on.

why by and large older people tend to become better (verbal) communicators? because of daily practice and continuous learning.
The "practice" is interactive and the learning comes with immediate and continuous feedback.

Exception -- if a retiree becomes isolated he may lose his vocabulary, among other things. My dad is perhaps one case study.

Exception -- some less-used vocab may become rusty. I guess writing a dairy helps you retain vocabulary.

The nei4juan3 situation is dysfunctional, but each individual's action is actually rational.

When the 'system' is dysfunctional, perfectly rational individuals would contribute to the crazy rat race.

I told Yifei about my conscious career decisions in WallSt finDev -- I decided not to join the rat race or compete for higher salary, primarily because I don't have talent for that game. I also lack the drive.

I told Yifei about my career decisions in quant domain -- I found too many bright poeple competing for a shrinking pie (pie being profit pool). I felt it was nei4juan3 and stopped investing my time, but my initial decision to enroll was not nei4juan3, because I had the talent and I saw the potential for higher value-add, or higher utilization of my talent. Now I think this might be similar to the BAT SWE guys. They don't mind 996 or low value-add if the salary is good.

I feel lucky that I didn't need to suffer 996, but some people feel lucky that they can earn the 996 salary.

Yifei's main point -- these professionals have no better choice. The 996 nei3juan3 jobs pay really well, provide a trec, keep your skillset current, make you an eligible bachelor,,,

Yifei pointed out another factor -- I never felt insufficient earning for my livelihood. In contrast, the nei4juan3 guys had a mountain to climb -- buying a home in a Tier 1 city.

some of the weaknesses I overcame with (at least) twice the effort 
Chinese compo
Eng listening and oral
driving practice
swimming
cycling
yoga

-- fuxi: temp jobs: 
I tend to perceive temp jobs positively, as learning.

many unlucky job seekers end up working on temp jobs. No job security, low pay, limited trec
eg: Chinese immigrants to Canada
eg: Shuo in 1997 after graduation
eg: my temp jobs in 2005
eg: many of the jobless 2023 graduates from China universities

If you don't worry about livelihood, then you can enroll in a training program instead.

-- fuxi: no_time ~= no_Absorbency
academic coaching .. requires lots of absorbency, patience
household chores .. requires absorbency and physical effort 
Affliate Marketing Program .. require s absorbency
seeking (and following) counsellor help .. requires absorbency. "Following" is classic zqbx self-improvement.
