-- update dissatisfaction blackholes
Jolt: if I continue to negelect workout, BMI,,, for too long, __zsms__ would likely grow (dissatisfaction blackholes)
even though I put in more hours into my projects
even though I spend more time with kids

Many items are optimization issues [improving from merely "acceptable" to more optimal]

BMI
sleep timing not improving
risk capital increment still too slow? Not a dissatisfaction
too many movies? Not a dissatisfaction. This is much better than that "home movie" situation
not standing enough? Still 1-2H a day though my intuition tells me "insufficient".

-- update rm^xpSelf
I have blogged extensively about my sense of wellbeing [carefree ezlife; stealth overtake; not left behind on any front; ]

The rmSelf^rmSelf framework is a unique lens, but not exactly front and center to my understanding of wellbeing. Other frameworks are more relevant, such as 4 def@success, livelihood, life chances, Maslow's pyramid
-- update 4def@success
successL is mostly about the evaluative rmSelf. However, if (not when) you are in the flow of successL, your xpSelf would have a great time.

successZ can require a tough effort, self-discipline, and a punishing/painful postponement of (xpSelf's) gratification. 
In the same vein, Buddhist abstinence is a huge sacrifice by the xpSelf.. Not worth it IMO.

successE (compared to the other 3) is relatively attentive to xpSelf.

--update on chronic condition
It's a double-edged sword to compare with the less fortunate and feel less unlucky. Remember the story "Complain less about your shoes. Look at those without shoes." But what if you lose your foot? 

(better to use git-blog rather than repeated updates to wp) 

-- new: specialist foreign talent.. or update post on EP holders
SG has limited natural resources.. must maximize and compete on human capital, but the local population human capital is also limited.

Fin-IT is one HVA [high value-add] sector. Most of the qualified individuals are foreigners including Indians and Chinese. Citizens like me are perhaps 5% of the talent pool.

The HVA sectors often need talents that are lacking in the local population. Therefore, SG needs to import foreign talents to jump start those growth engines, and hope to get more locals trained in those HVA sectors.

Many of my Fin-IT foreign colleagues really like SG and want to stay here forever. If one of the foreign talens have kids growing up in SG, government hopes these kids mingle with local kids and become naturalized Singaporeans.

These same individuals often migrate to U.S., Australia, Canada, or return to home countries. Therefore, SG is engaged in a global competition for talents and their genes. 

I am one of the well-naturalized foreign talents.
-- new: discussion on HK with German
Parents face way too much pressure from schools. Even primary schools conduct admission interviews on kids and parents. I tend to dismiss this factor but it is important to some (well-qualified, internationally mobile) individuals. 

Immigrants who originally came from impoverished background probably won't complain. but their 2nd/3rd generations experience decline in livelihood (esp. housing), and complain. I told German that HK is still a wealthy city, but 
the complaint could be more than 无病呻吟.

HK Government is seen as 无能(wu2neng2)/incapable. Used to be an effective middleman negotiating with central gov and with the HK residents, but the current gov is bending towards one side only.

Driven by central gov, the HK gov introduced many changes (filling gaps in legal system). They were implmeneted too fast, not well-thought-out. The authorities don't seem to learn from mistakes.

HK is traditionally a place people came to make money. If the residents lose some freedoms but still experience improving livelihood, then protests would not gain support. I doubt democrasy is that important to HK residents.

LKY said international competition is talent competition. HK is slowly becoming just another Chinese city, and losing non-Chinese talents. At the same time, it is attracting more mainland Chinese talent but I think this is not good enough as a compensating factor. In the long run, it would lose to Shanghai.

I guess the property boom is fueled by mainland hot money, similar to Shanghai?

-- slow-cooking new: 2nd big problem
Imagine you have been struggling against a serious personal disadvantage in a new place, you then notice another personal disadvantage. It would look worse than it is. Your self-esteem (self-image) is already compromised and vulnerable.

eg: when I first came to SG. I struggled with English. Then I notice my age is older than my classmates.
eg: when I first came to U.S. I struggled with "status" and (mostly tech) interview. Then I notice my wife's lack of education and English skills.
