-- new or update bpost on brush-off
reflections on the 92S27 reunion in May 2022

I told grandpa later on "not worth my envy: their cars, expensive homes, maids, top schools for their kids". These are often white elephants. This is part of my emerging wisdom as an older thinking person.

I also told grandpa that my skills are in demand, with market depth in a growing sector. 
I want to actively reduce attachment to the EPA comfort zone.

I tend to brush off my advantages in diet, workout, bonding with kids, brbr, cashflow high ground, continuous learning.
Many of my advantages are in successE and successZ.

I told grandma that it's hard to avoid comparing to the past or to peers. 
Some aging individuals are able to avoid that.
-- update bpost on commute
Need to balance 2 priorities (3 would be max)
logistical efficiency .. printed material (without need4writing) is far more efficient than laptop esp. for short trips or with transfers
productivity zsms .. laptop with coding or tech QQ, or tech books 

When is best time for git-blogg? Looks like an unwanted child. Commute is a good choice, even if not the very best.
When is best time for my growing recreational books? In office and home

Is reading about parenting (and marriage, inter-personal communications) less likely to make a real difference? Yes, blogging about personal reflections are more introspective, more personal.

-- new: visible fitness corners
At GardenByTheBay fitness corner and TPY stadium, I enjoy more absorbency with boring strength training. 

Fort Caning fitness corner is so-so.

In all other fitness corners like downstairs, I feel poor absorbency.

I think key is visibility to the onlookers. 

Some gyms put workout equipments right beside a big window, so gym users are easily visible from the busy street outside. Visibility can serve as a potent motivation.

Q: to match 10min of jogging during quarantine, we could step up/down on a platform, skip rope or squat for a few minutes, but how often can you put up with it? 

Q: to match an hour of jogging, can you do those home workouts for 30 minutes non-stop?

The absorbency required is too high ! Sugar coating is not optional. 

-- new: longRest->tempRecovery
Periodically, we had better bring out each laptop to use for a while. This sentence is vague until I point out 1) oxidation and 2) longRest->recovery.

More than one laptop has shown "longRest->recovery".
I had to power down for many days to get a few hours (or longer) recovery from a defect.

This pattern has many implications.

A slighly defective laptop (eg: A299) can be used in place of a new laptop to prolong the latter's shelf life.

-- fuxi (no good bpost name): 2nd big problem
Imagine you have been struggling against a serious personal disadvantage in a new place, you then notice another personal disadvantage. It would look worse than it actually is. Your self-esteem (self-image) is already compromised and vulnerable before this second blow.

A few powerful examples:

eg: when I first came to SG. I struggled with English. Then I notice my age is older than my classmates.
eg: when I first came to U.S. I struggled with "status" and (mostly tech) interview. Then I notice my wife's lack of education and English skills.
eg: When Satya (MSFT CEO) and wife had their first child with a problem, he took it in his stride. Then his second child also needed a lot of help, as he said in an interview.

Why BMI challenge is so tough in SG vs U.S... could be homeostatic hunger in the SG climate
With the same food intake, in the U.S. I tend to feel less hungry.
