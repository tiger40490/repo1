Most criminals won't rob a random stranger.

Criminals would kill for even a small amount if they feel they are justified.

If you owe them money
If you steal even a single dollar from them
If you cheat them or short-change them
If you show them disrespect, they would feel justified to hurt or even kill

-- update bpost on family counsell 
Advantage of CGC counselling -- counsellor has access to boy's data and has seen him about 3 times.
insurance coverage

consider for-profit counsellor for parenting, diet and other things.

Diet counselling need to be an element due to insurance.
Parenting counselling is a key element as my wife may also need to join me.

I think wife's need is more critical. In contrast, I have a support network already.

-- new: minimize diagnosis psychiatry
Diagnosis has a commercial dimension. It helps with insurance claim.
In some countries, some practitioners are "ready" with a diagnosis.

My focus in this bpost is Singapore.
Some private clinics are more willing to give diagnosis. 
IMH has a policy to minimize diagnosis.

I told Cigna that 1)I need a diagnosis for reimbursment 2) i hate labeling from the diagnosis.

If you do get a label, you need to be careful about the label

Let's tell IMH -- no ODD label please.

-- new: livelihood shield won't fend off these"pains"
Even without livelihood /issues/, some people (including Family-n-Fiend) can feel real pains due to 
* injustice .. eg: See https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=24197&action=edit
* gross unfair treatment ... eg?
* .. losing a /rewarding/ job for a bitter reason like personality, or unfair dismissal
* failure in love relationships (incl. non-starter)... "Livelihood" doesn't meet this need.
* chronic family conflicts .. eg: me vs in-laws; between grandparents; sis vs grandpa
* wasted personal potential? If livelihood fine, then the "waste" is tolerable?
* lack of self-discipline, or substance abuse, or addiction, in a family member

Bias of hindsight .. I would say a lot of times the "event" causes livelihood issues "for a while". Could be a few days to a few years. I guess many dismiss the livelihood "stress" in hind sight, but in the midst of it the stress feels non-trivial and permanent (like covid19 felt like in 2020).

-- trying too hard .. If you aim too high, and try too hard, you will get bruised all over.

I once tried moving up brank, OC-effective. Bruised all over.
quant career .. I made a real attempt for quant career. Too hard. Not worth the effort.
stretch .. In lower middle school I attempted very tough daily stretches. Too painful and unrewarding to continue.
perseverent_foreplay and higher intimacy frequency .. too much difficulty and conflict. I now aim lower... more at peace.
monthly div income .. in early 2010s I was aiming at 1k -> 2k average monthly, using mufu. Such a goal was too high even with U.S. stocks, so I gave up.
grandpa bathing .. grandma was aiming too high, trying too hard to persuade him.
English for wife.. I tried "improving" wife's English grammar and writing. Too difficult. See email in Oct 2023
wordy problems for boy and meimei .. 
EAE for boy .. I am trying too hard since the Jun seminar at NYP.

-- update bpost on hotline annoyances
Starhub port-in issues ... rather than bitterness I could and should feel grateful and lucky to get the answers from the PlazaSing staff.

1 Oct 1am HSBC FAST down time .. instead of disappointment, I should feel lucky to hear the clear answer about 1-7.30am. Also, I was lucky to hear a complete answer from the SCB lady, and lucky to avoid any SCB lock-out.

-- new: China custom tips
Health declaration form is much quicker with staff help than DIY

14d visa free... references checkpoint wall clock. 
If your exit flight is on day 15 very early morning, you can avoid overstay by going through checkpoint 11.59pm on day 14.
When you pass immigration upon entry. The current day is taken as Day1. If landing at 23:45, you may want to delay passing to next day
Takeoff or landing timings don't matter.

as my parents age, the free tablespace dwindle. They need to spread out a great deal of stuff over a lot of tablespace, to help them find their stuff.

without low-cost maids as in Sgp, retirees in China and U.S. have lots of real pains.
My parents' home is not kept so clean and tidy. They are too old to take care of it.

-- fuxi: Toa Payoh to airport
Boarding east-bound at Paya Lebar can be crowded. Bugis is slightly better but likely slower. If plenty of time, then CityHall transfer is the most comfortable and convenient.

-- update...
Some professions have much higher accident rates but attractive careers to many people -- motor racing, car racing, diving, contact sports, boxing, riot police ... 

Irrational?

tech stack is often older in finance than other industries.

Any warning sign before PIP? No java work for months. Beside that, no other explicit performance advice or tip-off.

Did you take up c++ to improve your survival?  Not after Brijesh transferred to London.
