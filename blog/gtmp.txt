My rmSelf often remembers the covid years (till 2022?) as my best years in terms of wellness, work stress, job (not "career") security,,,
But in reality the xpSelf experienced quakes in multiple tectonic plates
* RJO months in mid 2020
* Quark project in late 2022
* boy's constipation

-- fuxi or new: stress: Y work till80
When I asked Dr Leow about stress and its effect on my heart, he pointed at himself and his nurse and said everyone has stress. The implified assumption is that most stressor come from work responsibilities. (Obviously parenting, pff, self-care also generate stress.)

Why do I want so much to work till 80s? Let's focus on the work stress.
%%A: retirement years (60s to 70s) would see other stress, possibly worse than work stress
%%A: my dad didn't enjoy his retirement
%%A: my mom loved her job as a lecturer
%%A: I saw many old colleagues working into their 70s or 80s, under moderate stress.
%%A: I am convinced that as I transition into the last chapter of my career, work stress would moderate and decline.

-- fuxi: On 28 Feb 2024, Frank.Fu lost his job while I received a huge bonus payout, and immiediately computed my YoY asset growth (annual snap),,, I wonder what are the truly important shields that protect my livelihood high ground relative to the wider population

* in-demand profile on finDev market .. my skills are still relevant, but my age is a growing concern.
* burn rate control .. many have pointed out my strength and my advantage in this particular skill
* cpfLife compared to U.S. SSA payout
* HDB value and rental demand  ... not really dependable but better than other rental incomes
* wellness habits, wellness conditions

-- fuxi or new: restanrant side dishes 
In most restaurants and in most side dishes [appetizer, dessert,,,], portion size is below half the portion size of a main dish, but price is usually above 70% of a standard main dish. Clearly lower value for money.

Desserts are even smaller than side dishes. 

I wonder why this high cost. I think restaurant cost is not so much on the raw material. Cost of 2x portion of a side dish is perhaps 3% higher. In contrast, main cost is probably labor cost including taking order, explaining, wash-up.

-- fuxi: temp jobs: 
I tend to perceive temp jobs positively, as learning.

many unlucky job seekers end up working on temp jobs. No job security, low pay, limited trec
eg: Chinese immigrants to Canada
eg: Shuo in 1997 after graduation
eg: my temp jobs in 2005
eg: many of the jobless 2023 graduates from China universities

If you don't worry about livelihood, then you can enroll in a training program instead.

-- fuxi: no_time ~= no_Absorbency
academic coaching .. requires lots of absorbency, patience
household chores .. requires absorbency and physical effort 
Affliate Marketing Program .. require s absorbency
seeking (and following) counsellor help .. requires absorbency. "Following" is classic zqbx self-improvement.
