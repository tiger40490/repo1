-- update bpost on glamourous women
Emily Chang was one of the most attractive women in the world -- young, bright, bold, an Asian female (and gorgeous) face in male-dominated Silicon Valley... a breath of fresh air.

Then her appearance grew old. 
I feel more than 60% of the audience is male, and males are attracted by a young, pretty face.

I guess a mainstream, competitive global media power house that's the flagship of Bloomberg's entire technology franchise can't have a 40-something women as the figurehead.

-- update dean's list bpost
We all have limited laser energy, unable to examine every concept. The NUS dean's list concept is poorly (never critcially) examined and allowed to roam free, and often dominate my self-assessment of JLCJ

The 1stClassHonors concept is also poorly examined, and served to reinforce the same self-assessment.

However, I tend to dismiss or forget my book prize, my UChicago GPA, my 2Y EDB full scholarship, my academic achievements before and after NUS. 

A DeansList recipient may also suffer a JLCJ inferiority. He may point out that he only won twice, out of luck. He may lament about his current income, or his interview performance, 

-- update ... some post on carefree
Since Sep/Oct I feel my carefree ezlife is diminishing/declining/// in some strange way. It takes effort to explain it

Then kids' math exam results ..

In the grand scheme of things, these pains/unhappy episodes would pass fairly soon.
The "carefree" felt so short-lived, but hopefully, it can return soon.

Flexibility? I no longer neglect.
chin-up training? I now pay more attention. Never really "neglected"

Consider a male China-born immigration lawyer , or architect, SWE, (various) designer,,,, whoc came to the U.S. at age 25. He can be competent/effective/proficient in English professionally [in office, with clients, in meetings, over phone]. However, a less-educated local American would be more fluent orally.

SG was behind HK in talent, as HK draws talents from China + the west.
Now SG is becoming more attractive than HK for many nationalities:
* SEAsia
* India
* the West
* Japan?

~~ some long-term disadvantages of sg 
vulnerable to global warming
burning oil to generate electricity
limited fresh water supply .. even though gov is working effectively on reservoirs, river cleaning, catchment
very limited scale in some job domains. For those interested in those domains, they may need to work overseas.
over-dependent on foreign workers and foreign talents
food insecurity
