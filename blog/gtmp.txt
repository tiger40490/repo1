Are there some areas where some peers overtook me quietly?

personal investments in US stocks or property (A.Lin)
brank? Not my game.

I feel none of these examples are worthwhile. Nothing to learn. 

More diversified investment portfolio
more healthy lifestyle.
more healthy sleep timing
more patience with parenting

blackswan doesn't mean "rare event". Most rare events are not blackswans.

Another example: HFT arms race. zero-sum game.

Paramjeet Kaur was charged for her defiance towards mask-wearing regulation during circuit breaker. 

Appearing in court, she only wore mask below her nose. 

If I were the judge, I might mobilize the police force in the court to enforce the regulation. I might interpret it as contempt of court.

Well, the defendant may have a reason for passive disobdience.

How about my treatment of my son's passive disobedience?

-- fuxi: Citrix: switch between 1^2fullScreen modes
When cursor is in either screen, try 3-finger touchpad swipe-up. You can then choose a window to show on-top in that screen. The selected window could belong to the remote or home computer

On an unrelated note, you can also try 3-finger swipe-down.. will immediately minimize all windows and reveal home computerâ€™s desktop. At this juncture a swipe-up would restore everything.
-- fuxi: when I describe my intimacy frustration, I mentioned my daughter's sleep habit and my son's habit to sleep in the living room. In my description, you could tell I'm more forgiving more tolerant of my 2 kids. In contrast, I'm more critical of wife.

I expect a lot more of her.

boy's motivation
brank, OC-effectiveness

Focus on the room4improvement is painful. We need more realistic targets like I had with daily yoga.

In contrast, walk, jog, cycle, basketball ... require speed to be effective workout

Among the U.S. immigrants, probably 90% come from less wealth (mostly developing) countries. Probably below 1% come from wealthier (always small) nations like Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Singapore

part of my current comfortable ezlife is plenty of spare time for blogging. Satisfying, rewarding, but at the cost of tech xx pace.

-- fuxi: somehow I don't mind boy spending 5H/day on computers.
He already spends too much on phones.
phones are more addictive than computers.
phones need data 
phone screen too small

For kids and also adults, when we act aggressively, we need to bear in mind the different aggressive actions.

Worst category is physical (and verbal) aggression, including a small push. In Chinese schools, teachers often ask "who was the first kid to hit the other side?"

Similar to physical aggression, if a kid is angry against someone, the kid can refuse to help that someone. Depending on the context, a helping hand is often considered basic courtesy, so a refusal to help is clearly personal and a passive aggression.

Smashing and angry yelling are not in that category. These are displays of indignation, protest. These can also cross a line in the sand and become aggression, but we usually can see the transition. I feel most of the time, smashing and yelling are not aggressive.  I'm not condoing these actions, but it's important to notice the level of damage -- Smashing something expensive is still less damaging than a push or various forms of verbal aggressions.
