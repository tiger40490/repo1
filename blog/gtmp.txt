AMB looks so daunting but someday I will find the traction/vision
Re my mail to Edmund, most retail investors have not found any vision.
boy's math coaching... My new vision secret is .. put aside benchmarks and try to increase his intrinsic motivation by 1%. Possibly insignificant, but better than nothing.
muscle-up looks so daunting but remember chin-up 100/D was daunting too

-- slow-cooking new: shame and smear campaign
Opening eg: Dick Cheney worried about his gay daughter getting exposed if he were to run for presidency and attract the spot light.

In many jury-based systems, the lawyers would run smear campaign on the key individual + key witnesses, in an effort to discredit them.

Imagine your loved ones becoming the target. Any unusual habits would be used against them.

"astra" theme (free) is recommended.

-- fuxi: drawing board
No choice elsewhere, as far as we know.
The only choice we know:
* Mala board + Mala markers

How I decided to return it on Sat? 夜长梦多. 
Should have called ikea to ask about marker. We didn't have the foresight to know that some special marker exists for this surface.
On Sat, it was an easy and safe option to carry the board back and refund. Greedy algorithm.
