-- update post on college ranking
Within the U.S. the most important ranking is the U.S.News. I think it gives an idea how difficult to get into a given college

Academic reputation of a college is correlated to the size. A large, less exclusive college can produce many award winners and renowned experts. Example:
Berkeley?
Connell?
UCLA?
U London

-- chat with Cigna counsellor 
Most of the resources he sent by email require effort on your own.
All the advice received could be ignored.
Ultimately, the client (me in this case) needs better understanding of the self [priorities, limitations..] and take actions to change his perceptions, his attitude, his explanatory style, his self-talk, his habits, .. 

Therefore, introspective, reflective insight is invaluable. 

I think this counsellor really listened and he repeated his suggestion for the I-statement, including the positive I-statements. These are very direct, rather than vague.

Q: what do you need for self-care?
A: plenty of quiet time and personal space. Wife needs it too. Perhaps I can free her up once a while?
A: blogging on many topics
A: I feel the hunger for more meaningful conversations, with anyone

Q: hypothetically, what would it look like if father-son relationship had improved?
A: more outing trips [shopping, workout,,,]
A: more chats, like the general knowledge chats
A: If I want more physical touch but he doesn't like it, then I want him to explain it in more words. So I can learn and adjust my gestures.

-- fuxi: disabling WindowsEventLog service has an undocumented side effect -- notification area won't show the network icon !

-- fuxi: to disable hundreds of win10 services

These could contribute to performance drags.

Allocated column is more useful than SIZE column as it is after-Compression

-- fuxi: why do I care so much that my long emails are not "well-received"? I told myself that those mails are similar to personal diary. I also told the recipients the same.
Somehow I need to accept it even more wholeheartedly. Remember Wei.Li
