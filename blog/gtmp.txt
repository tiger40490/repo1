-- email to Steve:
The bulk of our weekly meeting is project updates by each developer. By what order we go round the table is a curious question.  I have a basic proposal.

I will assume that those dialing in during office hours can sit through the meeting more easily than those dialing from home after work.

So if the meeting takes place during US/EU office hours but outside Asia hours, then it makes sense to let Asia developers finish  first, so that they can leave the meeting if desired. Note Asia is more than Singapore, so to be fair, Sendhil should not be always the last or always the first among Asia devs.

-- new: growing richer but not happier
"Compared to the post-war era or pre-modernization era, we are substantially richer but no happier."

This is a dominant [widely shared] observation in many countries, at both a societal and a personal level.

In contrast to satisfaction and fulfillment, "happy" is a short-term self-assessment/rating. Re hbA1c vs FPG.

I think most people won't bother to focus or reflect on everyday forgetable happiness, including those doses of delight. We need to focus our mental energy on the problems to solve. Therefore, we tend to remember our adversities [sufferings, difficulties, frustrations, setbacks, declines]. The longer we live, the more difficulties we encounter. Our happiness self-rating would tend to decline. Therefore, improving longevity tend to affect happiness rating.

Basic-healthy nutrition .. our increasing wealth makes BHN easily achievable, but in only x% of the population would BHN bring happiness.

sleep easy .. physical wealth seldom gives the individual better sleep, but granted, wealth can bring you a quiet home and flexible work hours.

isolation due to digital communication.. digital comm is a big part of economic growth, but (like many individuals), it doesn't make me happier.

Involuntary delay to retirement .. often due to poor retirement plann

More years spent taking care of sick parents? Watching their decline somehow makes me feel less happy For Them.. pessimism.

How about grandparents after selling the home? I think they would indeed get a better quality of life in the luxury retirement home. Grandma would become happier .. I choose to be optimistic for both of them.


-- fuxi or new: [24] comparing to the last two quant3sg jobs
In 2023 and 2024, I often feel a spike/surge in work stress, but it is significantly lighter than Qz+Macq.

The proportion of challenging, stressful projects was higher, perhaps due to my "prime" age. 
I was bending over backward more in Qz+Mqcq.
I still work weekends, but now I can make slightly more meaningful progress.
In Qz, I constantly felt incompetent. I had a short window for ramp-up.

Aging is a kind of background heat, or perhaps the growing elephant in the room.
Qz+Macq were supposed to be (later phase of) my "prime years" as a finDev.. high expectations from managers (also self-expectations... crushing weight.
In Qz+Macq, I felt inferior to many individuals in my age group, including ex-colleagues/classmates. 
Now I feel progressively relieved of that /baggage/.

My WStC career plan has strengthened significantly since Macq. WStC is a viable and valualbe option, and exclusive opportunity to me, even though I need to consider grandma's situation and other family members.

My commute and (esp.) flexible hours are now better.
I often take time off without using my annual leave.

A big (often-overlooked) factor is the Qz job smell -- proprietary, dead-end, insufficient documentation... struggle

Paradoxically, salary has never become a big factor in my /stressor profile/. Medical benefits.. ditto. In OC I had my lowest salary but good brbr, as always.
Lower salary in Qz+Macq didn't translate to job security :(

~~ How about stressors outside office? Half-ranked by "note-worthy and specific"
My weekly workout routine has proven sustainable for 2Y(?). On this front, am pulling ahead of my cohort.
My sister has become a pillar of strength.
My marriage has proven stable and _resilient_ 
my kids have proven competent, smart (not left-behind). They are growing up healthy in every way. 
My ptf has grown perhaps by millions (in RMB), despite some small write-offs. I have learned to allocate more to SP500.
My CPF plan for retirement has strengthened. My retirement burn rate has remained stable, despite inflation. 
I have uncovered some hidden but critical health conditions. I have uncovered them early, and become more informed of a few related key risks. Am in a better position to protect my heart and other organs
I have made steady progress and completed UChicago program. No measurable ROI but many intangible benefits.

* conserver lifestyle burn-rate control. For a few years I'm blessed with windfall in salary + pre-inheritance but I know it will end someday.
* healthy lifestyle .. successZ
* GTD tech skills for the last 2-4Y
** JIV competence .. not directly tested over the past 4Y, but I still think it is more important than OTJ competence.

I read more and more respected authors echoing a personal reflection -- a prepared/planned journey to end of one's life is a less painful, less regretful, more fulfilling journey.

One Chinese academic wrote that over the next 10 years of his life (80s), he reminded himself of two serious adversities -- sudden death, and disabilities. (He wrote two essays about 渴望猝死 and wheelchairs.)

I tend to plan for (no fixation) job loss and income drop. Now I also plan for health decline in myself and my parents (not my wife). I think it is a good idea to think about death well before we are forced to. These topics make worthwhile discussions with friends, but might be too negative for the family.

My rmSelf often remembers the covid years (till 2022?) as my best years in terms of wellness, work stress, job (not "career") security,,,
But in reality the xpSelf experienced quakes in multiple tectonic plates
* RJO months in mid 2020
* Quark project in late 2022
* boy's constipation
* EDyw struggles since Mar 2023 .. multiple devices 
* Sec3 exam fails + suicidal thoughts + conflicts
* aging parents declines .. nursing homes

When I asked Dr Leow about stress and its effect on my heart, he pointed at himself and his nurse and said everyone has stress. The implified assumption is that most stressor come from work responsibilities. (Obviously parenting, pff, self-care also generate stress.)

Why do I want so much to work till 80s? Let's focus on the work stress.
%%A: my dad...
%%A: my mom loved her job as a lecturer
%%A: I saw many old colleagues working into their 70s or 80s, under moderate stress.
%%A: I am convinced that as I transition into the last chapter of my career, work stress would moderate and decline.

* in-demand profile on finDev market .. my skills are still relevant, but my age is a growing concern.
* burn rate control .. many have pointed out my strength and my advantage in this particular skill
* cpfLife compared to U.S. SSA payout
* HDB value and rental demand  ... not really dependable but better than other rental incomes
* wellness habits, wellness conditions

-- fuxi: temp jobs: 
I tend to perceive temp jobs positively, as learning.

many unlucky job seekers end up working on temp jobs. No job security, low pay, limited trec
eg: Chinese immigrants to Canada
eg: Shuo in 1997 after graduation
eg: my temp jobs in 2005
eg: many of the jobless 2023 graduates from China universities

If you don't worry about livelihood, then you can enroll in a training program instead.

-- fuxi: no_time ~= no_Absorbency
academic coaching .. requires lots of absorbency, patience
household chores .. requires absorbency and physical effort 
Affliate Marketing Program .. require s absorbency
seeking (and following) counsellor help .. requires absorbency. "Following" is classic zqbx self-improvement.
