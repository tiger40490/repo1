-- new: living]Chn: customer service 
As I told my son, the most essential infrastructure pieces are 
1) mobileNum under_your_name
2) bank cards
2b) bank apps registered with a mobileNum under_your_name
3) Alipay+wcpay, registered with a mobileNum under_your_name and bankCards under_your_name
4) transit app/card under_your_name 
5) bike sharing app under_your_name

When not "if" you hit (big or small) obstacles using these services, you really badly need effective customer service. See [1]

What's effective? Email is usually not fast enough. Chat is slow, and complicated due to Chinese input, and during ID authentication. I usually prefer F2F or hotline. 

In general, China banks, ChM (subway to a lesser extent) offer the best customer service thanks to the physical branches. Among the banks, HSBC is more foreigner friendly but with fewer branches.

Alipay, another infrastructure entity, is better than its peers.

[1] Singpass would be a benchmark in effective customer service. No branches but many places to offer help to the elderly.

wcpay is the worst of all. 95017 is the official hotline.. never tried. 

Bike sharing is the smallest infrastructure piece. Hello has a hotline. Didi has online chat that lets me speak.

-- new: Beijing transit card: more essential than bike sharing
Option 1: the 亿通行 app.. actually easy to set up smrz and Alipay binding
Option 2: keep my precious transit card. Keep a "large" balance to make it valuable :)
I was able to top up using wcpay PPD
I was able to top up using Alipay bank card

I can imagine a (legal?) immigrant to the U.S. (or SGP) without GreenCard. She has lived most if not 95% of her life in the U.S. (perhaps born there) and is more familiar with U.S. then her home country, but she has a relatively priviledged life in her home country (wealth, family network/relationships, status,,,)

Q: which country does she call home?
%%A: her original country, not the country where she spends most of her life ! In the U.S. she remains a second-class citizen (immigration status, skin color, wealth, Language,,,). She belongs to some sub-group, but not upper-middle class.

Aha: it's your social strata within each country, that determine which country you prefer. You can call it exclub, FOLB or peer comparison.

==== update https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/69/counting-your-own-kindness/
“Keep a log of all the kind acts you do in a particular day” — A Positive Psychology trainer  (Edgar K. Tham) mentioned this in the training hand out.

I see myself as a kind person. Kindness is one of the G3 essential traits of a respectable person, a decent person, or a high-quality person. You want kind individuals in your team, in your family.

Each thinking person's yardstick of kindness is slightly different from the mainstream yardstick.

* kind to family .. Perhaps the most important element is .. kindness to family. 
* kind to self .. Missing element in many yardksticks is the Question -- Is the person kind to the self. Does she like herself?
* kind to coworkers .. Are you kind to your coworkers? Look at Larry vs deMunk 
* kind to customers .. For an employee in any people-facing job, I think it's easy to be kind to his customers/users, because he is trained, paid (and monitored) to do so. Negative feedback (complaints etc) on unkind gestures is prompt, recorded, and analyzed with plenty of guidance, so he will receive plenty of "support" to correct his behavior.
* kind to rivals, competitors, frenemies
* kind to friends .. the easiest kindness
* kind to strangers seeking help

恶有恶报 -- one of the most powerful "karma laws of the universe" is about kindness/unkindness.

-- morality .. more strict than kindness
A leader needs moral compass, so kindness is less important.

I'm also a good husband. Many otherwise kind man are unfaithful.

In some positions (such as law enforcement), kindness is probably less important than fairness.

--The western description of Jiang1Qing1 and other political leaders tends to pay attention to the character.

Mao and many other communists have a respectable character.

Regardless of ideology, some personal traits are universally praised:
* courage
* loyalty
* honesty. women of her words / man of his words
* self-respect, dignity
* strong belief in a cause
* independent, critical judgement, rather than blind follower

--update ...
~~ Grade A/B/C
In my initial NUS years I was confident about hitting A's. In hind sight, I was still well above average in my cohort of mostly NS-men

Then in my last years, I hit many C's and even D's. In hind sight, I was losing my position in the more important "second half". I ended up with Upper2ndClass honors.

In UChicago, I had the reverse experience. I started with low expectations -- a pass. Then I emerged well above average and scored mostly A's.

-- update some (which?) post on carefree
Since Sep/Oct I feel my carefree ezlife is diminishing/declining/// in some strange way. It takes effort to explain it

The DIYHI created lots of conflicts, self-blame, zsms about tcost, involution.

Then in Nov, kids' math exam results ..

Then in Mar 2023, EDyw was a blow but didn't /knock me out/ of my carefree zone.

In the grand scheme of things, these pains/unhappy episodes would pass.
The "carefree" felt so short-lived, but it soon returned.

-- new: %%prejudice: China's innovation
I have a growing prejudice that China is an immitator, follower,,, not an innovator like U.S. or Europe. But consider

* 拿来主义 is positive attitude. A country too arrogant to 放下身段 and learn from other cultures will pay a big price over the long run and decline.
* Japan is the first Asian country to open up and reform to adopt western systems ...
* Korea, Taiwan,,,, try very hard to innovate but aren't more successful than China. 
* The west also picked up many things from India, middle east, and East Asian cultures...

Math (and comp science to some extent) .. China didn't invent any, but China students have very strong foundations.

Whenever someone makes a proposition and says it is scientifically proven, we can ask 

Q: Who proved it? 
Q: Are they scientists in this domain? (Credentials?)
Q: Is the result/data peer-reviewed? 
Q: Who are those peers?

I think in social sciences including psychology, peer review is even more important than in natural sciences, where experiments are applicable

Why NYU has so many alumni on WallSt, even though not a top 20 college?
Why U.S. produces most of the top basketball players, out of 4% of world population?
Why such a high concentration of Nobel Econs prizes in UChicago, Harvard and MIT? These universities are the tip of the forefront.
The 5 English speaking countries add up to below 400M population, but why they produce so many global movie stars?

Answer: contexx or opportunity to develop talents.

Sg gov pick upstream domains like financial, life science, digital tech, and bring in multinationals who provide the skill-upgrading contexx to Singaporeans.
