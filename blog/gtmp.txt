-- update 5-laptop
A299 where? cockpit 2 and on the go
Needed on the go? mostly for git-blogging.
The more I bring out the L36, the faster its wear-n-tear.

If a299 is not practical for git-blogging, then useless?
I tend to (over)spend too much time trying to recover some value

Dell250 is reliable in office, just not so usable. I need the L36 in office.

-- new: weekend office trip=worthwhile even if no work done
even if I don't actually work for more than 2 minutes on a weekend trip to office, it is still a good habit, because the trip creates the oppportunity to work.

Parents often buy gears to create the opportunity for their kids to discover a personal interest.

I told many friends that I often go to stadium without a target of how much workout I must complete. Instead, I go there to create the opportunity for myself.

Beside work, 
* I get better diet control in office
* I get superior blogg infrastrictire
* I could work out in office or outside
* I could call beijing more easily

-- fuxi: I have adapted to my living environment
No longer dependent on library
no longer dependent on stadium
Compared to 2018, I have increased yoga self-practice
I can now jog in many simple shoes, or barefoot
I can now use stairs, lunges, skip rope
I now use more of thin bar, yoga block, exercise mat
-- fuxi or update: for the tiny laptop, touch-screen is less valuable
usage is usually short-duration (below 1 hour 90% of the time).

However, when using the tiny laptop in office, the touch-screen convenience might help me avoid sending emails out of MLP

-- fuxi (no good bpost name): 2nd big problem
Imagine you have been struggling against a serious personal disadvantage in a new place, you then notice another personal disadvantage. It would look worse than it actually is. Your self-esteem (self-image) is already compromised and vulnerable before this second blow.

A few powerful examples:

eg: when I first came to SG. I struggled with English. Then I notice my age is older than my classmates.
eg: when I first came to U.S. I struggled with "status" and (mostly tech) interview. Then I notice my wife's lack of education and English skills.
eg: When Satya (MSFT CEO) and wife had their first child with a problem, he took it in his stride. Then his second child also needed a lot of help, as he said in an interview.
