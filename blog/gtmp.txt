--new: Chinese writers on self-mgmt
Since my teenage years, I always believe  Japanese population has talents esp. in thought leadership. (I bought many translated books by English and Japanese writers.)
Japan is a large population with top talents across all fronts.

At around the same time, I also accepted that the Germans have thought leadership, not only Marx and Einstein.

Nowadays, I believe Korean population has talents.

How about India? Apparently, most of the influential individuals are based out of India, usually in UK or north America. 

The biggest elephant in the room is China. I'm referring specifically to the current crop of Chinese intellectuals and thought leaders. However, I seldom find any non-academic but quality book in the domains of my interest.

--new: tcost@piano
3H/week is high tcost. 

if I get to practice 2-3H beyond the 30m lessons, then I would be proud of myself, regardless of the visible progress.

tcost of finding (and now annotating) the score is to be accepted. I used to borrow from library@esplanade. In contrast, tcost of editing has higher accu

tcost@buying and moving piano was non-trivial. Now I can make use of that tcost.

--update the blogpost on HF
t_fomo^livelihood
To HF, do I come across as fully satisfied, without pains, except parenting?

1) PIP, bonus, stigma, respect
2) FOLB, exclub peer comparison
3) boy's "performance"

In terms of livelihood, All my top 3 deep, recurring pains above are "superficial" i.e. not real threats to my family livelihood, largely thanks to my interview skills. But IV is the flagship of a fleet of strengths. I should also give credit to
* the dev (not just tech) job market and my decision to stick to it. I have key talents to thrive in it such as low cultural bias
* the WallSt contract market that I discovered and held on to
* lifelong wellness habits
* bedrock of stable marraige. I made the right choice.
* bedrock of SG citizenship providing essential protections. I made the right choice.
* my lifelong earn/save/invest and Fuller wealth strengths

My descriptions above tends to lean towards external locus of control, but in reality my personal factors are more important.

--update blogpost on piano or python camp
For python camp, yoga and piano, I tend to compare paying vs self-teach

Why don't I compare paying vs procrastination? This is the more likely picture of real-choices. I need to get real and accept the imprefect self.

I think paying may give me the boost I need in self-confidence.

--new jolt: jeju green-tea chocolate
2019 summer my family was one of thousands of turists at a famous chocolate "museum" on jeju island.

The building, the decor was exquisite. Perhaps so was the chocolate but I only had the leftover bit from my daughter's portion.

There were long queues to buy a chocolate ball for about USD 5.

At such horrible $cost + tcost + ccost, you get a real savory experience, right? Well, not in my case. Greentea always ranks as one of my least favorate chocolate flavors, even though this particular rendition was probably a bit more appealing. 

So I didn't join the queue. 

I guess my kids really enjoyed joining the queue for something supposed to be exciting... They don't know what they really enjoy. 

How about buying a high-floor apartment? High $cost and also access tcost but I don't get anything meaningful.
How about buying a quiet suburb home without public transport connectivity?

--no blog
recently I have become quite critical of my son and myself.
* my per finance blogging
* my plowback
* roti
* blogging overspend

Just a few months ago I felt so good about my carefree easy life and my comfortable position among my peers !

Change needed: more burn, more self-pushing 

Need to review the positive efforts "Well done ..."

--no blog: my profession as required when filling up forms

I often prefer one-word answers, but a longer, positive answer could influence my self-image.

--fuxi: when moving to the U.S. i'm likely to lose my current level of carefree/ffree, perhaps due to

* peer comparison

wrong-time and related temptations are tougher for me than saving money.

sdxq-related peer pressure is tougher than saving money on other things. 
I have 36 blogposts on t_sdxq to help myself rationalize and mellow up.

--fuxi: the mattress seller says "you spend a third of your life sleeping" so their expensive mattress is equal in value to 1/3 of your life

Actually, sleep quality depends on many things and the mattress is only 0.1% of them.

The sports shoe seller says your health is more important than wealth, but quality of shoes is really a minor factor compared to motivtion and availability of time

--fuxi jolt: I'm constantly dissatisfied with my 'burn'
* too little spare time spent on work projects, but for decades I have prioritized tech xx over GTD
* BMI not improving, but I am rather successful keeping starch intake low, delaying big meals, smoothie, raw veg, chia etc

but i tend to brush aside my jogging, the high number of hours in office, my improving attitude on boy, revived mtv for coding drill

--fuxi: consider buying a smartphone where I have full control on what apps I can uninstall. 
youtube etc are harmful to my kids, to their habits, to their eyesight...

The benefit of wechat, whatsapp etc need to be weighed against the harmful effects.

--fuxi: I explained to e-power shop boss for a long time ... long-winded
However, this is better than missing some valuable points. These secondary points I make are often important in hind sight.

By repeating myself many times, I usually come up with new content, new pointers. When I run out of fresh content, I would automatically stop.

--fuxi: in old age, grandparents would deal with lack of family support partly because of an earlier chocie -- decades ago they encouraged their children to go overseas.

This is a big sacrifice made by thousands of families in China.

For the last 50 years in China, each family member chooses the city to stay, largely based on livelihood reasons. My wife and I would probably choose the U.S. or SG. My sister chose Australia. Grandparents choose Beijing.

This level of individual freedom comes at a price -- physical separation of family. 

(t_ffreelimitation) If physical contact is important to you, and if you can afford it, you would want to fly (business class) more often, take more leaves, or take lower-paying jobs to live close to grandparents.

identify the cycle of ineffective handling of challenges. 

Sugg: make time and create mental energy reserve by reducing the fixation on boy.
