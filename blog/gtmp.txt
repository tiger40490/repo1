-- update bpost on bachelor's life
I frequently mentioned my carefree ezlife during 2018-19, and 2021-2022. Why those periods?
One explanation is the percentage of stressful days in a month.
Living as a bachelor I have fewer major stressors like parenting, and I have more control over my time, diet,,,,

-- fuxi: some notes about our pre-Christmas meet-up
Hi Xinghe,

After talking to you, I feel lucky about my current job, my wellness, my family, despite various challenges.

Between us, a common "goal" is to work till old age.... I call it career longevity.

I feel lucky about my access to the U.S. job market which will become relevant when I lose my current job and if I can't find an acceptable replacement in Singapore. This "access" is precious and unavailable to 90% of my cohort. 

I feel teaching math/computing can be a viable second career even though I may not be talented. Teaching profession is age-friendly, enjoys stable demand, and provides social interaction (with young people) when I'm old and lonely.

I can also consider teaching older people. Perhaps yoga or aerobic exercise. Some older students feel more comfortable with teachers of their age. Yoga teachers need specific training course.

I enjoy English writing, perhaps more than I enjoy math/computing. I write English diary every day. I can also consider teaching English vocab/writing to Chinese students, though I don't have a qualification. I could consider completing a part time diploma, provided it helps me establish myself as an English teacher.

These teaching jobs are possibly better than cleaner or other unskilled laborer jobs. Nevertheless, I am open to all these jobs.

I feel you have successZ (zi qiang bu xi) and a lot of successE.

I described to you the scenario -- I follow my father's foot steps and go through the same health declines in my late 80s. I predicted that I would want to live 10 more years in "poor health". There is limited evidence but my prediction is based on some observations:
* I can see my father's vital signs are basically normal for his age -- heart, lungs, liver, kidney, cognitive functions. No physical pains as far as I know. Early stage prostate cancer was recently diagnosed and brought under control.
* He suffered poor digestion + insomnia for decades .. not deteriorating badly, but a source of distress 
* He does fall sick easily but nothing life-threatening 

Admittedly, quality of life is uneviable (perhaps miserable). Both my sister and I believe my dad's "pains" are largely pscyhological. His condition was diagnosed as depression. 

In his shoes, I would hopefully fare better. (By that, I don't mean I'm smarter.) I'm hopeful, and optimistic. I don't perceive those "twilight years" as years of suffering.

After listening to congcong situation, my focus shifted to "howLuckyIWasAsStudent" .. lucky and confident

I feel the China gaokao system is a ruthless pyramid with poor upward mobility -- 

* stratification among colleges has probably increased (985/211) due to 扩招. Even though some 2nd/3rd tier college graduates do become "successful" (successC), parents and the society at large ignore them as statistical outliers
* top high schools have a near "supply monopoly" to top colleges

In China middle schools, if you want top collge, then your chance is low if you don't get into a top high school. Average high schools seldom produce such strong candidates for gaokao. I went though high school system myself and I know it. I also confirmed with a few China friends.
In China high schools, if you want a top college, then you must work hard for 3 years.

In Singapore, many average high schools (JC or poly) can produce candidates for NUS/NTU.

Per 1000 high school graduates, I think "elite tertiary edu resources" are more scarce in China than in Singapore.

-- update ... bpost on longevity? which one?
My ffree calc, my devTill70 plan, my 95 longevity target ,,, all have an implicit assumption of /adequate/ health.

Are these plans and forecasts simplistic?

I think some dose of optimism is good. Positive thinking. 
My specific, measurable goals are effective goals. 
Resilience is a foundation of this optimism. 

In my declining years, I need human support more than financial support. I feel Sgp system provides more human support. In another country, even with a million dollars, you can't get sufficient support. 
You will feel lucky/unlucky primarily due to your health and your support network, rather than pff or brank.

Still, career longevity is crucial as it provides social interaction in addition to an income stream.

In the last few (up to 12) months, my subconscious definition of success has shifted from successE to successZ.
Why zqbx? It's becuase of challenges. 
I think my challenges are real, not frivolous complaints of a spoilt kid.
They require zqbx, resilient attitude and continuous effort

My struggles with my son
My aging parents.
My effort on EDyw, workout, 
my strugles in parenting 
my slowly declining productivity, but my memory shows no decline
self-doubt about my fitness for finDev job market
