-- topics to discuss with XA.S
me: In the U.S. I was told that many people get a bachelor's degree in their 30s, when they have figured out what they want to study. I feel that's more natural for many individuals.
XA feels it's not easy in SG. If a guy doesn't attend university, he is likely to marry early. After marriage, as a citizen could get a flat and take on a loan within a few years. (Many would take a car loan, too.) The loan create a financial burden that rules out full-time study in his 30s. XA likened it to enslavement. I think it's something of a trap. 

in recent months (or years), after a decade as a tech guy, XA moved into "people mgmt" (his own words). The team is like post-sales professional consulting, including Oracle DB and Mysql DB. 
Relaxed job? Not at all. XA considers himself not a people-person, but in a people-mgmt role. I said many managers were not people-persons but could hold their jobs for years. XA said Oracle is more demanding (not his words). Too many expectations including revenue targets -- his team need to go on sales meetings.

This "expectation" remindes me of my Macq role expectation and the GS culture. I think Jenny of MS also said something similar about responsibilities and benchmarking.

So my career has plateaued in salary, responsibilities, energy [stress],, In contrast, my peers have (almost) plateaued in salary only. I feel luckier.

me: learning new tech, beyond java/c++ .. I have refused to take up new languages, or javascript etc. Maintenance of c++ critical mass requires dedication and takes up bandwidth.
XA took some Coursera certificates on some AI topics. XA thinks javascript frameworks market value is usually rather low except in the top employers where all tech skills are paid very high. I think XA is sharp. Javascript/Kotlin/golang has poor market depth compared to coreJava.

XA feels some niche tech skills can enjoy robust demand for decades. Examples include cobol and sockets. Young developers won't be interested or won't get the experience.

%%Q: what's your coding interview experience. 
A: only once several years ago. XA has moved out of dev roles. He was a tuning expert for Weblogic, JVM etc, less of a developer

%%Q (minor): what do you say about continuous coding drill
A: yes needed. On-the-job practice is too light too easy.

%%Q: screen time control?
A: be more lenient esp. after the exams. Screen restriction could lead to mental breakdown, but dabao is coping well.

%%Q: how is online affiliate marketing as a recreation esp. when I grow old
A: yes can reduce loneliness. Online shopping is growing.

%%Q (minor): outsourcing in SG tech .. still your concern? web2.0 is bucking the trend
A: fin-IT is different. SG is an outsourcing destination for American fin-IT.
A: Pandemic has reduced the oursourcing concern among Singaporeans.

-- new: return policies in U.S. store
Many store owners have a fine-grained control over return policy.

I remember ctown@Bayonne. I think the owner has a policy that any returned merchandize must be absolutely good enough for resale. If an icecream is opened but apparently untouched, then he needs to judge the customer's integrity. He once put my returned icecream back on the shelf, right in front of me, as a silent but /startk_reminder/ to me "Hey, if you are dishonest then another buyer will eat your leftovers."

In contrast, many shops esp. big shops like Walmart accept returns without hesitation, but some returned items would be discarded. I think these shops have a bigger profit margin to absorb this kinda "marketing cost". The generous return i.e. try-buy is a marketing policy.

-- slow cooking new 相形见绌 @interviews
jolt
When I meet an interviewer (or join a new tech team), I often notice a few individuals with superior technical capabilities. Most of these "superior" geeks are plump, less fit, with less healthy diets.

Many of them, regardless of English skill, are also better communicators than me, but mostly am focused on tech competence -- where I often feel 相形见绌

Similar experience when I was trying out pre-sales and indepedent sales. I encountered many sales dragons. 

Similar experience when I meet an OC-effective peer like Shuo or Lunuo.Qiao. 

Somehow, subconsiouly, I automatically brush aside the wellness differences, playing down my advantages. Well, at the deathbed or when well-off, what is more impotant? Wellness or tech capabilities?

-- fuxi: disabling WindowsEventLog service has an undocumented side effect -- notification area won't show the network icon !

-- fuxi: to disable hundreds of win10 services
msconfig.exe lists hundreds of checkboxes.

These could contribute to performance drags.
-- fuxi: TreeSizeFree
Allocated column is more useful than SIZE column as it is after-Compression

-- fuxi: why do I care so much that my long emails are not "well-received"? I told myself that those mails are similar to personal diary. I also told the recipients the same.
Somehow I need to accept it even more wholeheartedly. Remember Wei.Li
