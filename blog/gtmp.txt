--- (slow-cooking) update .. or new: a few random derailers of my ezlife
academic difficulties with kids
non-academic issues
mess up on an important work prj
me over-reacting and hurting a loved one, esp. ahboy

-- i need many caution/prudent habits to keep my bubble from derailing/breaking. 
keep the house organized.. Slow down helps.
maintain dental hygiene and eyesight .. Slow down? Yes allocate enough time
avoid losing things when on the go
byclcle safety; safe driving
risk mgmt in investing.. Many types of risks.

These habits take years of learning/adjustment, and can be stressful. 

Slow-down is a key safety factor on many (not all) "tracks". 

-- new: trainers targeting greed
Patrick of Gex Academy
Adam Khoo
Ewin Chia
Pauline Teo
Many of the youtube advertizers

This is a sample of the trainers in Singapore.

I feel the biggest weakness in their proposition is endless greed -- exclub/FOMO. That is a poisonous ingredient in their recipe. These trainers seem to /prey/ on this common human weankess. They never preach successE/successL, seldom successZ. 

Many of these trainers are overweight, have imperefect diet/workout habits. Despite their financial status, I don't think they have successE. They are working too hard, enslaved by their greed.

I suspect that many of them have below-average quality of marriage.

-- update post on my english..
Q: How critical was English during the early 2007 adaptation/adjustment[actually a struggle] to living in USA?

Luckily, in early 2007 my English proved adequate, thanks to the formal education in SG and on-the-job training in SG, and my years of self-practice in emails, in-depth discussions with non-Chinese friends.

From early 2007, I had no difficulty reading (any tough material) and .. listening [my traditional weakness]!

I was a fairly fluent speaker in 2007. No one said I had a strong accent like half the subcontinent coworkers, whose /oral/ English was good enough for an offshore worksite.
The Singapore/Malaysia and Hongkong accent was mild in constrast to millions of immigrants speaking English "dialects" from Eastern Europe, middle east, central Asia, S.E.Asia,,,,

In each ethnic group, some 5 to 20% [1] of the immigrants speak decent English, usually due to education, but conceivably due to everyday practice (without education) or untrained talent -- consider my sister and my wife.

[1] Among the Mexican immigrants, that percentage is lower because proportionally many of them came in without a work visa or student visa.

Q: how did my wife cope with English?

I have hitherto left out proficiency in writing. Not an "everyday" proficiency, more of an advanced skill. Challenging for most immigrants. Even native speakers (esp. the less educated) struggle with many non-trivial tasks. 
Writing is a trained skill like painting, public speaking, .... Training takes years. I was generally well-trained over the prior decades since 1991. Now in 2022, I consider myself "well-trained" when benchmarked to the average native SPEAKER.

-- update rm^xpSelf
I have blogged extensively about my sense of wellbeing [carefree ezlife; stealth overtake; not left behind on any front; ]

The rmSelf^rmSelf framework is a unique lens, but not exactly front and center to my understanding of wellbeing. Other frameworks are more relevant, such as 4 def@success, livelihood, life chances, Maslow's pyramid
-- update 4def@success
successL is mostly about the evaluative rmSelf. However, if (not when) you are in the flow of successL, your xpSelf would have a great time.

successZ can require a tough effort, self-discipline, and a punishing/painful postponement of (xpSelf's) gratification. 
In the same vein, Buddhist abstinence is a huge sacrifice by the xpSelf.. Not worth it IMO.

successE (compared to the other 3) is relatively attentive to xpSelf.

--update on chronic condition
It's a double-edged sword to compare with the less fortunate and feel less unlucky. Remember the story "Complain less about your shoes. Look at those without shoes." But what if you lose your foot?

-- new: specialist foreign talent.. or update post on EP holders
SG has limited natural resources.. must maximize and compete on human capital, but the local population human capital is also limited.

Fin-IT is one HVA [high value-add] sector. Most of the qualified individuals are foreigners including Indians and Chinese. Citizens like me are perhaps 5% of the talent pool.

The HVA sectors often need talents that are lacking in the local population. Therefore, SG needs to import foreign talents to jump start those growth engines, and hope to get more locals trained in those HVA sectors.

Many of my Fin-IT foreign colleagues really like SG and want to stay here forever. If one of the foreign talens have kids growing up in SG, government hopes these kids mingle with local kids and become naturalized Singaporeans.

These same individuals often migrate to U.S., Australia, Canada, or return to home countries. Therefore, SG is engaged in a global competition for talents and their genes. 

I am one of the well-naturalized foreign talents.
-- new: top xx experts of US/Japan/Germany
Link into "broad strokes" blogpost
Depending on the field, each of us tends to assume U.S. top experts are world-class in that field.

I think only 2 other countries, Japan and Germany, are universally considered leaders in virtually all fields.

Britain could be a #4.

Russia and China are perceived as less integrated into the international community
France? Not perceived as a scientific nation
Most European countries are too small in terms of population.

All other countries' experts are less trusted.

intimacy .. more frequent
workout.. 5/wk
raw veg, smoothie, delay meals
recreational AMB .. recreation is an improvement on lifestyle
recreational piano

Frequently, we hit resistance in these improvement journeys. Sometimes, it calls for zqbx.

pff and gz are not part of lifestyle, and officially out of scope

-- fuxi: drawing board
No choice elsewhere, as far as we know.
The only choice we know:
* Mala board + Mala markers

How I decided to return it on Sat? 夜长梦多. 
Should have called ikea to ask about marker. We didn't have the foresight to know that some special marker exists for this surface.
On Sat, it was an easy and safe option to carry the board back and refund. Greedy algorithm.
