-- new 相形见绌 @interviews
jolt
When I meet an interviewer (or join a new dev team), I often notice a few individuals have superior technical capabilities. Most of these "superior" geeks are plump, less fit, with less healthy diets.

Many of them are also better communicators, but mostly am focused on tech competence -- where I often feel 相形见绌

Somehow, subconsiouly, I automatically brush aside the wellness differences, playing down my advantage. Well, at the deathbed or when well-off, what is more impotant? Wellness or tech capabilities?

2-printer set-up proved to be surprisingly effective and worthwhile, even though it entails lots of shelf space, wiring, power socket..

-- new: Cigna counsellor #I-statement
I told boy to analyze past mistakes. The analysis is not fun. It takes lots of absorbency. 
Only a small percentage of students can achieve that.
Most students won't "pay" enough System2 attention to this analysis.

Most of the resources the counseller sent by email require effort on your own.
.. including reading, reflection, revisiting questions, rephrasing ... I would say reading is like listening to music and blogging is like creating music, exploring, experimenting. Reading is like eating; whereas blogging is like differentiating various foods and and experimenting with them.

Introspective, reflective insight is invaluable, instrumental. 

Most individuals don't have the analytical power, the motivation, the System2 energy
All the advice received could be ignored.
Ultimately, the client (me in this case) needs better understanding of the self [priorities, limitations..] and take actions to change his perceptions, his attitude, his explanatory style, his self-talk, his habits, .. 

I think this counsellor really listened and he repeated his suggestion for the I-statement, including the positive I-statements. These are very direct, rather than vague.

Q: what do you need for self-care?
A: plenty of quiet time and personal space. Wife needs it too. Perhaps I can free her up once a while?
A: blogging on many topics
A: I feel the hunger for more meaningful conversations, with a real listener

Q: hypothetically, what would it be like if father-son relationship had improved sufficiently?
A: more outing trips [shopping, workout,,,]
A: more chats, like the general knowledge chats
A: If I want more physical touch but he doesn't like it, then I want him to explain it in more words. So I can learn and adjust my gestures.

-- fuxi: why do I care so much that my long emails are not "well-received"? I told myself that those mails are similar to personal diary. I also told the recipients the same.
Somehow I need to accept it even more wholeheartedly. Remember Wei.Li
