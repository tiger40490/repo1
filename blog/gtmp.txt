-- new: 人在 finDev exclub: can fall out any time
I do feel like belonging to an exclub based on gross salary. Above 95% of Singapore residents' salaries (household income is a different historgram). See https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/14177/u-s-income-3segment-sg/

Note I have ignored my NNIA.

Q: where does my $$wealth come from?
A: not inheritance, not rEstate. It's mostly from _finDev_ salary

Q: where does my FullerWealth come from? burn rate control[breakaway]

However, the finDev exclub is elusive, fleeting, impermanent. We can fall out any time.

-- update fake role models..
I remember ML's friend, the 领头羊 guy desribing his persistent headache. 
At that time I was envious of his exclub and successC.
Now I think his xpSelf suffered for years. He lacks successE. Not enviable at all.

-- link to bpost on China students losing their edge...
Chinese culture (and to some extent Eastern Europe, and East Asia) is more serious than the west about fundamental skills (基本功), stringent, tough training

calligraphy
piano
street dance contest... 
gymnastics
women's marathon
speed coding 

In terms of sports, China (and those neighbors) are formidable, but not stronger than the west.

In terms of tech innovation, the west (including Australia) still has a better system including their education philosophy/orientation.

In math, things are more nuanced. I don't know why Chinese mathmaticians are not so strong, but quant world has high Chinese representation.

In many engineering/science subjects, students don't need to be as precise as in quant. A 80% grasp is often good enough to get you an A. 

My sister often says her fellow accountants are often focused on precision and missed the big picture priorities. 

-- new: China's growing number of patents
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/united-states-china-intellectual-property-patents-ownership-economic-policy-innovation-technology-2783356

In 2021, China was the world’s top patent filer for the third year in a row. Chinese firms have filed approximately 75 per cent of global artificial intelligence patents in the past decade.

China’s production of more IP does not automatically translate into a strategic advantage in economic competition with the United States. Rather, it is high-quality IP that has assumed a critical role amid globalisation and the emergence of global value chains, providing exclusive rights to license processes, brands and technologies essential for manufacturing.

Although China’s leadership is well aware of the importance of IP quality over quantity, China’s IP receipts of US$8.6 billion in 2020 do not come close to the United States’ enormous US$113.8 billion.

This is likely due to China’s IP tending more towards adaptive innovation – over half its domestic filings are utility patents. These have lower eligibility requirements (qualifying criteria), protection periods, indicating lower IP quality.

Moreover, in 2020, only 8 per cent of China’s patents were granted abroad compared to 29 per cent of the United States’. Overseas patents are crucial for protecting a country’s IP across global value chains. 

Only 10 per cent of global gold standard "triadic" patents – a set of patents that are registered with EU, Japanese and US patent offices to protect the same invention – were filed by China in 2019, while the United States accounted for 22 per cent.

opening eg: ED medication ads always feature older adults -- older men and their partners. What if you need ED in your 30s? You may get a sinking feeling once a while. It requires serenity, harmony, (passive? yes) acceptance

Desensitizing .. the mass media will always feature older men. You can't blame them, and you can't stop them. What you can do is desensitizing -- to stop your Sys1 reacting to the subtle hint that ED usually affects men in that age group, which is above you. 

No advertizer mean to hint that you are too young to need treatment. Definitely not, but such negative interpretations are natural, commonplace and understanable.

My realYoga sessions also need desensitizing, as I over-react to the irrelevant instructions that apply only to other students.

eg: Dementia publications always feature aged (usually female) adults. What if you need help at an earlier age?
eg: hair dying ads always feature older users, but some of my friends had white hair in their teenage.
eg: Stutter treatment publication always features males. What if a stutter patient is a female?

Livelihood?

-- slowcooking upate resilience
Sg citizens are often reliant on the state. I guess this is similar to other small nations like Finland, Norway,,,, In contrast, Americans, Mainland Chinese... receive less support from the state. "You are on your own." they were told. Such a message is rare given to SG citizens.

The reliance is evident in many diverse domains.

However, Singaporeans as a whole is a fairly resilient nation, as shown in numerous crises [covid, SARS, 1997AFC...]. We are resilient in spite or because of our reliance on each other. 

Same can be said of a family. Kids rely on parents. Siblings lean on each other. 

I guess a small school, a small company are like small nations -- tight-knit group. A larger company can also provide adequate employee support, esp. in the U.S. but company internal such suppport costs a lot to the employer.

There are individuals who don't need to rely on others. They appear to be resilient in the lone wolf sense, but I don't know how common they are, or how strong they actually are. 
I guess in most cases, resilient people tap on a "support network" rather than act as lone wolves. 

One of the most intimate illustrations is counselling, like sexual issues, phobias, obsessions, addictions, behavior issues. Optimism (in the Lone-wolf sense) is just a word, often a weak and ineffective word by itself. Positive thinking is .. ditto. In half the non-trivial cases, the individual needs guidance and help.

Q: What's special about long commute? Why do I suffer so much while others don't?
A: 49 out of 50 of my peers can tolerate it better than I can, just as in an economy seat on a long flight.

-- update ...
Among many Chinese peers like ML.J, Yang was very playful with the controllers. I just felt uncomfortable playing such a role.

When I reconnected with Li Meiqin sometimes in the early 2000s, my friend the businessman Weifeng.Xiao urged me to disclose her number to him. (WF.X had nothing to lose if he could reach out to Li.) I had to pick up the phone and call Li again.. uncomfortable!
Now, WF.X was very comfortable on the phone, but I was more comfortable writing emails. At that age, I lacked the insight, the self-knowledge to see that personality difference. I felt I must muster up courage (to call people) if I were to amount to anything... wrong judgement.

WF.X also used "distrust" as a threat "If you don't give her number to me, then it shows your distrust". It reminded me of my 1994 airticket group-buy incident when I demanded receipt before making my payment. A deeply embarrassing mistake (I could have asked for it in private.)

2022 economist: wealth gap AND income gap both increased, even in high-growth countries.

I feel many workers are struggling agaisnt rising cost in education, transport, food, utilities, and unable to save. 

I guess that their rising income is not enough to compensate for the rising costs, esp. in discretionary categories like longer and more expensive education, private transport, entertainment, dental/skin care, improved nutrition. These costs didn't exist in their earlier baskets.

UChicago is the #1 university outside the east and west coasts. Here are a few more.
Northwestern

The busienss schools, law schools and medical schools have separate national rankings. UChicago has top-ranked business school and law school, both comparable to Harvard.

CalTech has a ranking advantage that in its strongest domains, there are many nobel prizes, more than in compSci, humanities.

-- slowcooking update bpost on brush-off
reflections on the 92S27 reunion in May 2022

I told grandpa later on "not worth my envy: their cars, expensive homes, maids, top schools for their kids". These are often white elephants.
This is part of my emerging wisdom as an greying and thinking adult.

I also told grandpa that my skills are in demand, with market depth in a growing sector. 
I want to actively reduce attachment to the EPA comfort zone.

I tend to brush off my advantages in diet, workout, bonding with kids, brbr, cashflow high ground, lifelong learning.
Many of my advantages over these ex-classmates are in successE and successZ.

In whatever that matter to me, I don't feel left behind. I am getting ahead, in stealthy footsteps.

-- fuxi or update bpost on commute (which one?)
Need to balance 2 priorities (3 would be max)
logistical efficiency .. printed material (without need4writing) is far more efficient than git-blogg esp. for short trips or with transfers
productivity zsms .. laptop with coding or tech QQ, or tech books 

When is best time for git-blogg? Looks like an unwanted child. Commute is a good choice, even if not the very best.
When is best time for my growing recreational books? In office and home
