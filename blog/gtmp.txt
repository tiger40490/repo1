This happens regardless of his financial status

This is a jolt to me, because I feel the rich parents deserve no help.

--new: human nature: satisfied for good@@
The Bhuddist observes that human desires are satisfied only temporarily.

I don't desire eternal youth. I do want healthy longevity. Limitless desire? Yes if scentifically achievable.

I don't have endless lust or craving for novelty in sex life.

Financially, since 2018 I have felt satisfied with my current cashflow high ground. I do long for even more assurance of family livelihood, in terms of career longevity, inflation protection, healthcare assurance ... 

I am more and more aware that "financial livelihood" (including healthcare resources) is easier to control than personal health. So my current level of livelihood protections are adequate and I don't long for ever higher assurance.

So what imaginary role model do I envy most? Not a big manager with his work/life balance and stress level. I guess cash flow higher ground is enviable, but I'm not that bad.

Basically, the only unlimited desire in me is healthy longevity.

dating agency, dating website can work better than "existing network". I actually told a newpaper reporter that tcost is the dominant factor. With dating agency, in a month you can reveiw many profile and meet more than 5 candidates. 

Mind you, We are talking about life partners. 

Klook experience using LinkedIn is similar. https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/klook-entrepreneur-says-linkedin-helped-him-find-start-up-co-founder.html

I have long questioned the conventional wisdom of relying solely on existing network

In my high school, there were a few focused self-practices that failed to create a visible lead over my peers
* fwd bend
* basketball? I improved my drible and shooting significantly but not enough for a competitive game.

How did I react?

How can my son learn from it?

I would say I have reaped dividend for years.. I was able to enjoy basketball much more, and take part in many non-competitive games. My fwd bend is a good part of my rather tight mid-section.

when you see a boxer using only one hand, probably he has a weakness in the other hand, or he is keeping his stronger arm as reserve.

There are many examples of each.

Use bat file, or bash or perl (strawberry)
check in the script
maintain individual scripts for each machine. 

tbudget 5-10H. Patience needed. Most people seem to be the uncommitted hare rather than the slow but committed tortoise. MengZi compared crabs vs earthworms

a lot of effort is on dealing with windows permissions.
