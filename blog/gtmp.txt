Using Nobel prizes as a university ranking criteria has multiple problems.

Problem: peace prize is not as relevant as, say, a Chemistry prize, but it's unfair to leave it out completely.
Problem: many academic domains have no Nobel prize, while physics/chemistry/bioscience enjoy the limelight. 
Problem: what if a Nobel laureate is actively courted to work in various universities to boost their ranking? Should the methodology exclude any tenure of a laureate after the award?
Problem: should exclude short-term stays as students or staff .. how short?

I don't know why many (usually white) Americans enjoy horse training and riding.
I feel it's very dangerous. Whenever you fall, there's a real probability of injury.

How does it compare to motorbike or car driving? 

I sometimes envy their enjoyment, but that enjoyment is not so important to me. 

How about keeping a dog? I think there's a real advantage -- my kids would be more confident about dogs. Dogs are quite common in the U.S.

How is yoga in comparison? Is yoga that important? I guess it motivates me to keep working on flexibility. In that way it is life-enhancing.

2022 economist: wealth gap AND income gap both increased, even in high-growth countries.

I feel many workers are struggling agaisnt rising cost in education, transport, food, utilities, and unable to save. 

I guess that their rising income is not enough to compensate for the rising costs, esp. in discretionary categories like longer and higher education, private transport, entertainment, improved nutrition, dental/skin care. These costs didn't exist in their earlier burn rate.

UChicago is the #1 university outside the east and west coasts. Here are a few more.
Northwestern
Vanderbilt
Rice

The busienss schools, law schools and medical schools have separate national rankings. UChicago has top-ranked business school and law school, both comparable to Harvard.

CalTech has a ranking advantage that in its strongest domains, there are many nobel prizes, more than in compSci, humanities.

-- update bpost on college ranking
Reputation ranking based on surveys tend to suffer from alumni bias. A large university (high population) would have a larger number of past employees, parents, and alumni. When they are included in the surveys, they tend to give it inflated scores.

QS is more about reputation, but they miss the key point that "Within a big country reputation is usually national, seldom international. "

For an international student choosing a college to apply, QS meets the requirement, comparing the reputations at a global level.

For a domestic student looking across her own country (India, China, or U.S.), the local ranking by national agencies are overriding. The national ranking may put BB well above AA (whereas international rankings put AA above BB), and the domestic student would usually ignore international ranking.

In fact, international students mostly choose high quality universities, so the percentage of international students is a valid yardstick of quality.

Shanghai ranking is more stable than QS or THE.

reflections on the 92S27 reunion in May 2022

I told grandpa later on "not worthy of my envy: their cars, expensive homes, maids, top schools for offspring". These are often white elephants. 
This is part of my emerging wisdom as an older intellectual.

I also told grandpa that my skills are in demand, with market depth in a growing sector. 
I want to actively reduce attachment to the EPA comfort zone.

I tend to brush off my advantages in diet, workout, bonding with kids, brbr, cashflow high ground, continuous learning.
Many of my advantages over these ex-classmates are in successE and successZ.

In whatever that matter to me, I don't feel left behind. I am getting ahead.

I now feel slightly less guilty about my growing dependency on AC.

(Is there anything NOK to switch on/off frequently? No evidence.)

Dependency on AC is very common, so commercial support is widespread.
Dependency on car is ditto, but the commercial support is pricier.

Dependency on wireless connectivity is very common, but you depend on other people most of the time.
Dependency on wpress is uncommon
Dependency on NY/NJ subway is common during peak hours only. Extra dependency on it is uncommon.

-- update bpost on commute (which one?)
Need to balance 2 priorities (3 would be max)
logistical efficiency .. printed material (without need4writing) is far more efficient than git-blogg esp. for short trips or with transfers
productivity zsms .. laptop with coding or tech QQ, or tech books 

When is best time for git-blogg? Looks like an unwanted child. Commute is a good choice, even if not the very best.
When is best time for my growing recreational books? In office and home
