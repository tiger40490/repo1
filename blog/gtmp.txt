--update blogpost on self-care
what self-care t-spends (don't)work
workout -- is probably the most efficient self-care. Sometimes it lifts my mood, but this time mostly invisible self-care. I need to maintain and hopefully increase the workout.

movies with kids -- generate self-hate, though it sometimes builds some bonding

time with grandpa -- yes self-care

longer sleep than before -- need to try. Can generate guilt. Can help immunity

tech learning -- might provide some self-care

therapeutic blogging -- is kinda "meditation" for me.

--sugg: Again, consider setting up a temporary work station in bedroom. Aim at 30m of quality time each day.
I can avoid seeing my son's misbehavior. Out of sight, out of mind.

ask wife for suggestion

--reasons why the long PCN bike trip was challenging
1) scotching sunlight
*) MRT, buses were considered coronaviris-risky
*) parts of the terrain were unfamiliar and tough
*) no placce to sit down for refreshment
*) boy was wearing dark, without sunblock
*) constantly worried about bringing coronavirus to home

apologize to meimei for my retaliations. It was too cruel of daddy. Daughter apologized to daddy; daddy can also apologize to daughter.

try some light exercise or jog on the street during the noisy hours, since I can't get much work done anyway. In my experience, an hour of exercise always improves my mood.

try to create some quiet hours in early morning, and make the best use of it

Many experienced wfh practitioners suggest a fixed daily routine, not working on and off throughout the day and not getting much done. I need to break up my time into half-hour chunks
Q: why I spend so many hours at work but not get enough done?
A: I may realize that I actually do finish quite a lot of work in some of those chunks.

--new: mainstream solution is often grossly inferior
earliest example: English vocabulary building as baptism by fire? My Singapore teachers/classmates suggested reading newspapers but actually dictionary-browsing proved far more efficient and effective

early eg: personal note keeping? When I bought my first computer in 1998, mostly to keep personal notes, I found the mainstream solution of MSWord was far inferior to ascii files

personal eg: to protect my c:\0 from my son's windows account, the mainstream solution of windows folder security was overcomplicated. See ...
eg: U.S. medical insurance is overcomplicated compared to national healthcare systems in other countries. 
eg: U.S. medical billing/coding is overcomplicated. In contrast the Singapore system is much simpler.
eg: GUI programming? html + browser (before javascript) proved so much simpler than client-server

eg: my very first paid programming job was rather mainstream -- Excel + ftp, but the nascent CGI proved far better documented, more reliable...

eg: file system security?  Microsoft solution is overcomplicated compared to unix. I thought the Microsoft solution was mainstream
eg: config files? Unix tradition uses individual text files per application, much simpler than windows registry. I thought the registry design was mainstream (see my blogpost on registry)

--new: 
unexpected success with home wifi set-up
* tip: cable point need at least 2 power sockets to support 4 to 6 devices -- modem, router, powerline networking, phone
* tip: place the devices high up, to free up table space. Most devices (except phone) should be shileded from access
** to achieve this, I chose wall-mounting rack
* minor tip: place wifi router in the open living room. Best practice is ceiling-mount. If not possible, consider powerline networking.
* tip: install power sockets higher up throughout the house

--due to PSLE, compulsory WFH
now is the time that I need 
* reap the plowback;  spend political capital
* use rainy day reserve
* ctbz (寸土必争) in such spending

--new: how to improve mood of gp, wife
