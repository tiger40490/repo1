--in mid March 2020, I visited swimming pool and couldn't help comparing with my last bachelor phase around age 31, when I developed weekly swimming routine.
At that time I didn't know any way to earn more than 5k
I didn't know my killer talent at theoretical QQ topics like low-level, math, concurrency principles
I didn't have a dev-till-40 plan (let alone 70) or the associated security in family livelihood.
i didn't have the nonwork income sources
I didn't have UChicago brand

--new:
Some friends got a quant degree from CMU, NYU etc, but branding is lower than UChicago
