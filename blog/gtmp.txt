-- chat with Alina
The CTO is a workholic, working 10am - 1am. I see wrong priorities in that, esp. viewed at the deathbed. The company, the profit, is not an achievement considered worthwhile in the end.

I told Alina my priorities have shifted to wellness [longevity, 5/wk] as I don't need more money so badly. I think this is similar to MMM attitude.

How much is "enough money"? Remember the latency discussion, and other blogposts

Alina shared her experience about renting, and said she really wanted home ownership. I find this sentiment very strong. Those young professionals in Beijing seem to be trapped. Residential properties are pushed high by hot money. Many people probably want to avoid this "game" but they also feel renting is not sustainable not satisfactory. 

I feel U.S. culture is different. Many smart Americans (including some middle-class) stay renting long-term by choice.

I have moved on. Semi-retired. kinda mellowing up. fat-n-happy.

Compared to them, I now allocate more t$ to wellness, career longevity, recreations..

-- new: places that enhances absorbency 
To enhance absorbency for study, workout etc, I need
* library, MRT or bus interchange .. I have tried this many times
* open green field at dusk like 6 - 7.30. In TPY I can't find such a field. I think the jogging track by Kallang river might work. 

TPY stadium is decent but not exactly that.

-- new: Opera install
I generally prefer portable versions as they are easier in restricted environments. 
The regular download can create a a portable installation. It has comparable features as regular Opera, but it can't use the preserved bookmarks :(
To use preserved bookmarks, we need the regular install, but please don't install it into C:\programPortable, please!

I prefer the specific download with a version number and x64/x86. The default download is ambiguous can could install into a misleading location.

If free space is insufficient, the aborted installation can leave behind a litter of 200MB. If you don't clean it up manually, then in the future you won't know it is litter.

-- new: to disable hundreds of win10 services
msconfig.exe lists hundreds of checkboxes.

These could contribute to performance drags.

-- fuxi: why do I care so much that my long emails are not "well-received"? I told myself that those mails are similar to personal diary. I also told the recipients the same.
Somehow I need to accept it even more wholeheartedly. Remember Wei.Li
