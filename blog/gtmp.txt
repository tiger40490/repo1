I need a phone app to append to existing audio clips 

The app in vivo phone can only append to a paused recording, before saving it.
--update sunshine
In which area do you give much-needed sunshine but your peers don't bother to?

The question asks me to name where I give sunshine, so it's impossible to surprise myself, but I will still try to name unsung heros.

adequate sleep
driving experience review
tech Dram refresh
flexibility
exp recon
career longevity + healthy longevity
current income? Not really "much-needed"

-- A95 have many "saving graces"
* speaker with easy volumne control
* figerprint reader

guilt is counterproductive in many of these cases...

In each case, I often have a j4 or excuse..

[a=absorbency is a scarce resource]
[a] workout fewer than 5 times a week
[ap] no yoga for months .. but am able to do more self-practice
[ap] weight slowly edging up from 61 to 66 .. but am able to maintain starch intake, raw veg..
[a] not standing enough .. but I still do some in office and at home
cockpit 1 not used a lot
[p] not spending enough time with kids
[ap] pull-up not maintained, largely due to lack of absorbency
[ap] c++ critical mass? 
[a] localSys fuxi
not sleeping early as planned... but kinda low priority
[a] piano not continued .. largely due to high tcost

-- fuxi: (too vague to get a title) life chances in each country.
Now I feel those in Taiwan get fewer life chances due to the stagnant economy. After finishing education, many go to mainland for more life chances. In Taiwan, even if you are reasonably smart and hardworking, the chance of earning a U.S. level salary is quite small. Actually, I used an arbitrary criteria.

Since 2019, the Hongkong residents are also experiencing a decline in life chances.

For many years, I have felt varioius SEAsia nationals have better life chances when thy emmigrate to SG, HK, White English-speaking countries.

When Jess Lin echoed and rephrased me "your forte in shoulder flexibility", she kinda exaggerated a bit, but there's no real misrepresentation. As yoga instructor, she knew jolly well my shoulder !

Still, I felt a slight discomfort and corrected her "not so good at shoulder".

My habit works fine in online chat, but it is too inefficient in SMS and unnecessary in verbal conversations like this.

-- new: simplify your life
t_vague
The choices, and temptations in modern life increases distraction and risk of missteps. Therefore, steadfast focus on protecting... really benefits from simplification.

Prioritization also benefits from simplification

thick->thin is one feature of simplification esp. in theoretical learning.

.. diet .. simply focus on delaying and portion-reduction. Use a few tried-n-tested techniques like raw veg
.. exercise .. simply focus on 5 times a week. fancy equipment not needed. Variety can be good, but I don't want to depend on it.
.. top schools? simply say no.
.. career planning .. focus on dev-till-70. Not so simple but I have managed to simplify a bit.
.. eq investing .. simply focus on current income
.. smartphone addiction .. base camp is a simple concept.

--fuxi: i feel not doing well on a few fronts
work proj, localSys esp. fuxi
QQ refresh, coding drill
parenting 
wellness

Here's a related, secondary question: 
Q: Which areas need the most sunshine in terms of time and laser energy?

iPhone policy with boy. Better to reach agreement
wellness and essential self-care
localSys fuxi and self-learning
work proj? not for the next 2 weeks !

人就是这样，装得久了，就装得像了；装得太像、太久，不管事实怎样，自己倒是先信了。而这当然会影响之后的决定和行为。
examples in n around me:

My kindness
My dedication to work and professionalistm
my quality mindset

when you see a boxer using only one hand, probably he has a weakness in the other hand, or he is keeping his stronger arm as reserve or as secret weapen

There are many examples of each.
