How would you feel if you work overseas, and for 2 years you (only you) are restricted (by someone in your organization) from returning to home country and reuniting with loved ones?

How would you feel if your immigration application (and only yours) is refused 3 times without explanation?

eg: when I first came to SG. I struggled with English. Then I notice my age is older than my classmates.
eg: when I first came to U.S. I struggled with "status" and (mostly tech) interview. Then I notice my wife's lack of education and English skills.
