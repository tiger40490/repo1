--fuxi: the mattress seller says "you spend a third of your life sleeping" so their expensive mattress is equal in value to 1/3 of your life

* too little spare time spent on work projects, but for decades I have prioritized tech xx over GTD
* BMI not improving, but I am rather successful keeping starch intake low, delaying big meals, smoothie, raw veg, chia etc

but i tend to brush aside my jogging, the high number of hours in office, my improving attitude on boy, revived mtv for coding drill

--fuxi: in old age, grandparents would deal with lack of family support partly because of an earlier chocie -- decades ago they encouraged their children to go overseas.

This is a big sacrifice made by thousands of families in China.

For the last 50 years in China, each family member chooses the city to stay, largely based on livelihood reasons. My wife and I would probably choose the U.S. or SG. My sister chose Australia. Grandparents choose Beijing.
