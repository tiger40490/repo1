road without traffic light is safer than red pedestrian light, because motor vehicles are more watchful.

-- new: hear both sides@story, or get brainwashed
Our judgement of morality, character... etc is subject to brainwash.
* eg: my son's opinion of CCP
* eg: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Catch_a_Predator
* eg: https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=6980&action=edit

We need to read the criticisms, counter arguments, both sides of the story.

Why NYU has so many alumni on WallSt, even though not a top 20 college?
Why HK has so many "top financial professionals" out of a tiny population?
Why U.S. produces most of the top basketball players, out of 4% of world population?

Answer: contexx or opportunity to develop talents.

Sg gov pick upstream domains like financial, life science, digital tech, and bring in multinationals who provide the skill-upgrading contexx to Singaporeans.

--new reputation of Singapore public/private colleges.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_universities_in_Singapore lists 6 "official" universities + dozens of private degree programs. The latter are joint ventures with foreign universities, such that the degree is conferred by the foreign university.

The salesperson of the private program would stress that the degree certificate is equivalent to certificates earned from main campus (overseas), and it shows no difference whatsoever. 

What's the #1 yardstick to guage these universities? I would say reputation. Reputation is measured in many ways. Many of them are related to quality, but it's quite possible that UniA has better quality than UniB but lower reputation. 

The new universities and private universities struggle to establish credibility/reputation, which they need in order to attract 1) students 2) employers/sponsors. 

Long history and large student intake help name recognition. Even non-positive associations can help build name recognition. A college with such a name recognition must be reasonably good to survive 100 years.

NTU engineering may be better quality in edu, and more research output than NUS engineering, but in terms of reputation, recognition, a longer history does matter.

Same for STDU engineering. When I meet a SUTD grad vs NTU grad from the same major, how do I perceive their talent/capabilities?

HK, UK and other gov have special immigration schemes for "top 100 unversity grads". The officials in charge would reference published rankings but still control their own G100.
If your college wants to be included, then you need to be well-connected to the global network of academia.

% International students is a key factor. I think international faculty is another key factor. short-term exchange scholars too.

English (feasibility of coping without local language) is factor affecting foreign students/staff.

I don't want to waste my (reusable) frames even though Cigna pays everything. It's a waste of resources, and also indirectly raises premium.

-- update bpost on glamourous women
Emily Chang was one of the most attractive women in the world -- young, bright, bold, an Asian female (and gorgeous) face in male-dominated Silicon Valley... a breath of fresh air.

Then her youthful face grew old. 
I feel more than 60% of the audience is male, and males are attracted by a youthful, pretty face.

I guess a mainstream, competitive global media power house that's the flagship of Bloomberg's entire technology franchise can't have a 40-something women as the figurehead.

-- fuxi ... or update some post on carefree
Since Sep/Oct I feel my carefree ezlife is diminishing/declining/// in some strange way. It takes effort to explain it

The DIYHI created lots of conflicts, self-blame, zsms about tcost, involution.

Then kids' math exam results ..

In the grand scheme of things, these pains/unhappy episodes would pass.
The "carefree" felt so short-lived, but hopefully, it soon returned.
