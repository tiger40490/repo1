Majority of the people in my "home" cities waste numerous small amounts of money on a monthly basis. Over decades they "throw down the drain" a painful portion (like 10-20%) of their income.

Large number of small time-wastage is similar. Some of us feel the pain only years later when our peers make progress in their spare time or their office hours.

calorie-quota overconsumption is similar. We look back and feel the pain, sooner or later.

Among these ...., usable time is the most scarce, available up to age 60 or 55 for some.

Among these talents, the most significant (was $) is calorie-quota budgeting. It has long-term health benefits.

Among these endeavors, my success is most visible and decisive in $$, and least in time-saving

calorie-quota is a similar concept to carbon-quota. Each country each year is given a quota. If you over use then you need to borrow from the future quota.

Most adults or young people don't monitor their burn rate, calorie-quota or regular exercise. The cumulative effect would eventually show up.

I have a visible personal strength.

This is one reason for my carefree life now. Any freedom comes with responsibility.
