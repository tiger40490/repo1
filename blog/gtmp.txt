-- chat with Alina
The CTO is a workholic, working 10am - 2am. I pointed out wrong priority, esp. at deathbed. The company, the profit, is not an achievement considered worthwhile

I told Alina my priorities have shifted to wellness [longevity, 5/wk] as I don't need more money
== new ## tips on tag/cat naming
If a word ends in gg/tt etc and then -ing, we should drop the "-ing". For example, blogg, tagg
-- category naming only
Categories are hierarchical. Some info can be inferred from the parent category and can be omitted.

Category sorting matters, esp. in the listing page, when I pick a category from the dropdown to display.

To "control" sorting, hot categories have two alternative names. For example, an1kang1/wellness would sort to top, while wellness/an1kang1 would sort to bottom.

If a category need to sort to top but lacks a good alternative name, then prefix 0, temporarily.
If a category must sort to bottom but lacks a good alternative name, then prefix x_, permanently.

-- new: dependency^efficiency
Now I think most of my efficiencies, my peers' efficiencies, organizational and government efficiencies are built on ("dependency") some technologies. Dependency and efficiency might be the two sides of a coin.

Opening eg: ..

eg: The jogger backpack ehnances convenience at a small total cost. The purist can say it is an unnecessary convenience, but I disagree

eg: 2-printer home set-up... does enhance my efficiency

eg: printout for paper-blogging .. does enhance my efficiency. (In this example, I want to focus on printout for _blogging_.) Consider the cost and reliability of basic printers, I feel this dependency is lower than the online-blogger's dependency or the offline blogger's dependency.

G9 best eg: tuition

G9 best eg: yoga studio.
eg: see the blogpost on $7.50 salad

G9 best eg: printout for work/learning .. (in general). It does enhance my efficiency, proven over 20Y. In some cases the dependency is unwanted.

eg: 5-laptop set-up .. (all active). It sounds like overdependency, but I would argue that the incremental benefit/cost is favorable at each acquisition.

eg: dependency on office/McDonald/MRT as harbor .. enhances my self-care, well-being..

eg: King's speech .. his dependency on his speech therapist

eg: SG and many governments rely on e-gov technologies .. efficient

eg: many economies have a serious dependendency on fossil fuel.

I have moved on. Semi-retired. kinda mellowing up. fat-n-happy.

Compared to them, I now allocate more t$ to wellness, career longevity, recreations..

-- new: places that enhances absorbency 
To enhance absorbency for study, workout etc, I need
* library, MRT or bus interchange .. I have tried this many times
* open green field at dusk like 6 - 7.30. In TPY I can't find such a field. I think the jogging track by Kallang river might work. 

TPY stadium is decent but not exactly that.

--fuxi or new: excessive blogg@@
part of my current comfortable ezlife is plenty of spare time for blogging. Satisfying, rewarding, but at the cost of tech xx pace.

A related consequence -- as I reduce online blogging, I get a growing backlog in git-blog.
