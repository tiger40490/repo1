If a picture is too large when added to gmail, it would mess up gmail display.

-- chat with Alina
The CTO is a workholic, working 10am - 1am. I see wrong priorities in that, esp. viewed at the deathbed. The company, the profit, is not an achievement considered worthwhile in the END.

I told Alina my priorities have shifted to wellness [longevity, 5/wk] as I need more money only half-heartedly. I think this is similar to MMM attitude.

How much is "enough money"? Remember the latency discussion, and other blogposts.

Alina shared her experience about renting, and said she really wanted home ownership. I find this sentiment very strong. Those young professionals in Beijing seem to be trapped. Residential properties are pushed high by hot money. Many people probably want to avoid this "game" but they also feel renting is not sustainable not satisfactory. 

I feel U.S. culture is different. Many smart Americans (including some middle-class) stay renting long-term by choice.

These could contribute to performance drags.

Allocated column is more useful than SIZE column as it is after-Compression

-- fuxi: why do I care so much that my long emails are not "well-received"? I told myself that those mails are similar to personal diary. I also told the recipients the same.
Somehow I need to accept it even more wholeheartedly. Remember Wei.Li
