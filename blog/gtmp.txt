AMB looks so daunting but someday I will find the traction/vision
Re my mail to Edmund, most retail investors have not found any vision.
boy's math coaching... My new vision secret is .. put aside benchmarks and try to increase his intrinsic motivation by 1%. Possibly insignificant, but better than nothing.
muscle-up looks so daunting but remember chin-up 100/D was daunting too

-- fuxi or update tuxedo post
at raffles place I see lots of young, well-dressed (mostly financial) professionals in their 20s and 30s. 
I feel many are spoilt kids. But I think many come from poorer backgrounds perhaps in 3rd-world countries.
Many are ambitious in the rat race.
When I was their age (20+) I was on the sideline, as a manufacturing engineer and later blue-collar programmer. I had excellent burn rate control (unaware), competitive on theoretical domains (unaware) but in the less lucrative domains.

adaptation .. I have gone a long way in my adaptation for and within the fin-IT domain. I have figured out how to survive the competition, how to gain an unfair advantage...
4def .. At the earlier age, I was mostly driven by successC
deathbed .. successE beats successC
life chances .. The higher income has indeed provided more life chances to me and my kids.

-- slow-cooking new: shame and smear campaign
eg 1: Dick Cheney worried about his gay daughter getting exposed if he were to run for presidency and attract the spot light.
eg 2: Trump attacking Biden's younger son during Debate 1

In many jury-based systems, the lawyers would try smear campaign on the key individual + key witnesses on the opposite side, in an effort to discredit them.

Imagine your loved ones becoming the target. Any unusual habits would be used to bring shame on them.

"astra" theme (free) is recommended. 
if you want precise control (me), then prefer non-template, and classic editor.

widget config is generic. theme config would overwrite widget config

-- fuxi: drawing board
No choice elsewhere, as far as we know.
The only choice we know:
* Mala board + Mala markers

How I decided to return it on Sat? 夜长梦多. 
Should have called ikea to ask about marker. We didn't have the foresight to know that some special marker exists for this surface.
On Sat, it was an easy and safe option to carry the board back and refund. Greedy algorithm.
