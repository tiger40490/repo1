-- new: %%prejudie: China's innovation
I have a growing prejudice that China is a immitator, follower not an innovator as Americans and Europeans are. But consider

* 拿来主义 is positive attitude. A country too arrogant to 放下身段 and adopt other cultures will pay a price and decline.
* Japan is the first Asian country to open up and reform to adopt western systems ...
* The west also picked up many things from India, East Asian cultures...

Math (and comp science to some extent) .. China didn't invent any, but China students have very strong foundations.

==== new kindness
I see myself as a kind person. Kindness is one of the G3 essential traits of a good person, a decent person, or a high-quality person. You want kind individuals in your team, in your family.

Each thinking person's yardstick of kindness is slightly different from the mainstream yardstick.

Perhaps the most important element is .. kindness to family. 

Missing element in many yardksticks is the Question -- Is the person kind to himself or herself. Does she like herself?

Are you kind to your coworkers? Look at Larry vs deMunk 

For an employee on any people-facing job, I think it's easy to be kind to his customers/users, because he is trained, paid (and monitored) to do so. Negative feedback (complaints etc) is prompt, recorded, and analyzed with plenty of guidance, so he will receive plenty of "support" to correct his behavior.

In some positions (such as law enforcement), kindness is probably less important than fairness.

恶有恶报 -- one of the most powerful "laws of the universe".

I'm also a good husband. Many otherwise kind man are unfaithful.

-- morality .. more strict than kindness
A leader needs moral compass, so kindness is less important.

Why NYU has so many alumni on WallSt, even though not a top 20 college?
Why HK has so many "top financial professionals" out of a tiny population?
Why U.S. produces most of the top basketball players, out of 4% of world population?

Answer: contexx or opportunity to develop talents.

Sg gov pick upstream domains like financial, life science, digital tech, and bring in multinationals who provide the skill-upgrading contexx to Singaporeans.

-- fuxi ... or update some post on carefree
Since Sep/Oct I feel my carefree ezlife is diminishing/declining/// in some strange way. It takes effort to explain it

The DIYHI created lots of conflicts, self-blame, zsms about tcost, involution.

Then kids' math exam results ..

In the grand scheme of things, these pains/unhappy episodes would pass.
The "carefree" felt so short-lived, but hopefully, it soon returned.
