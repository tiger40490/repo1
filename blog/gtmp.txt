-- update one of the bposts on forgetful
Push to 100% compliance of this rule -- always put the phone (spectacles similar) in the usual place. Each time you deviate, there's a 2% chance of leave it behind.

-- fuxi: On 28 Feb, F.Fu lost his job while I received a huge bonus payout, derived my YoY asset growth,,, I wonder what are the truly important shields that protect my livelihood high ground relative to the wider population
* wellness
* burn rate .. many have pointed out
* in-demand profile on finDev market .. my skills are still relevant, but my age is a growing concern.

--fuxi: 
The nei4juan3 situation is dysfunctional, but each individual's action is actually rational.

When the 'system' is dysfunctional, perfectly rational individuals would contribute to the crazy rat race.

I told Yifei about my conscious career decisions in WallSt finDev -- I decided not to join the rat race or compete for higher salary, primarily because I don't have talent for that game. I also lack the drive.

I told Yifei about my career decisions in quant domain -- I found too many bright poeple competing for a shrinking pie (pie being profit pool). I felt it was nei4juan3 and stopped investing my time, but my initial decision to enroll was not nei4juan3, because I had the talent and I saw the potential for higher value-add, or higher utilization of my talent. Now I think this might be similar to the BAT SWE guys. They don't mind 996 or low value-add if the salary is good.

I feel lucky that I didn't need to suffer 996, but some people feel lucky that they can earn the 996 salary.

Yifei's main point -- these professionals have no better choice. The 996 nei3juan3 jobs pay really well, provide a trec, keep your skillset current, make you an eligible bachelor,,,

Yifei pointed out another factor -- I never felt insufficient earning for my livelihood. In contrast, the nei4juan3 guys had a mountain to climb -- buying a home in a Tier 1 city.

some of the weaknesses I overcame with (at least) twice the effort 
Chinese compo
Eng listening and oral
driving practice
swimming
cycling
yoga

-- new: temp jobs: 
I tend to perceive temp jobs positively, as learning.

many unlucky job seekers end up working on temp jobs. No job security, low pay, limited trec
eg: Chinese immigrants to Canada
eg: Shuo in 1997 after graduation
eg: my temp jobs in 2005
eg: many of the jobless 2023 graduates from China universities

If you don't worry about livelihood, then you can enroll in a training program instead.

-- fuxi: no_time ~= no_Absorbency
academic coaching .. requires lots of absorbency, patience
household chores .. requires absorbency and physical effort 
Affliate Marketing Program .. require s absorbency
seeking (and following) counsellor help .. requires absorbency. "Following" is classic zqbx self-improvement.
