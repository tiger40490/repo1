-- update bpost about inferiority
If I'm a CAD patient in Japan, I may worry about my country's quality of medical care. I would worry that Japan doctors are not fluent enough in English...

The pattern -- whichever group I find myself in, I tend to worry about its calibre and quality. 

-- fuxi: Tokyo subway tickets
At many subway stations, the fare charts include two versions. Version 1 is (probbly simpler map) same-company. Version 2 is cross-company.

Eg: From Tawaramachi to Asakusa, there are two types of tickets

1) same-company (cheaper)... If you travel (including transfers) entirely within one company's network, then you won't need a connecting ticket.
2) cross-company (higher cost) i.e. connecting ticket .. If there is any transfer between two networks like between Toei and TokyoMetro, then you need to exit one system Before you can enter the other system. At the "other system" entrance, your type 1 ticket would fail!

-- udate post on mlphone hotspot
Issue: NoSim. I had to connect to a wifi to set up SIM
Issue: other devices can't detect this SSID. I had to disable-then-enable it on mlphone

Once another device connects to this SSID, mlphone shows a green banner on top.

Privacy!

tolerance of kids .. Accept the dire situation. 

If I lose this job, I could consider a PSA type of stable job, or simply retire and take up some ikigai that I enjoy (what?)

I feel lucky about my sgCitizenship over HK/China citizenship [cpf, inflation, investing overseas, ]

-- fuxi: facing several mild stressors [aging parents, kids' academics, discipline,,,] I feel my pff efforts are partially helpful (glass half-full rather than half-empty).

* pff has proven a positive recreation, but not overseas rEstate .. too risky
* pff does generate alpha that contribute to a sense of pff security
* in my old age, the above positive effect could become more important
* pff is a valuable conversation topic with kids and with friends.

Livelihood stressors do arise every year, and pff effort becomes more relevant.

Financial literacy (a different phase) is important for everyone, including my family members.

-- new: trust]gov system: Sgp^Chn #SAFE
SAFE has a published policy that allows each banking customer in China to withdraw up to Rmb 100k/Y from overseas ATMs.

If you withdraw R99,950 and incur R1100 fees, then do you exceed the quota?

I believe answer is No. Should be completely legit. If a Singapore system finds fault in me, I can dispute or appeal.

However, with China system, it depends. Most mainland Chinese people dare not challenge the system. It might take a lot of legwork. 

In Singapore, the government department always has a hotline if the regulation directly affects individual citizens. The hotline usually give clear answers to guide my decision (a citizen). If things don't work out as explained, I can raise a complaint (as I did many times). Within weeks they would reach out to me and address my complaint.

In China (and U.S.), the goverment department tends to be understaffed (esp. U.S.), unable to deal with 1.4 billion citizens, let alone foreigners. 

U.S. (and PRC) government hotlines are always hard to get through and often give useless answers. We have to rely on private consultants. Whatever the source of information, if we follow it but it doesn't work, then we face an uphill battle. The government department is unlikely to offer any help. You will have to jump through many, many hoops to get it resolved.

According to DJDJ legal assistance, the SAFE gov hotline is familiar with foreign passport holders taking out inheritance.
