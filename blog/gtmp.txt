--new jolt low-energy on work projects
t_intro
I now feel low-energy (low-absorbency is a second descriptor) on work projects. However, at the same time I could feel high-absorbency on workout (or diet), QQ (or coding drill), parenting,,,

These other absorbency domains are arguably more strategic, so the current situation (as described) is actually better than the "average" situation which features no high-absorbency on any front whatsoever.

Is it possible to have high-absorbency on all fronts? Unlikely. Therefore, recognize your priorities, embrace the imperfect self, and celebrate the improved-imperfect situation.

--shall I replace the water spray pipe preemptively?
Looks like the existing pipe has known quality issue.

--new jolt: family outing: extremely low roti,high tcost

The Cigna counsellors advocate family outing for stress relief and family bonding. I agree, but I don't think it is the most efficient. It is legitimate pleasure for sure. (Can we reduce it to once in two weeks? Just give some excuse like weather, appointments...)

In a way, people (average or high intelligence) save money exactly for pleasures such as this pleasure. I guess it's important to be aware of the tcost, although the awareness can create stress, guilt... 

Analogy -- I think before we enjoy a fancy meal, we need at least some awareness of the high $cost and BMI cost. Life is mostly about pain, duty, effort, livelihood,,, and much less pleasure.

family outing also entails high BMI cost.

--new jolt: fixation@brank^topSchool
I have a fixation on brank [1] precisely because I can't achieve it.
Fellow parents have a fixation on branded schools becasue they couldn't achieve it

How about beautiful wife? I don't envy anyone because I have my beautiful wife.

[1] also the fast track, the OC-effectiveness

--risk of pipe burst when we are out
get a stronger spray tube or get a professional?

--set permitted usage for boy's Rob account

--fuxi: the space below window /sill/
is a source of pain as I couldn't find productive use

One idea is to a cabinet

Another idea is move the window out.

All the above ideas cost quite a bit. One cheap use of it is as temporary storage.

--bigger watermelons were handpicked by supplier
In my experience the smaller watermelons are more likely to be low quality

--ask wife and kids to help make 6 color hats
One of them is probably least used. If I actually wear it I may be nudged to think in that direction.

--The windowsUpdate problem is AA) recurring BB) without simple and reliable solution CC) bothers ME particularly

The only solution I found so far is landGrab. I felt silly to spend hours setting up the tools to support landGrab. zsms! The zsms is annoying to say the least.

I feel CSY's view on coding practice is similar in that he probably feels silly to spend months on it, but he just couldn't find any better solution to this huge and immediate problem. 

In contrast, Deepak has a positive attitude. Some may say that over 3 years, Deepak won't improve to get ahead of CSY, but who are we to judge. Life is full of surprises. Deepak will improve as long as he keeps up the practice, and someday he will get lucky.

Actually, my windowsUpdate situation is better than CSY's situation, becasue I have a working solution.

--counsellor chat on meimei phone addiction
family outing to reduce screen addiction. Cycling with dad is similar. watching a movie at home together could be counted as family time, and perhaps much better than "phone screen time".

seek parenting help in KKH

try to reduce the (angry) outburst to a smaller flow. 

My discipline on meimei is loose, but it could be a good thing, as my strict confrontational stance breeds anger. Anger is loss of control.

I tend to feel the common advice and strategies won't help.

--update blogposts on hib: immigration plan change
I am overly pessimistic about my son's judgement, self-control, risk of drug influence. His self-esteem and self-confidence may go lower because of my parenting attitude and manifastation through my words

Overprotective parenting -- against bad influence in U.S. youth culture. I tend to see my son as completely defenseless, lacking basic judgement. In fact, SG environment also has bad influences... When I came to SG from China I experienced lots of stress.

I need to accept the risk(s) of each choice I make. 

Counsellor pointed out the heavy PIP stress in my job would affect my parenting and therefore my kids!

--fuxi: in old age, grandparents would deal with lack of family support partly because of an earlier chocie -- decades ago they encouraged their children to go overseas.

This is a big sacrifice made by thousands of families in China.

For the last 50 years in China, each family member chooses the city to stay, largely based on livelihood reasons. My wife and I would probably choose the U.S. or SG. My sister chose Australia. Grandparents choose Beijing.

This level of individual freedom comes at a price -- physical separation of family. 

(t_ffreelimitation) If physical contact is important to you, and if you can afford it, you would want to fly (business class) more often, take more leaves, or take lower-paying jobs to live close to grandparents.

--fuxi: when grandpa is gone then grandma would not be used to the solitude. I think she would want to live with me and my kids

--fuxi: to give more support to grandparents
both are becoming my dependents. 

identify the cycle of ineffective handling of challenges. 

Sugg: make time and create mental energy reserve by reducing the fixation on boy.
