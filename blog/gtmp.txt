-- call DBS to cancel grandpa's card, for safety
-- call Ohio State tax
-- new: speak slowly when..
when speaking to someone new
when speaking on the phone rather than face to face
when spaking about something sensitive or important

.. no one speaks too slowly. Most peopel including me speak too fast.

-- new: longRest->tempRecovery
More than one laptop has shown "longRest->recovery".
I had to power down for many days to get a few hours or longer recovery from a defect.

This pattern has many implications.

Periodically, we had better bring out each laptop to use for a while. This sentence is vague until I point out 1) oxidation and 2) longRest->recovery.

A slighly defective laptop (eg: A299) can be used in place of a new laptop to prolong the latter's shelf life.
-- update: each time I feel luck cf my peers, it's usually 
* workload
* comp + benefits
* investment gains
* welfare
* edu credentials .. ascent of NUS

in a 2022 nightmare, I rejoined Macq and was dismissed again. 
I did my best but again was the weakest in the team.

In hind sight, the job requirement was simply too high.
How about AshS in his CTO job? CSDoctor's job? S.Liu's job? YY.Tao's job?

If I were to benchmark myself with so-called peers, try to increase my brank, and join the exclub, I would get derailed, lose my carefree ezlife, take on lots of stress. 
If I try, could I become an architect? Not my strength.
If I try, could I become a lead developer like Ash.S? Not sure. Ash.S seems to take on too much.

At my age, I have an implicit self-conviction that most of the higher-paying positions are too stressful, with exorbitant expectation.
What I'm unsure is the salary spread. What additional income is possible? After tax, 100k/Y additional? Not worth it.

I told grandpa that my successE [carefree ezlife + harmony, based on wellness and comfortable livelihood] is rare among my cohort, not because I'm better off than them, but because I don't focus on the wrong goals.

The nightmare scenario is much more severe than CB2022

Larry has higher income than me. He really likes OhioState for both his kids. Ken (manager of the RTS client-side dev team) .. also sent his kids to a state university, citing cost as one factor.

So why would an immigrant insist on the ivy league?

Larry can afford private colleges, but I feel he didn't see the justification for the higher cost.

Many things are not-absolutely-necessary rather than "unnecessary".

-- new: killer talent, or update bpost on personal adv
More than once I imagine that an individual is really mediocre except in one thing, and on that one thing he/she makes a comfortable living, possibly supporting a family. 
By "mediore" I mean this person is below average on many important things and barely above average on others.

celebrities are the most visible example -- commercially very successful based on one killer talent, but I have to exclude them for this characterization to be relevant to me.

Leaders [most managers] are by definition multi-talented.

I'm good at JIV, but it is simplistic (and unfair) to say I'm barely above average in my studies, wellness, pff, marriage, bonding with my kids,,

I think speed coding could be a killer talent... useful in CIV, irrelevant on the job.

How about piano teaching? Note piano skill can't provide a livelihood, but piano teaching can.
How about math tution?

-- new: scientific claim: TCM, yoga 
Science theories are always refutable; non-scientific theories are often non-refutable.
I always believed TCM is proven over centuries but how about lianhua qingwen? 
It is probably proven effective at treating symptoms but there is a different acid test on the effectiveness at treating covid infection.

yoga has proven benefits but how it helps me is very hard to prove.
The meditation part is even harder to prove.
-- update tiny Lifestyle 升?
My lotus@mrt practice is improving.
I now sit on a plastic bag, so my pants are well-protected and my worry and suspicion about invisible dirt is significantly reduced.

I stitched my pockets to be handphone-friendly

-- fuxi (too vague to become a bpost): I have adapted to my living environment
No longer dependent on library
no longer dependent on stadium
Compared to 2018, I have increased yoga self-practice
I can now jog in many simple shoes, or barefoot
I can now use stairs, lunges, skip rope
I now use more of thin bar, yoga block, exercise mat
-- fuxi or update: for the tiny laptop, touch-screen is less valuable
usage is usually short-duration (below 1 hour 90% of the time).

However, when using the tiny laptop in office, the touch-screen convenience might help me avoid sending emails out of MLP

-- fuxi (no good bpost name): 2nd big problem
Imagine you have been struggling against a serious personal disadvantage in a new place, you then notice another personal disadvantage. It would look worse than it actually is. Your self-esteem (self-image) is already compromised and vulnerable before this second blow.

A few powerful examples:

eg: when I first came to SG. I struggled with English. Then I notice my age is older than my classmates.
eg: when I first came to U.S. I struggled with "status" and (mostly tech) interview. Then I notice my wife's lack of education and English skills.
eg: When Satya (MSFT CEO) and wife had their first child with a problem, he took it in his stride. Then his second child also needed a lot of help, as he said in an interview.

when we see new foreign products advertized in Singapore, we often see "top-selling in <countryABC>". For food, fashion products, immediately I wonder "would it be a hit or a flop in this local market?"

It depends on the cultural affinity between the originating country and the target country.

I see good affinity between Japan and Sgp, between China and Sgp for food innovation only, between U.S. and Europe, between U.S. and Latam thanks to the large Latino population in U.S.

Which country has the best track record and best chance of bridging the most culture gaps? I feel U.S. is above the rest, followed by Europe, and then Japan.
