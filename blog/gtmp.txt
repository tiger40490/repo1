-- textbook on calculus is too heavy and not worth carrying. Perhaps I can read a bit to build up my high-level knowledge for influence.

Why do I feel so alone/disconnected/unusual among my peers in terms of my "carefree ezlife"?
It is invariably a combination of factors. 

* my apreciation[confidence] of my SG citizenship.. perhaps rare among my peers. This "shield" gives me a confidence very different from that of my WSt friends.
* stable marriage + good bonding with kids .. is shared with perhaps half my peers
* wellness ... (all aspects) is relatively rare among my peers
* career longevity [dev-till70] ... very rare among techies, and also somewhat rare across the entire cohort.
* cashflow high ground .. the most visible among all factors. Indeed rare among my peers

-- fuxi or new: double trip to fetch phone left at home
Today I left my mobile phone at home, so I came to office and quickly decided to go back and fetch it. 
In the same context, I used to feel bitter/resentful precisely because I focused on the negative side
* family members unable to help me.
* I would have to pay a few dollars fare
* I have just arrived in office and have not done any work
* I must return to office (rather than working from home) due to a meeting [PMA walk through]
* I will miss a 3pm meeting, though I could try to dial in on my commute

Just 2 or 3 items were enough to paint the whole thing black.

Instead, I focused on positive elements
* my workload is low, without urgent deliverables
* my work hours are more flexible than most jobs
* my commute is rather short, with minimal walk on both ends
* I could read on the train, with a seat

This is a simple and powerful illustration of positive perception.

--new reputation of Singapore public/private colleges.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_universities_in_Singapore lists 6 "official" universities + dozens of private degree programs. The latter are joint ventures with foreign universities, such that the degree is conferred by the foreign university.

What's the #1 yardstick to guage these universities? I would say reputation. Reputation is measured in many ways. Many of them are related to quality, but it's quite possible that UniA has better quality than UniB but lower reputation. 

The new universities and private universities struggle to establish credibility/reputation, which they need in order to attract 1) students 2) employers/sponsors. 

Long history and large student intake help name recognition. Even non-positive associations can help build name recognition. A college with such a name recognition must be reasonably good to survive 100 years.

NTU engineering may be better quality in edu, and more research output than NUS engineering, but in terms of reputation, recognition, a longer history does matter.

Same for STDU engineering

I don't want to waste my (reusable) frames even though Cigna pays everything. It's a waste of resources, and also indirectly raises premium.

-- update bpost on glamourous women
Emily Chang was one of the most attractive women in the world -- young, bright, bold, an Asian female (and gorgeous) face in male-dominated Silicon Valley... a breath of fresh air.

Then her appearance grew old. 
I feel more than 60% of the audience is male, and males are attracted by a young, pretty face.

I guess a mainstream, competitive global media power house that's the flagship of Bloomberg's entire technology franchise can't have a 40-something women as the figurehead.

-- update dean's list bpost
We all have limited laser energy, unable to examine every concept. The NUS dean's list concept is poorly (never critcially) examined and allowed to roam free, and often dominate my self-assessment of JLCJ

The 1stClassHonors concept is also poorly examined, and served to reinforce the same self-assessment.

However, I tend to dismiss or forget my book prize, my UChicago GPA, my 2Y EDB full scholarship, my academic achievements before and after NUS. 

A DeansList recipient may also suffer a JLCJ inferiority. He may point out that he only won twice, out of luck. He may lament about his current income, or his interview performance, 

-- update ... some post on carefree
Since Sep/Oct I feel my carefree ezlife is diminishing/declining/// in some strange way. It takes effort to explain it

The DIYHI created lots of conflicts, self-blame, zsms about tcost, involution.

Then kids' math exam results ..

In the grand scheme of things, these pains/unhappy episodes would pass fairly soon.
The "carefree" felt so short-lived, but hopefully, it can return soon.

Q: did I or do I still neglect anything? Let's avoid the vague or familiar answers.

Flexibility? I no longer neglect.
chin-up training? I now pay more attention. Never really "neglected"
flossing? I now pay more attention
risk of job search difficulties?

Consider a male China-born immigration lawyer , or architect, SWE, (various) designer,,,, whoc came to the U.S. at age 25. He can be competent/effective/proficient in English professionally [in office, with clients, in meetings, over phone]. However, a less-educated local American would be more fluent orally.

SG was behind HK in talent, as HK draws talents from China + the west.
Now SG is becoming more attractive than HK for many nationalities:
* SEAsia
* India
* the West
* Japan?

~~ some long-term disadvantages of sg 
vulnerable to global warming
burning oil to generate electricity
limited fresh water supply .. even though gov is working effectively on reservoirs, river cleaning, catchment
very limited scale in some job domains. For those interested in those domains, they may need to work overseas.
over-dependent on foreign workers and foreign talents
food insecurity
