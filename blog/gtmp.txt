-- new: ex-classmates' husbands or update left-behind
When I think of a female ex-classmate, I often ask myself what kind of husband they have. I don't know any of those husbands, but I usually assume them to be 高富帅. An invented inferiority! 

How about BMI and belly? I bet half of them are inferior.
How about active days/week? I bet most of them are inferior.
How about bonding with the kids? I probably fare better than half of them.
How about retirement healthcare and income? 
How about career longevity?
How about nonwork income? 

What's more important in a husband -- brank or health?
What kind of father and role model do you want for your kids if you are one of these ex-classmates?

Why HK has so many "top financial professionals" out of a tiny local population (excluding foreigners)?
Why U.S. produces most of the top basketball players, out of 4% of world population?
Why such a high concentration of Nobel Econs prizes in UChicago, Harvard and MIT? These universities are at the forefront.
Why such a high concentration of English-speaking movie stars, even though the 5 English speaking countries add up to below 400M population only.  

Answer: contexx or opportunity to develop talents.

Sg gov pick upstream domains like financial, life science, digital tech, and bring in multinationals who provide the skill-upgrading contexx to Singaporeans.

-- new: %%prejudie: China's innovation
I have a growing prejudice that China is a immitator, follower not an innovator as Americans and Europeans are. But consider

* 拿来主义 is positive attitude. A country too arrogant to 放下身段 and adopt other cultures will pay a price and decline.
* Japan is the first Asian country to open up and reform to adopt western systems ...
* The west also picked up many things from India, East Asian cultures...

Math (and comp science to some extent) .. China didn't invent any, but China students have very strong foundations.

case study: when I researched on "richest country of latam", I was drawn into the different ways to measure national wealth. Unplanned. Energy sink !

-- update germany universities ranking
I believe that German system doesn't try to allocate resources to one top university to increase its international ranking. German universities are reported "much more uniform". This means that if you only look at the very top, you will see a few US universities but not a single German one. At the same time any German university would count as fairly good compared to the average US university.

If you want a university that scores in the top 10 internationally, a necessary but insufficient condition is an amount of funding similar to the current top 10. No German university is anywhere close to that amount of money and the German government, which provides the bulk of their funding, is (currently) not interested in giving out that amount of funding to a single university. 

==== new kindness
I see myself as a kind person. Kindness is one of the G3 essential traits of a good person, a decent person, or a high-quality person. You want kind individuals in your team, in your family.

Each thinking person's yardstick of kindness is slightly different from the mainstream yardstick.

Perhaps the most important element is .. kindness to family. 

Missing element in many yardksticks is the Question -- Is the person kind to himself or herself. Does she like herself?

Are you kind to your coworkers? Look at Larry vs deMunk 

For an employee on any people-facing job, I think it's easy to be kind to his customers/users, because he is trained, paid (and monitored) to do so. Negative feedback (complaints etc) is prompt, recorded, and analyzed with plenty of guidance, so he will receive plenty of "support" to correct his behavior.

In some positions (such as law enforcement), kindness is probably less important than fairness.

恶有恶报 -- one of the most powerful "laws of the universe".

I'm also a good husband. Many otherwise kind man are unfaithful.

-- morality .. more strict than kindness
A leader needs moral compass, so kindness is less important.

Whenever someone makes a proposition and says it is scientifically proven, we can ask 

Q: Who proved it? 
Q: Are they scientists in this domain? (Credentials?)
Q: Is the result/data peer-reviewed? 
Q: Who are those peers?

I think in social sciences including psychology, peer review is even more important than in natural sciences

-- fuxi ... or update some post on carefree
Since Sep/Oct I feel my carefree ezlife is diminishing/declining/// in some strange way. It takes effort to explain it

The DIYHI created lots of conflicts, self-blame, zsms about tcost, involution.

Then kids' math exam results ..

In the grand scheme of things, these pains/unhappy episodes would pass.
The "carefree" felt so short-lived, but hopefully, it soon returned.
