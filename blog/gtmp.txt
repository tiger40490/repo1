-- update quadrants (not the full list)
In a stressful morning, 4-corner paper beats the quadrant webpage when I need to lay out all my concerns in front of me

-- slow-cooking new wiki^recoll
Active scratchpads can be implemented as a wiki, or a file in a recoll directory tree.

A wiki (including my blog) is first and foremost an info display system, so you can keep a page open forever, as one of 20 open browser tabs. If needed, you could start an hour-long edit session, but eventually, you must save and publish. Most of the time the document is in Published mode, not Edit mode.

A recoll is data storage. The Edit GUI and Display GUI are the same thing, not separate as on a web browser. Therefore, we don't display a recoll file forever because there is a real risk of unwanted edit when we don't know how to roll back.

A recoll has more flexible organization. A wiki tree is kinda similar, but my blog is not. My blog relies on categories and tags.

Q: given the cashflow high ground, how could H.Yi improve their marriage and communication.

A: professional couple counselling. This service costs a lot in the U.S.
A: hire a maid to reduce the home-making workload on each parent

Perhaps emmigrate to a lower-income country where systems are less complex and everyday life simpler and more convenient.

Suprisingly, the high ground doesn't provide enough of a buffer of protection against marital risks. The high ground improves risks related to family cashflow, but the high-earning wife is also very independent and doesn't want to play a supporting role to the husband. Not a risk factor in itself, but in some cases, this can indirectly create new risks. Many divorce cases involve two high-income earners.

A lower-class stable couple look at the higher-class the Yi's with envy. But would the Yi's envy the stable marriage of the lower-class couple? I think Yi's xpSelf would. 

-- slow-cooking new: 2nd big problem
Imagine you have been struggling against a serious personal disadvantage in a new place, you then notice another personal disadvantage. It would look worse than it actually is. Your self-esteem (self-image) is already compromised and vulnerable before this second blow.

A few key examples:

eg: when I first came to SG. I struggled with English. Then I notice my age is older than my classmates.
eg: when I first came to U.S. I struggled with "status" and (mostly tech) interview. Then I notice my wife's lack of education and English skills.
