-- new: fixation on high school ranking

China gaokao is an object, nation-wide benchmark, usable as a benchmark to rank thousands of high schools. Usable doesn't mean "meaningful"

Why rank universities by the number of research output including awards? Because universities exist to lead research. Academic impact is a sign of excellence and value-creation.

Why rank unviersity by graduate employment, and employer recognition? Because universities exist to educate and produce young, productive knowledge-workers.

Universities build/polish their brands, and use their brands to attract staff, students, funding[donation,grants,,]. In any domain, brands would compete for mind share. 

There's an emotional motivation among alumni to monitor and boost a schools branding[and ranking]

Do these factor apply to high schools?

After listening to congcong situation, my focus shifted to "howLuckyIWasAsStudent" .. lucky and confident

I feel the China gaokao system is a ruthless pyramid with poor upward mobility -- 

* stratification among colleges has probably increased with 985/211. Even though some 2nd/3rd tier college graduates do become "successful" (successC), parents and the society at large ignore them as statistical outliers
* top high schools have a near "supply monopoly" to top colleges

In China middle schools, if you want to top collge, then your chance is low if you don't get into a top high school. Average high schools seldom produce such strong candidates for gaokao. I went though high school system myself and I know it.
In China high schools, if you want a top college, then you must work hard for 3 years, but by default,, you would get into a decent college.

-- update ... bpost on longevity? which one?
My ffree calc, my devTill70 plan, my 95 longevity target ,,, all have an implicit assumption of /adequate/ health.

Are these plans simplistic?

I think some dose of optimism is good. Positive thinking. Specific, measurable goals are better goals. 
Resilience is a foundation of this optimism. 

In my declining years, I need human support more than financial support. I feel Sgp system provides more human support. In another country, even with a million dollars, you can't get sufficient support. 
You will feel lucky/unlucky primarily due to your health and your support network, rather than pff or brank.

Still, career longevity is crucial as it provides social interaction in addition to an income stream.

In the last few (up to 12) months, my subconscious definition of success has shifted from successE to successZ.
Why zqbx? It's becuase of challenges. 
I think my challenges are real, not frivolous complaints of a spoilt kid.
They require zqbx, resilient attitude and continuous effort
