-- update bpost on college ranking
QS is more about reputation, but they miss the key point " Reputation is always local including national, seldom international. "

For an international student choosing a college to apply, QS meets the requirement, comparing the reputation globally.

For a domestic student looking across her own country (India, China, or U.S.), the local ranking by national agencies are overriding. The national ranking may put BB well above AA (whereas internal rankings put AA above BB), and the local student would usually ignore international ranking.

In fact, international students mostly choose high quality universities, so the percentage of international students is a valid yardstick.

Shanghai ranking is more stable.

-- new or update bpost on brush-off
reflections on the 92S27 reunion in May 2022

I told grandpa later on "not worthy of my envy: their cars, expensive homes, maids, top schools for offspring". These are often white elephants. 
This is part of my emerging wisdom as an older intellectual.

I also told grandpa that my skills are in demand, with market depth in a growing sector. 
I want to actively reduce attachment to the EPA comfort zone.

I tend to brush off my advantages in diet, workout, bonding with kids, brbr, cashflow high ground, continuous learning.
Many of my advantages over these ex-classmates are in successE and successZ.

In whatever that matter to me, I don't feel left behind. I am getting ahead.

-- new: dependency@AC ++
I now feel slightly less guilty about my growing dependency on AC.

(Is there anything NOK to switch on/off frequently? No evidence.)

Dependency on AC is very common, so commercial support is widespread.
Dependency on car is ditto, but the commercial support is pricier.

Dependency on wireless connectivity is very common, but you depend on other people most of the time.
Dependency on wpress is uncommon
Dependency on NY/NJ subway is common during peak hours only. Extra dependency on it is uncommon.

-- update bpost on commute
Need to balance 2 priorities (3 would be max)
logistical efficiency .. printed material (without need4writing) is far more efficient than laptop esp. for short trips or with transfers
productivity zsms .. laptop with coding or tech QQ, or tech books 

When is best time for git-blogg? Looks like an unwanted child. Commute is a good choice, even if not the very best.
When is best time for my growing recreational books? In office and home

-- fuxi (no good bpost name): 2nd big problem
Imagine you have been struggling against a serious personal disadvantage in a new place, you then notice another personal disadvantage. It would look worse than it actually is. Your self-esteem (self-image) is already compromised and vulnerable before this second blow.

A few powerful examples:

eg: when I first came to SG. I struggled with English. Then I notice my age is older than my classmates.
eg: when I first came to U.S. I struggled with "status" and (mostly tech) interview. Then I notice my wife's lack of education and English skills.
eg: When Satya (MSFT CEO) and wife had their first child with a problem, he took it in his stride. Then his second child also needed a lot of help, as he said in an interview.

-- new: marriage: deep conversations, shared activity
Shared activity ... I can't think of any (besides our weekly family outings). I try to join her on her solo trips to the nearby supermarket. At best it is a 20-minute activity. Her hobbies include watching Korean dramas, online shopping, and visiting department stores,... but I don't share those hobbies.

You mentioned regular deep conversation and quality time. Indeed our bonding has improved because we now have many quiet mornings on weekdays when kids are in school and I work the afternoon shift. Quiet mornings are precious and probably unsustainable because my wife is planning to get a regular job. Outside these quiet mornings, I don't recall any quality time. Our conversations are never really deep, but when we were alone together long enough (during quiet mornings), we have the opportunity to talk about non-trivial topics at length. Other people can't imagine how hard it is for my wife to sustain a focused conversation beyond 10 minutes. On any topic, she would quickly come to a conclusion and have no patience to hear my words. 

Suppose the topic is our new home. She could sustain only a 15-min chat on the "Renovation" topic (close to her heart). However, if there are several sub-topics like 1) shower-screen 2)flooring 3)timeline 4)risk management 5)budget... then she can sustain a 5-minute chat on each sub-topic.  In fact, "risk" and "budget" are vague topics for her. She has problems going in-depth on these abstract topics. She can sustain longer conversations on the "wall tile" topic.

Another example of a concrete topic is a vacation to, say, Bali. 
Another example of a vague, broad topic is how to help kids with academics (in her mind, that means nothing but grades).
Another example of a vague, broad topic is how to improve communications between the 2 of us.

These examples (except the "communications" topic) are some of the rather few topics of interest to her. In contrast, 90% of my favorite conversation topics (shared with my friends) are too boring to her, too abstract, too technical, too big. Though she has a diploma, her intellectual curiosity is like a high school girl. It is reflected in her conversation topics. I didn't mention that she is interested in K-pop, shopping, make-up, and fashion for kids, but I have zero interest therein.

I said in our first chat that "meaningful conversations" is a visible weakness in this marriage. I have been disappointed too many times so I have given up on it. However, the depth of conversations (or lack thereof) in my marriage is not a serious problem. 

A chatting partner is a different relationship altogether. I often have chatting partners at work or among ex-colleagues/ex-classmates. I feel intimate enough to share lots of personal thoughts, but we don't depend on each other for livelihood.

In contrast, there are important relationships that are not built on in-depth conversations. For example, a relationship between 2 joint owners of a business, or relationship between two siblings, or relationship between a boss and her only worker (in a team of two) can all be functional, supportive, and effective despite a lack of in-depth conversations. 

I agree with you that a majority of successful, fulfilling marriages feature the chatting-partner relationship, but believe it's not a make-or-break feature.
