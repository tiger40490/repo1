Schopenhauer : "The capacity to be alone is one of the most distinctive marks of a high intellectual being."

Many depend on other people or service providers to keep them /entaintained/ and engaged. 
I used to envy those ex-classmates, ex-colleagues who travel widely for sight-seeing. 
Now I think they resemble my bored-stricken kids -- they are to various extent dependent on the new experiences to keep them (stimulated) feeling alive. 
More than half the intellectuals I admire are not so dependent.
My father is the best-understood example. He enjoys sight-seeing but is completely fine with the (pandemic) travel restrictions.

writing, painting, sculpture, music-making, reading, some singing (in my experience) .. is solitary. My long emails are semi-solitary. Social media apps are not. They require another person to respond in real time.

retirement .. solitude is valuable. Physical self-reliance is probably the foundation of solitude. 

Nomadland is an introspective journey about solitude.

Many Buddhists advocate detachment, self-reliance and the impermanence of close relationships. Stay Connected in bad times like covid19? Sure but watch out for overreliance.

--new: waste of water/energy/$ in the family
I always feel guilty about wasting water, energy or (more frequently) hard-earned money.

I still waste some, every now and then, but I don't give up and accept my wasteful acts. 99% of the people around me (mostly Chinse) don't care as much as I do. I often feel most folks simply don't care about "small" wastes. 

My family members seem to do the same. That's the reality I need to accept.

I still want to improve my own habits + my family members' habits in this regard, but I always overestimate my ability to change them. I'm stubborn in my refusal to accept that "reality". 

This is possibly at the root of endless commmunication failures. The cost is rather high in terms of harmony, family bond, and happy marriage.

ML.Jiang once told me about some classmates. A Chinese national and a Korean national living in Singapore as a couple, who spoke Japanese at home.

I was impressed.

Immediately I assumed that they speak mostly Japanese between them and their Japanese fluency is equal to their mother tongue.

Well, DaShan the Canadian in China is one in probably 1000 foreigners who speak such fluent Chinese. So to a Japanese national, both of them probably sound non-Japanese.

The less you know someone, the more you assume... Remember HY.Cai

Paramjeet Kaur was charged for her defiance towards mask-wearing regulation during circuit breaker. 

Appearing in court, she only wore mask below her nose. 

If I were the judge, I might mobilize the police force in the court to enforce the regulation. I might interpret it as contempt of court.

Well, the defendant may have a reason for passive disobdience.

How about my treatment of my son's passive disobedience?

-- fuxi: Citrix: switch between 1^2fullScreen modes
When cursor is in either screen, try 3-finger touchpad swipe-up. You can then choose a window to show on-top in that screen. The selected window could belong to the remote or home computer

On an unrelated note, you can also try 3-finger swipe-down.. will immediately minimize all windows and reveal home computer’s desktop. At this juncture a swipe-up would restore everything.

I expect a lot more of her.

-- new: play`down my superiority
(a good title is hard)
for decades, I tend to practice a slightly excessive form of modesty, /bordering on/ self-degradation. 
Opening example: I have worked my ass off to improve diet and BMI, but when I meet a OC-effective guy, or a humerous/witty guy, I often ignore my BMI advantage and regard him as superior.

If I can recall and name 50 "superiors" [], 95% of them would have some serious inferiority such that I would hesitate to trade places with him.

inferior: Many of them (or their kids) grew up in an incomplete (if not broken) family. Many of them lost a parent fairly early.
inferior: More than half of them are overweight.
inferior: Many of them have more health issues than I have.
inferior: Many of them have non-trivial but hidden issues in mental well-being, including sleep, relationships, stress, aggression
Most of those occupying higher positions have work stress and career risks far more than I have as a contractor.
inferior: Most of those high-flyers don't have my career longevity. This is another "battery" I have built over decades but I tend to dismiss, esp. when I meet some high-flyer who is without this longevity but... superior ?! 
inferior: Most of them have long-term financial concerns like medical + inflation, retirement income.
Some of them have no kids.

For kids and also adults, when we act aggressively, we need to bear in mind the different aggressive actions.

Worst category is physical (and verbal) aggression, including a small push. In Chinese schools, teachers often ask "who was the first kid to hit the other side?"

Similar to physical aggression, if a kid is angry against someone, the kid can refuse to help that someone. Depending on the context, a helping hand is often considered basic courtesy, so a refusal to help is clearly personal and a passive aggression.

Smashing and angry yelling are not in that category. These are displays of indignation, protest. These can also cross a line in the sand and become aggression, but we usually can see the transition. I feel most of the time, smashing and yelling are not aggressive.  I'm not condoing these actions, but it's important to notice the level of damage -- Smashing something expensive is still less damaging than a push or various forms of verbal aggressions.

-- network effect 
Hi Kenneth,
Thanks for your Valuable personal insights! Today I have another hypothesis for your comments.

When Singapore parents look beyond the Singapore universities, presumably 80% look at UK/Au (by that I also include NZ). I think North America is "too far" and perhaps more expensive on average.  However, I see a hidden advantage to the U.S. -- I call it the network effect.

If your chosen college is physically in the middle of the biggest network of opportunities/activities, then by default, you get more access to the biggest network. Universities and high-end employers form such networks, usually aided by geographical proximity.

The 2nd biggest of such networks might be greater China, but the current #1 is North America, home to the highest concentration of world-class universities and employers.
* If my son (not so academic) gets into a 2nd tier college in the US there would be many campus events, seminars, internships, training programs, alumni support, ... that connect him to the "local area network"  and the NorthAmerica "wide area network".
* If my daughter gets into a college in UK/Au, the "wide area network" available to her would be somewhat smaller than the NorthAmerica network.

I believe the EastCoast network and WestCoast network (vis-a-vis UK/Au networks) offer higher value in terms of jobs and learning opportunities. Therefore, they represent hidden advantages to my son relative to my daughter in the scenario depicted.  

I believe the cross-network exchange (of opportunities, fund, talent..) is over-stated, and conversely, proximity still matters. eg: WallSt often hires interns from tristate colleges more than the other 47 states. A lot of the internship positions do not require high talent and therefore do not justify casting a wide net globally hoping to catch the most talented candidates from all over the world.eg: a 2nd-tier college is not well-known across continents, but is easily recognized in the home state. (My degree from NUS is relatively unknown in the U.S. vis-a-vis many 2nd-tier local colleges). Name recognition helps job seeking and applying to further studies.cross-network exchange takes deliberate effort and is costly in money and time, but look at the local network (esp. within a city like Singapore or Boston or Hong Kong) -- Within a local network, people, jobs, gossips, alcohol, games, sex, and drugs... are on free flow, for good or bad. All based on geographical proximity. I have always imagined that "If I were enrolled in a U.S. college in 1994, instead of NUS, given my talent and aspirations, I would have had a good chance of getting into a tech giant or WallSt." Looking back, I am not sure. I was lucky and successful to get into WallSt at age 33. Due to the network effect, WallSt doesn't recruit much from NUS [1], so I almost missed my opportunity to get into WallSt. I think WallSt is suitable for me, possibly the most suitable domain for me. WallSt (i.e. trading industry globally) is selfish, cut-throat, ruthless, but has treated me well, not only in terms of compensation+benefits. So I feel my entire families' comfortable life rests on my WallSt career.

[1] Many WallSt firms including MLP and many investment banks have a Singapore office and do hire from NUS. However, the bar is very high, the positions very few, and mobility within the industry much much lower than in New York. As a result, it is hard for an NUS grad to get into a trading firm, and move within the industry to a more suitable position. In my financial industry career, I had to move several times to find a more suitable position.
