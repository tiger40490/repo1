.. library
From my early 20s till early 30's, probably after NUS, I often felt inferior to the 20-something technopreneurs, the OC-effective young managers, the young MBAs, CFAs/CPAs, the finance professionals, the mainstreet sales/trading professionals in high-value domains like rEstate, insurance, car,, ... 
In SG, the blue-collar engineer has a low status compared to in the U.S. 
I felt like an ugly duckling, esp. in the dating game. None of the role models in the media or in the community was a programmer.

In the library, I would read tech books all day long, and those young men don't need to read that much. They would read business or magazines, even newspapers. They can also learn on youtube, but I find tech learning a bit supercial on youtube.

Some of them read about rEstate or stocks, as they have an early start on personal finance. I could only watch on the sideline.

I think my 5-10 years of self-study was charging my batteries, or building my infrstructure.

technology industry, esp. software dev profession has grown more important, more valuable in the national economies not only in the U.S. but notably in China. 
U.S. tech profession offers excellent market depth, better than many of those professions.

Schopenhauer : "The capacity to be alone is one of the most distinctive marks of a high intellectual being."

Many depend on other people or service providers to keep them /entaintained/ and engaged.

writing, painting, sculpture, music-making, reading, some singing (in my experience) .. is solitary. My long emails are semi-solitary. Social media apps are not.

retirement .. solitude is valuable. Physical self-reliance is probably the foundation.

Stay Connected in bad times like covid19

Many Buddhists advocate detachment, self-reliance and the impermanence of close relationships.

With git blogging, I often switch between two windows -- the gitBash and the MSWE.

If your gitBash is already in a particular folder, you can run q[start . ] to launch MSWE on that folder.

You can also run q[start path/to/a/file] to launch the default application for that file extension.

For kids and also adults, when we act aggressively, we need to bear in mind the different aggressive actions.

Worst category is physical (and verbal) aggression, including a small push. In Chinese schools, teachers often ask "who was the first kid to hit the other side?"

Similar to physical aggression, if a kid is angry against someone, the kid can refuse to help that someone. Depending on the context, a helping hand is often considered basic courtesy, so a refusal to help is clearly personal and a passive aggression.

Smashing and angry yelling are not in that category. These are displays of indignation, protest. These can also cross a line in the sand and become aggression, but we usually can see the transition. I feel most of the time, smashing and yelling are not aggressive.  I'm not condoing these actions, but it's important to notice the level damage -- Smashing something expensive is still less damaging than a push or various forms of verbal aggressions.

-- fuxi: archive/hide threads on wechat/whatsapp
The list of wechat contacts, the list of linkedin contacts are filled with people I seldom NEED to contact. I dare not delete them because I have no other way to recover their contacts!

The high cost -- With wechat (linkedin much better), these people receive too much sunshine simply because they appear on this wechat list. 

1) It's better to remove them from wechat contact if I have other ways to find them, such email or through other friends.
2) For some other contacts, it's better to archive/hide the conversation thread. This feature is similar to Archive on gmail.
3) ^^^^ In the end, my wechat front page should show only 9 worthwhile contacts.

The wechat/whatsapp/linkedin lifestyle is for people whose personal time and priorities fall within their (large) circle of friends. This lifestyle is a very poor match for my needs. 

I do have a need to connect with a small circle of "friends and family". I much prefer 1) meet-up 2) email. Phone call is a distant third choice. Chat is the worst choice for me.

--fuxi or new: G9 SMS to break away from mainstream brainwash
t_breakaway
* My wife always feels I look too thin for my health and appearance. I remind myself "I trust my BMI analysis -- Based on years of self-monitoring, My BMI goal is well-founded. Many in my cohort would probably get better healthy longevity if they adopt similar BIM goals."

Most of the other SMS messages are related to middle-class aspirations

* Many of my peers seem to suggest my family deserves higher BR. I focus on livelihood and believe a BR equal to 80% of local median income is reasonable and adequate. By that standard, many of my peers spend way too much. 
* branded college .. Can I accept if my kids only get into community college or polytechnic? This mainstream brainwash is still hitting me hard 
* home size
* car ownership .. In the U.S., and even in SG, my peers take up car ownership for convenience, not livelihood. 
* career longevity is more important than salary; healthy longevity is more important than financial security

-- new: simplify your life
t_vague
The choices, and temptations in modern life increases distraction and risk of missteps. Therefore, steadfast focus on protecting... really benefits from simplification.

Prioritization also benefits from simplification

thick->thin is one feature of simplification esp. in theoretical learning.

.. diet .. simply focus on delaying and portion-reduction. Use a few tried-n-tested techniques like raw veg
.. exercise .. simply focus on 5 times a week. fancy equipment not needed. Variety can be good, but I don't want to depend on it.
.. top schools? simply say no.
.. career planning .. focus on dev-till-70. Not so simple but I have managed to simplify a bit.
.. eq investing .. simply focus on current income
.. smartphone addiction .. base camp is a simple concept.
