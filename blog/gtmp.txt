-- new killer talent, or update bpost on personal adv
More than once I imagine that an individual is really mediocre except in one thing, and he/she makes a comfortable living possibly supporting his/her family. By mediore I mean this person is below average on many thins and barely above average on other things.

For this model to be relevant to me, I have to exclude celebrities.

Leaders [most managers] are by definition multi-talented.

I'm good at JIV, but it is simplistic (and unfair) to say I'm barely above average in my studies, wellness, pff, marriage, bonding with my kids,,

-- new: weekend office trip=worthwhile even if no work done
even if I don't actually work for more than 2 minutes on a weekend trip to office, it is still a good habit, because the trip creates the oppportunity to work.

Parents often buy gears to create the opportunity for their kids to discover a personal interest.

I told many friends that I often go to stadium without a target of how much workout I must complete. Instead, I go there to create the opportunity for myself.

Beside work, 
* I get better diet control in office
* I get superior blogg infrastrictire
* I could work out in office or outside
* I could call beijing more easily

-- new: scientific claim: TCM, yoga 
Science ... disprovable
I always believed TCM is proven over centuries but how about lianhua qingwen? 
It is probably proven effective at treating symptoms but there is a different acid test on the effectiveness at treating covid infection.

yoga has proven benefits but how it helps me is very hard to prove.

The meditation part is even harder to prove.
-- update multiple bposts [ctbz? tiny Lifestyle 升?]
My lotus@mrt practice is improving.
I now sit on a plastic bag, so my pants are well-protected and my worry and suspicion about invisible dirt is significantly reduced.

I stitched my pockets to be handphone-friendly

-- fuxi (too vague to become a bpost): I have adapted to my living environment
No longer dependent on library
no longer dependent on stadium
Compared to 2018, I have increased yoga self-practice
I can now jog in many simple shoes, or barefoot
I can now use stairs, lunges, skip rope
I now use more of thin bar, yoga block, exercise mat
-- fuxi or update: for the tiny laptop, touch-screen is less valuable
usage is usually short-duration (below 1 hour 90% of the time).

However, when using the tiny laptop in office, the touch-screen convenience might help me avoid sending emails out of MLP

-- fuxi (no good bpost name): 2nd big problem
Imagine you have been struggling against a serious personal disadvantage in a new place, you then notice another personal disadvantage. It would look worse than it actually is. Your self-esteem (self-image) is already compromised and vulnerable before this second blow.

A few powerful examples:

eg: when I first came to SG. I struggled with English. Then I notice my age is older than my classmates.
eg: when I first came to U.S. I struggled with "status" and (mostly tech) interview. Then I notice my wife's lack of education and English skills.
eg: When Satya (MSFT CEO) and wife had their first child with a problem, he took it in his stride. Then his second child also needed a lot of help, as he said in an interview.
