-- not too fatty like visible fat, or deep-fried, 
-- not too filling like Starchy, thick cream,,,
Seafood is generally lighter and easier to digest

-- trySomethingUnfamiliar
This one has mixed success rate. 

-- raw veg .. I tend to eat lots of raw veg in my everday diet, so in an expensive dish featuring raw veg I don't want to pay for them. 

Unlike cooked veg which often adds unique flavor, raw veg could never really enrich the other things, definitely not in my taste. 

I have learned to enjoy raw veg as bland (often flavorless), light, simple, clean, protective, life-enhancing,,, foods, nothing more nothing less, even when mixed with something (anything) fancy.

-- desserts at fine dining tend to be tiny and shocking expensive. You pay for the preparation and subtle differentiation. These unfamiliar and fancy desserts have never surpassed my old favorites which never exceed $10.

I bend over backward to avoid plastic bottles in the hotel even though they provide it free
I bend over backward to avoid discarding foods, esp. expensive foods

-- update bpost on bachelor's life
Throughout 2018-19, and a few times during 2020-2022, I frequently mentioned my carefree ezlife to grandpa and various friends. What's special about those periods?

One explanation is the percentage of stressful days in a month.
Living as a bachelor, I have fewer demanding/challenging issues like parenting, renovation, grandparent visits,,, and I have more control over my personal time, diet,,,,
