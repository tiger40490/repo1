Hi Liu Shuo,

Hope your family is coping well with covid19. The hand-washing habit reminds me of a past conversation, i.e. our last meal together, in a restaurant near your beautiful North Carolina home. Nice meal, not Chinese but some special cuisin (Greek?). A few months later, over a phone call you revealed several observations of my "unusual habits". 
One was my habit of leaving my seat and washing my hands before the meal. 
You instructed me to imagine a team lunch where everyone including the boss has sat down. I said I would still follow my habit. 
(In recent years, I have followed this same habit in many team lunches at many companies.)

I remember asking you what to do given that I have a history of food poisoning due to missed hand-wash. I think you described it as a personal chocie -- choosing to prioritize hand hygiene, I may inadvertantly create negative impressions among coworkers, opnions that might affect my future in the company.

I said I didn't care much about such impressions and opinions. Even if I stop my personal habit, over several months of interaction, such opinions would form.

We all form opinions about coworkers. Some opinions are more directly related to work -- quality, efficiency, integrity.... Other opinions are so subtle that sometimes I am ignorant or unconcerned about them.

By choice or by chance, I have not moved up in any team, but am satisfied with my situation and job prospect. Therefore, even though I'm ignorant or unconcerned about many opinions, I don't feel I'm paying a price. In contrast, I have paid big prices for some real mistakes.

Some habits create long-term or deeper damage, but my habit is not that damaging. In saying this, I try to avoid downplaying the damage. I try to put things into perspective.

relying on free commercial software service can sometimes be unsustainable -- wechat, whatsapp
In contrast, gmail/yahoomail is reliable

--fuxi: due to PSLE, compulsory WFH
now is the time that I need 
* reap the plowback;  spend political capital
* use rainy day reserve
* ctbz (寸土必争) in such spending

HP laptop
powerline networking

--fuxi: reasons why the long PCN bike trip was challenging
1) scotching sunlight
*) MRT, buses were considered coronaviris-risky
*) parts of the terrain were unfamiliar and tough
*) no placce to sit down for refreshment
*) boy was wearing dark, without sunblock
*) constantly worried about bringing coronavirus to home
