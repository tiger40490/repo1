-- fuxi or new: trust in the gov system: Sgp^Chn
SAFE has a published policy that allows each banking customer in China to withdraw up to Rmb 100k/Y from overseas ATMs.

If you withdraw R99,950 and incur R1100 fees, then do you exceed the quota?

I believe answer is No. Should be completely legit. If a Singapore system finds fault in me, I can dispute or appeal.

However, with China system, it depends. Most mainland Chinese people dare not challenge the system. It might take a lot of legwork.

Like bacteria, a virus has a physical shape, and dimension, but its "life" is an abstract concept. 

A virus has no life by itself, but exists inside a host cell. 
The closest analogy I can think of is a fertilized egg, which may develop into a fetus but is not a human yet.

academic coaching .. requires lots of absorbency, patience
household chores .. requires absorbency and physical effort 
Affliate Marketing Program .. require s absorbency
seeking (and following) counsellor help .. requires absorbency. "Following" is classic zqbx self-improvement.

when I first came to Sg or the U.S. I felt inferior to the earlier Chinese immigrants, who are far more fluent in English.

Now I'm the "early immigrant"

-- fuxi or new: restaurant side dishes 
In most restaurants and in most side dishes [appetizer, dessert,,,], portion size is below half the portion size of a main dish, but price is usually above 70% of a standard main dish. Clearly lower value for money.

Desserts are even smaller than side dishes. 

I wonder why this high cost. I think restaurant cost is not so much on the raw material. Cost of 2x portion of a side dish is perhaps 3% higher. In contrast, main cost is probably labor cost including taking order, explaining, wash-up.
