-- new: my prejudie: China's innovation
I have a growing prejudice that China is a immitator, follower not an innovator as Americans and Europeans are.

Japan is the first Asian country to open up and reform to adopt western systems ...

拿来主义

The west also picked up many things from India, East Asian cultures...

A country too arrogant to 放下身段 and adopt other cultures will pay a price and decline.

Math (and comp science to some extent) .. China didn't invent any, but China students have very strong foundations.

-- new: hear both sides@story, or get brainwashed
Our judgement of morality, character... etc is subject to brainwash.
* eg: my son's opinion of CCP
* eg: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Catch_a_Predator
* eg: https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=6980&action=edit

We need to read the criticisms, counter arguments, both sides of the story.

Why NYU has so many alumni on WallSt, even though not a top 20 college?
Why HK has so many "top financial professionals" out of a tiny population?
Why U.S. produces most of the top basketball players, out of 4% of world population?

Answer: contexx or opportunity to develop talents.

Sg gov pick upstream domains like financial, life science, digital tech, and bring in multinationals who provide the skill-upgrading contexx to Singaporeans.

I don't want to waste my (reusable) frames even though Cigna pays everything. It's a waste of resources, and also indirectly raises premium.

-- update bpost on glamourous women
Emily Chang was one of the most attractive women in the world -- young, bright, bold, an Asian female (and gorgeous) face in male-dominated Silicon Valley... a breath of fresh air.

Then her youthful face grew old. 
I feel more than 60% of the audience is male, and males are attracted by a youthful, pretty face.

I guess a mainstream, competitive global media power house that's the flagship of Bloomberg's entire technology franchise can't have a 40-something women as the figurehead.

-- fuxi ... or update some post on carefree
Since Sep/Oct I feel my carefree ezlife is diminishing/declining/// in some strange way. It takes effort to explain it

The DIYHI created lots of conflicts, self-blame, zsms about tcost, involution.

Then kids' math exam results ..

In the grand scheme of things, these pains/unhappy episodes would pass.
The "carefree" felt so short-lived, but hopefully, it soon returned.
