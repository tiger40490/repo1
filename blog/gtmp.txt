-- update counter pessimism
This month might be one of the best times in recent months

* meimei math daily drill with daddy
* income is higher than ever
* grand parents finally moving into luxury DJDJ
* my projects are challenging yet doable, with reasonble timelines
* intimacy .. still excellent even after CAD
* pull-up.. still going strong

-- fuxi: the fact that I'm trying to find time to clear backlog in git-blogg and emails ... is a telltale sign of stable stress.
Nothing accute
No skin issue
No parenting anxiety
relatively stable job, unlike Frank.Fu during his final year, or Ash.S unhappy about his job

-- fuxi or new: [24] comparing to the last two quant3sg jobs
In 2023 and 2024, I often feel a spike/surge in work stress, but it is actually lighter than Qz+Macq.

The proportion of challenging, stressful projects was higher, perhaps due to my "prime" age. 
I was bending over backward more in Qz+Mqcq.
I still work weekends, but now I can make slightly more meaningful progress.
In Qz, I constantly felt incompetent. I had a short window for ramp-up.

How about "How fast you figure things out rel to coworkers"? Qz was stressful. Now is moderate.

Aging is a kind of background heat, or perhaps the growing elephant in the room.
Qz+Macq were supposed to be (later phase of) my "prime years" as a finDev.. high expectations from managers (also self-expectations... crushing weight.
In Qz+Macq, I felt inferior to many individuals in my age group, including ex-colleagues/classmates. 
Now I feel progressively relieved of that /baggage/.

In GS and Macq, I was initially given leadership roles... Demanding, challenging. WStC and now is better.

My WStC career plan has strengthened significantly since Macq. WStC is a viable and valualbe option, and exclusive opportunity to me, even though I need to consider CAD, grandma, and other family members.

My commute and (esp.) flexible hours are now better.
I often take time off without using my annual leave.

A big (often-overlooked) factor is the Qz job smell -- proprietary, dead-end, insufficient documentation... struggle

Paradoxically, salary has never become a big factor in my /stressor profile/. Medical benefits.. ditto. In OC I had my lowest salary but good brbr, as always.
Lower salary in Qz+Macq didn't translate to job security :(

~~ How about stressors outside office? Half-ranked by "note-worthy and specific"
My weekly workout routine has proven sustainable for 2Y(?). On this front, am pulling ahead of my cohort.
My sister has become a pillar of strength.
My marriage has proven stable and _resilient_ 
my kids have proven competent, smart (not left-behind). They are growing up healthy in every way. 
My ptf has grown perhaps by millions (in RMB), despite some small write-offs. I have learned to allocate more to SP500.
My CPF plan for retirement has strengthened. My retirement burn rate has remained stable, despite inflation. 
I have uncovered some hidden but critical health conditions. I have uncovered them early, and become more informed of a few related key risks. Am in a better position to protect my heart and other organs
I have made steady progress and completed UChicago program. No measurable ROI but many intangible benefits.

-- update bpost on 看家本领
* caring heart for my kids and my wife, even when I'm under work pressure . Not every man has it.
* conserver lifestyle burn-rate control. For these few years I'm blessed with windfall in salary + pre-inheritance but I know it will end someday so I stay converver
* healthy lifestyle .. successZ
* GTD tech skills for the last 2-4Y, including my "camp out" habit.
** JIV competence .. not directly tested over the past 4Y, but I still think it is more important than OTJ competence.

My rmSelf often remembers the covid years (till 2022?) as my best years in terms of wellness, work stress, job (not "career") security,,,
But in reality the xpSelf experienced quakes in multiple tectonic plates
* RJO months in mid 2020
* Quark project in late 2022
* boy's constipation
* EDyw struggles since Mar 2023 .. multiple devices 
* Sec3 exam fails + suicidal thoughts + conflicts
* aging parents declines .. nursing homes

When I asked Dr Leow about stress and its effect on my heart, he pointed at himself and his nurse and said everyone has stress. The implified assumption is that most stressor come from work responsibilities. (Obviously parenting, pff, self-care also generate stress.)

Why do I want so much to work till 80s? Let's focus on the work stress.
%%A: my dad...
%%A: my mom loved her job as a lecturer
%%A: I saw many old colleagues working into their 70s or 80s, under moderate stress.
%%A: I am convinced that as I transition into the last chapter of my career, work stress would moderate and decline.

-- fuxi: On 28 Feb 2024, Frank.Fu lost his job while I received a huge bonus payout, and immiediately computed my YoY asset growth (annual snap),,, I wonder what are the truly important shields that protect my livelihood high ground relative to the wider population

* in-demand profile on finDev market .. my skills are still relevant, but my age is a growing concern.
* burn rate control .. many have pointed out my strength and my advantage in this particular skill
* cpfLife compared to U.S. SSA payout
* HDB value and rental demand  ... not really dependable but better than other rental incomes
* wellness habits, wellness conditions

some of the weaknesses I overcame with (at least) TWICE the effort 

Chinese compo
Eng listening and oral
driving practice
swimming
cycling
yoga

-- fuxi: temp jobs: 
I tend to perceive temp jobs positively, as learning.

many unlucky job seekers end up working on temp jobs. No job security, low pay, limited trec
eg: Chinese immigrants to Canada
eg: Shuo in 1997 after graduation
eg: my temp jobs in 2005
eg: many of the jobless 2023 graduates from China universities

If you don't worry about livelihood, then you can enroll in a training program instead.

-- fuxi: no_time ~= no_Absorbency
academic coaching .. requires lots of absorbency, patience
household chores .. requires absorbency and physical effort 
Affliate Marketing Program .. require s absorbency
seeking (and following) counsellor help .. requires absorbency. "Following" is classic zqbx self-improvement.
