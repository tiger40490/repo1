-- i have more and more content in 0.txt. what if i misplace the mem card?
For tww questions, use gtmp.txt more?

--fuxi jolt: I'm constantly dissatisfied with my 'burn'
* too little spare time spent on work projects, but for decades I have prioritized tech xx over GTD
* BMI not improving, but I am rather successful keeping starch intake low, delaying big meals, smoothie, raw veg, chia etc

but i tend to brush aside my jogging, the high number of hours in office, my improving attitude on boy, revived mtv for coding drill

--fuxi:
how do I practice some driving to prevent forgetting
Can I practice in China?

--new: carefree=plenty@t$
Mostly carefree depends on BRBR, but a second factor is a buffer of spare time

Long commute eats into this buffer.

Noisy home also eats into this buffer because the most precious time is private time.

--new jolt low-energy on work projects
t_intro
I now feel low-energy (low-absorbency is a second descriptor) on work projects. However, at the same time I could feel high-absorbency on workout (or diet), QQ (or coding drill), parenting,,,

These other absorbency domains are arguably more strategic, so the current situation as described is actually better than the "average" situation which features no absorbency on any front whatsoever.

Is it possible to have high-absorbency on all fronts? Unlikely. Therefore, recognize your priorities, embrace the imperfect self, and celebrate the improved-imperfection. Everyday is imperfect anyway.

--fuxi: importance: refresh imt learnNew
One key reason why I spend so much time on blog review compared to reading books -- memory limitation

For the same reason, my ratio of [ time on tech knowledge refresh / time on learning new ] is one of the highest among my peers

--fuxi: parachute and similar imageries

safety nets .. are set up Around a workplace
cushioned outfit .. as in CZ12 the Jacky Chan movie. You can wear it at all times.
rescue helicopter .. on demand

--fuxi jolt: I blame meimei when I had to undo a few hours of installing of the latch, but
most of those hours were learning. Next installation would be much faster.

--fuxi: consider buying a smartphone where I have full control on what apps I can uninstall. 
youtube etc are harmful to my kids, to their habits, to their eyesight...

The benefit of wechat, whatsapp etc need to be weighed against the harmful effects.

--fuxi: I explained to e-power shop boss for a long time ... long-winded
However, this is better than missing some valuable points. These secondary points I make are often important in hind sight.

By repeating myself many times, I usually come up with new content, new pointers. When I run out of fresh content, I would automatically stop.

--fuxi: Aspire keyboard repair is t-efficient as buying-new would cost many hours.

--fuxi: Vivo sms notification: swipe down then tap

--shall I replace the water spray pipe preemptively?
The risk of flooding is too high
--ask wife and kids to help make 6 color hats
One of them is probably least used. If I actually wear it I may be nudged to think in that direction.

The windowsUpdate problem is AA) recurring BB) without simple and reliable solution CC) irritating to ME 

The only solution I found so far is landGrab. I felt silly to spend hours setting up the tools to support landGrab. zsms! The zsms is annoying to say the least.

I feel CSY's view on coding practice is similar in that he probably feels silly to spend months on it, but he just couldn't find any better solution to this huge and immediate problem. 

In contrast, Deepak has a positive attitude. Some may say that over 3 years, Deepak won't improve to get ahead of CSY, but who are we to judge. Life is full of surprises. Deepak will improve as long as he keeps up the practice, and someday he will get lucky.

Actually, my windowsUpdate situation is better than CSY's situation, becasue I have a working solution.

--fuxi: in old age, grandparents would deal with lack of family support partly because of an earlier chocie -- decades ago they encouraged their children to go overseas.

This is a big sacrifice made by thousands of families in China.

For the last 50 years in China, each family member chooses the city to stay, largely based on livelihood reasons. My wife and I would probably choose the U.S. or SG. My sister chose Australia. Grandparents choose Beijing.

This level of individual freedom comes at a price -- physical separation of family. 

(t_ffreelimitation) If physical contact is important to you, and if you can afford it, you would want to fly (business class) more often, take more leaves, or take lower-paying jobs to live close to grandparents.

--fuxi: when grandpa is gone then grandma would not be used to the solitude. I think she would want to live with me and my kids

--fuxi: to give more support to grandparents
both are becoming my dependents. 

identify the cycle of ineffective handling of challenges. 

Sugg: make time and create mental energy reserve by reducing the fixation on boy.
