-- 爷爷托梦
“我尽力了”
Q: 你有尽力多活几个月吗？
“最后这一年，晚上都睡不着， 早上起来全身没劲。 吃饭没有味道， （这里的食物没你妈做得好）。 生活没有乐趣。 走路也走不动。”

“不痛苦” 
Q: 你没害怕吗失去生命的那一刻吗？
“我是勇敢的， 抗美援朝的时候，战友这么说"

Q: 上次来看你那次，一月初，你记得临走我对你说的最后一句话吗？
“你叫我夜里不要起身自己上厕所， 要我按铃”

"好孩子。你是孝顺的孩子。”

孙子： “我相信TYX， 会有出息.” 
“TYX 将来是个有出息地孩子”

“你妈是他们的师母，名副其实”
“你妈有时候脾气不大好， 但是对我的照顾，几十年，无微不至。 靠她，我才活到最后这一天。 照顾我她很辛苦。 你作为儿子， 有义务赡养你母亲。 这是我的心愿， 也是我对你的要求。 我知道， 你姐姐和你， 不会扔下你妈妈不管。”

Q: 你有没有遗憾我没见你最后一面？ 
“就算我离世之前你赶到了， 我也看不见你。 前一天晚上， 我睡过去没再睁开眼， 任何人我都看不见。” 

坐厦门航空 MF8118 从北京大兴起飞， 飞机在倾斜地攀升. 正闭目养神， 脑海里竟然浮现出爷爷熟睡离世的面容。 下巴还开着 （戴了几天几夜的呼吸机刚摘下）， 样子怪可怜的。 但无痛苦悲戚， 没有无奈挣扎，也没有想要唉声叹气而又说不出的迹象。 四肢舒展，右膝向外略弯。 更像在做梦。
我心里豁然明朗，爷爷一生可圈可点，没做过坏事，两袖清风。 好人有好报，一定是上了天堂，这个时候在天空中和我相遇，提醒我别忘了他离开人间那一刻的姿态。 他那个独特的样子，只有我注意到。 过了一阵子他下巴放松了，变得更像任何一个沉睡地老头子，反而没有了他的个人风格。
这一次经历似乎是有意安排的。 他去世之后， 我第一次坐飞机升空， 爷爷立刻发给我暗示， 暗示他已经升进了天堂， 暗示我不必挂念他了， 也暗示我别忘了，在离开人世那一刻他独特的面容。

stress due to work (or study) is higher than stress due to parenting because work is a constant effort, with constant benchmark like a whip

Avoid airlines without contact number, such as AirAsia. Absolutely no number published!
hard to contact them in an emergency.

If I have, say, $500k to donate, a very small portion would go to start-up. These business people or technopreneurs are profit-driven and have no time to "support" an old small investor.

Those small charities have a fund raising team to reach out and socialize with old folks.

24 Dec 2024, Kun.Hu:

But have you thought of forming your contracting firm to get the banks' direct contracts without being a further sub-contracted employee of another contracting company?

That will give yourself more freedom and more earnings too. 

You can recruit younger talents to work for the contracting company you can form too.

I like this idea and replied in Jan 2025

In general, it's a good idea to book flights a few months in advance. Otherwise your choice may become limited (a nasty surprise).

If you book too far ahead, then you take on a higher risk of subsequent surprises.

Q: in hindsight, is it a best practice to book flights 10M in advance?

I find it reassuring to mark definite dates on my calendar. It gives assurance and certainty about my availability. That's valuable to grandparents and colleagues.

Mentally, I'm ready to write off the S$400 if something unforeseeable happens.

-- new: trust]gov system: Sgp^Chn #SAFE
SAFE has a published policy that entitles each banking customer in China to withdraw up to Rmb 100k/Y from overseas ATMs.

If you withdraw R99,950 and incur R1100 fees, then do you exceed the quota?

I believe answer is No. Should be completely legit. If a Singapore system finds fault in me, I can dispute or appeal.

However, with China system, it depends. Most mainland Chinese people dare not challenge the system. It might take a lot of legwork. 

In Singapore, the government department always has a hotline if the regulation directly affects individual citizens. The hotlines usually give clear answers to guide my decision (a citizen). If things don't work out as explained, I can raise a complaint (as I did many times). Within weeks they would reach out to me and address my complaint.

In China (and U.S.), the goverment department tends to be understaffed (esp. U.S.), unable to deal with 1.4 billion citizens, let alone foreigners. 

U.S. (and PRC) government hotlines are always hard to get through and often give useless answers. We have to rely on private consultants. Whatever the source of information, if we follow it but it doesn't work, then we face an uphill battle. The government department is unlikely to offer any help. You will have to jump through many, many hoops to get it resolved.

According to DJDJ legal assistance, the SAFE gov hotline is familiar with foreign passport holders taking out inheritance.
