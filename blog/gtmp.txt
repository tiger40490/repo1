-- reflections on PEK stopover
passport: ICBC and HSBC completed quickly
winter clothing from Beijing .. I did /pick up/ some [socks, glove, thermal pants, jacket,,,]

Some of the jobs well done. I am (not only) "lucky" to achieve them . Few people can achieve them. :
* nursing home visit
* stitches x 2
* naps after lunch and at E36
* flossing x 2 during PEK->NY
* stretch .. multiple times
* cleared most of the reading materials as planned
* delayed movies until I felt too sleepy
-- update which bpost ?
On the flight, "Less forgettable" items can still be forgotten and misplaced
* passport
* laptop

-- fuxi bpost on restore
Something to look forward to
* Japan trip, even if boy's results are not great
* decent timing at the next 5.6k
* BMI improvement
* getting BGC title 
* more reunions with grandparents
* more math games with meimei; more cycling trips with boy
