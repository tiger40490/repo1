-- 20 years after graduating, one thing I remember about my NUS performance (relative to other schools) was the 2nd-class honors. I think a big factor is the final year project, or perhaps having two D's automatically disqualifies me from first-class honors.

There's no point analyzing it, since we have no inside knowledge.

In contrast, my UChicago grades are much better -- mostly A's and one or two B's

-- socially awkward
BillGates and Mark Z were described as socially awkward in school.

I was very awkward in primary and secondary schools. Slowly found my confidence in high school.

Humor (and wit) is something I lack in most teams. In Shiyan I had a bit of wit, but not humor.

Watching the Mr.Bean episode "Exam", I recall that most western men strike me as comtemporary and polished. But I beat most of them in studies (bigO), in self-discipline, in wellness, in brbr/FullerWealth, even in analytical writing.

-- What I need now is 'get away from the family', and write down or talk to Myself (more than a counsellor) about my feelings. 
Now I feel the value of the office as sanctury.
I also value the sitting area outside Koufu, without the very cold A/C
I also value the stair-climbing facilities, esp. when raining. 
I also value the spare laptops that I can bring to office, or bring to other harbors (stadium, MRT , Koufu...)

-- new: tanko asked: if healthy longevity is so important to you, what else are you doing beside diet and exercise?
I mentioned strong family bond, peaceful, robust response to adversities such as bonus stigma
Then I mentioned wife's health will be a key factor in my golden years. I might become more dependent on her as I grow older. I will learn to be more independent.

sexual health is another factor for "healthy longevity" though I didn't tell him.

--fuxi: i feel not doing well on a few fronts
work proj, localSys esp. fuxi
QQ refresh, coding drill

wellness

Here's a related, secondary question: 
Q: Which areas need the most sunshine in terms of time and laser energy?

parenting .. blogging and review
iPhone policy with boy. Better to reach agreement
wellness and essential self-care
localSys fuxi and self-learning
work proj? not for the next 2 weeks !

--jolt: If a guy has kids, he often receives special "treatment".
This happens regardless of his financial status

This is a jolt to me, because I feel the rich parents deserve no help.

-- no blog: smartTV box
It has special apps preinstalled to download internet content and play on TV.

The internet content could be youtube.. Probably not a streaming service.

Netflix is another app but requires subscription.

One-time $79 investment and you can watch many movies on your TV unlimited for life. No subscription. 

Unlimted movies will make you feel fed up sooner or later. Unconstrained indulgence would dillute the enjoyment. I'd rather buy a movie ticket each time.

--fuxi
when you see a boxer using only one hand, probably he has a weakness in the other hand, or he is keeping his stronger arm as reserve.

There are many examples of each.
* java vs c++
