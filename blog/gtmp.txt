why the yoga instructors give such tough instructions? Because some students can do it !

In contrast, cardio classes don't make me feel so bad because instructions are reasonable to me, but probably unreasonable to some.

It's tough to tell yourself "If I can't follow the instruction then I just take things easy." The whole point of coming to the class is the team environment.

-- new: places to enhance absorbency 
To enhance absorbency for study, workout etc, I need
* library, MRT or bus interchange .. I have tried this many times
* open green field at dusk like 6 - 7.30. In TPY I can't find such a field. I think the jogging track by Kallang river might work. 

TPY stadium is decent but not exactly that.

part of my current comfortable ezlife is plenty of spare time for blogging. Satisfying, rewarding, but at the cost of tech xx pace.

A related consequence -- as I reduce online blogging, I get a growing backlog in git-blog.
