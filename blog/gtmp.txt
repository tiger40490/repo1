How would you feel if (only) you are forced to take a paycut for 6M?

How would you feel if you work overseas, and for 2 years you (only you) are restricted (by someone in your organization) from returning to home country and seeing your loved ones?

How would you feel if your immigration application (and only yours) is refused 3 times without reason?

How would you feel if your immigration application (and only yours) is delayed by 5 years?

These are extremely unbearable mistreatments, but it becomes completely bearable after you find out this is a common experience shared by millions. Fairness is really the key to harmony.

-- new: CIV hands-down win/loss: unbalanced reactions
today I helped Sachin on Q2 of a python CIV by a crypto shop, where he and another Mr Mysterious couldn't pass all tests. I immediately dismissed my success as my luck rather than skill.

In reality, the test criteria is completely fair and clearly documented, so my code is actually better and and my coding skill (by definition) stronger.

My quick automatic self-dismissal, self-devaluation, self-brush-aside is blatant and completely unbalanced:

* when I win hands-down (about 30% of the head-to-head contests) I always dismiss it.
* when I lose hands-down (about 30% of the head-to-head contests) I label myself with many labels -- poisonous labels.

Perhaps the other team (Alina and her friend) doesn't understand the question. Perhaps the other team didn't design correct. It was not an easy careless mistake since they looked very hard for an explanation.

-- slow-cooking new: 2nd big problem
Imagine you have been struggling against a serious personal disadvantage in a new place, you then notice another personal disadvantage. It would look worse than it is. Your self-esteem (self-image) is already compromised and vulnerable.

eg: when I first came to SG. I struggled with English. Then I notice my age is older than my classmates.
eg: when I first came to U.S. I struggled with "status" and (mostly tech) interview. Then I notice my wife's lack of education and English skills.
