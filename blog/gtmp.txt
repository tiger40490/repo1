-- update blogpost on more/less?
Fact: for some of us, we always feel insufficient allocation to this or that aspects of our life. Ocassionally, we feel some overallocation, too.

Our allocation decision is dynamic, fluid and largely run by System1, therefore never perfect.
I mean Allocation of time, System2 resources [attention, energy, absorbency...]

I feel the need to constantly review our past allocation decisions over short and long histories.

The higher ground I want to push toward is a situation where I find very few items constantly starved/deprived/underserved, and ideally the "starvation" is more evenly spread out to all areas.
On this higher ground, I would remember the success stories of change. The success stories empower me to adjust my allocation strategy, rather than powerless guilt.

-- fuxi: why do I care so much that my long emails are not "well-received"? I told myself that those mails are similar to personal diary. I also told the recipients the same.
Somehow I need to accept it even more wholeheartedly. Remember Wei.Li
