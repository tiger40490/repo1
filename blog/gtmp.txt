The brain doesn’t bother to sort out whether you’re smiling because you’re genuinely joyous, or because you’re just pretending.

==== update finer things in life
~~ %%preference4fine dining
After these considerations in this bpost, I have to ask myself "how much/little value, personally?". Fine dining may give high satisfaction to some individuals, but its value is rather low to me. With $20 I can get excellent dining experience, and fine dining rarely surpass it. There's nothing "exceptional" here. Such a level of experience doesn't exist.

Overall, Cosme experience was no really better than Dos Toros. Both felt like Mexican to me.

A crude but useful analog -- sexual satisfaction. Some people try novel techniques, use fancy products, go to /exotic/ places, or change partners, to elevate their experience. For other people, a 5-minute rutine once a month with the same partner is all they need. They don't experience anything exceptional even if they spend a million dollars to create it.
-- not too fatty like visible fatMeat/mayo/butter, or deep-fried
-- not too filling like Starchy, thick cream,,,
Seafood is generally lighter and easier to digest

Starch is part of 80% of fine-dining dishes. I am learning to enjoy low-starch dishes.

-- trySomethingUnfamiliar .. I need to see the picture. If it doesn't look enticing, then poor chance.
-- desserts at fine dining tend to be tiny and shocking expensive. You pay for the preparation and subtle differentiation. These unfamiliar and fancy desserts have never surpassed my old favorites [cheasecake, brownie,,,] which never exceed $10.  If I benchmark 性价比, then it's an obvious no-no. 

The differentiation has $0 value in my mouth.

-- raw veg .. (including salads) I tend to eat lots of raw veg in my everday diet. In an expensive dish featuring raw veg I don't want to pay for them. 

Unlike cooked veg which often adds unique flavor, raw veg could never really enrich the other "things", definitely not in my taste. 

I have learned to enjoy raw veg as bland (often flavorless), light, simple, clean, protective, life-enhancing,,, foods, nothing more nothing less, even when mixed with something (anything) fancy.

I bend over backward to avoid plastic bottles in the hotel even though they provide it free
I bend over backward to avoid discarding foods, esp. expensive foods

-- update bpost on bachelor's life
Throughout 2018-19, and a few times during 2020-2022, I frequently mentioned my carefree ezlife to grandpa and various friends. What's special about those periods?

One explanation is the percentage of stressful days in a month.
Living as a bachelor, I have fewer demanding/challenging issues like parenting, renovation, grandparent visits,,, and I have more control over my personal time, diet,,,,

-- reflections on PEK stopover
passport: ICBC and HSBC completed quickly
