-- new: dependency@AC ++
I now feel slightly less guilty about my growing dependency on AC.

(Is it bad to switch on/off frequently? No evidence.)

Dependency on AC is very common, so commercial support is widespread.
Dependency on car is ditto, but the commercial support is pricier.

Dependency on wireless connectivity is very common, but you depend on other people most of the time.
Dependency on wpress is uncommon
Dependency on NY/NJ subway is common during peak hours only. Extra dependency on it is uncommon.

reflections on the 92S27 reunion in May 2022

I told grandpa later on "not worthy of my envy: their cars, expensive homes, maids, top schools for their kids". These are often white elephants. This is part of my emerging wisdom as an older thinking person.

I also told grandpa that my skills are in demand, with market depth in a growing sector. 
I want to actively reduce attachment to the EPA comfort zone.

I tend to brush off my advantages in diet, workout, bonding with kids, brbr, cashflow high ground, continuous learning.
Many of my advantages are in successE and successZ.

I told grandma that it's hard to avoid comparing to the past or to peers. 
Some aging individuals are able to avoid that to some extent
-- update bpost on commute
Need to balance 2 priorities (3 would be max)
logistical efficiency .. printed material (without need4writing) is far more efficient than laptop esp. for short trips or with transfers
productivity zsms .. laptop with coding or tech QQ, or tech books 

When is best time for git-blogg? Looks like an unwanted child. Commute is a good choice, even if not the very best.
When is best time for my growing recreational books? In office and home

Imagine you have been struggling against a serious personal disadvantage in a new place, you then notice another personal disadvantage. It would look worse than it actually is. Your self-esteem (self-image) is already compromised and vulnerable before this second blow.

A few powerful examples:

eg: when I first came to SG. I struggled with English. Then I notice my age is older than my classmates.
eg: when I first came to U.S. I struggled with "status" and (mostly tech) interview. Then I notice my wife's lack of education and English skills.
eg: When Satya (MSFT CEO) and wife had their first child with a problem, he took it in his stride. Then his second child also needed a lot of help, as he said in an interview.
