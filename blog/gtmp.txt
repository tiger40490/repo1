--update blogpost on piano or python camp
For python camp, yoga and piano, I tend to compare paying vs self-teach

Why don't I compare paying vs procrastination? This is the more likely picture of real-choices. I need to get real and accept the imprefect self.

I think paying may give me the boost I need in self-confidence.

My dad and my mom don't point at someone like LuNuo or TaoYY and say I am less successful in my pay grade. I think they know, at their age and based on their wisdom, the drawbacks of "brank".  My dad doesn't even comment much about my branded degree or my relatively high income. 

Now as I mellow up slowly, I think parental influence is crucial to my self-esteem, self-acceptance. The same will apply to the next generation.

Reality is, those things (brank, degree, big car etc) are exclub/FOMO/kiasu/vainity objects, often unnecessary, and never an essential elements (like health, family) of a good life.

After the Kranji Wetland trip, at bedtime I told my son that when I chose his now mother as my bride, I was warned that my kids may not grow up to become academic kids. My son commented that he and his sister were not academic right now. I replied "the two of you may improve in secondary school or college, or after college." My son asked "what if I never become successful", without exploring the criteria of "success". 

I gave an illustration as an answer. "Your classmate XXX may end up earning 10k/M vs 2k/M in your case but you still can have a happy life". I asked him to work out 10k is 5 times higher than 2k.

I hope this goes down as a memorable conversation. Weeks before this conversation, I asked my son to think about excellence.

I want him to strive for excellence. He is definitely able to achieve some excellence in some domain, but even if a guy didn't find that domain and didn't achieve excellence, the process of striving and the effort, would define him. I think there are some examples, but these are probably the minority. The majority of guys who strive for excellence would achieve it somewhere. 

Just don't settle for mediocrity.

After I told Grandpa about the bedtime conversation, he delivered a shocking reminder that income should NOT be a criteria for a blessed life (幸福). He said something similar to Raymond's words "What if you earn the typical [1] Singaporean family's income? Can't you live a good life in Singapore?" 

[1] I would use the median as a criteria. If your family income is above the median, then you are better than 50% of the Singapore families.

This gives me another motivation for healthy longevity -- if my son's income is below average, then I want to hang around to help him. 

--new jolt: jeju green-tea chocolate
2019 summer my family was one of thousands of turists at a famous chocolate "museum" on jeju island.

The building, the decor was exquisite. Perhaps so was the chocolate but I only had the leftover bit from my daughter's portion.

There were long queues to buy a chocolate ball for about USD 5.

At such horrible $cost + tcost + ccost, you get a real savory experience, right? Well, not in my case. Greentea always ranks as one of my least favorate chocolate flavors, even though this particular rendition was probably a bit more appealing. 

So I didn't join the queue. 

I guess my kids really enjoyed joining the queue for something supposed to be exciting... They don't know what they really enjoy. 

How about buying a high-floor apartment? High $cost and also access tcost but I don't get anything meaningful.
How about buying a quiet suburb home without public transport connectivity?

--no blog
recently I have become quite critical of my son and me.
* my per finance blogging
* my plowback
* roti
* blogging overspend

Just a few months ago I felt so good about my carefree easy life and my comfortable position among my peers !

Change needed: more burn, more self-pushing 

Need to review the positive efforts "Well done ..."

--no blog: my profession as required when filling up forms

I often prefer one-word answers, but a longer, positive answer could influence my self-image.

--update the blogpost on HF
t_fomo^livelihood
To HF, do I come across as fully satisfied, without pains, except parenting?

1) PIP, bonus, stigma, respect
2) FOLB, exclub peer comparison
3) boy's "performance"

In terms of livelihood, All my top 3 deep, recurring pains above are "superficial" i.e. not real threats to my family livelihood, largely thanks to my interview skills. But IV is the flagship of a fleet of strengths. I should also give credit to
* the dev (not just tech) job market and my decision to stick to it. I have key talents to thrive in it such as low cultural bias
* the WallSt contract market that I discovered and held on to
* lifelong wellness habits
* bedrock of stable marraige. I made the right choice.
* bedrock of SG citizenship providing essential protections. I made the right choice.
* my lifelong earn/save/invest and Fuller wealth strengths

My descriptions above tends to lean towards external locus of control, but in reality my personal factors are more important.

wrong-time and related temptations are tougher for me than saving money.

sdxq-related peer pressure is tougher than saving money on other things. 
I have 36 blogposts on t_sdxq to help myself rationalize and mellow up.

--fuxi: the mattress seller says "you spend a third of your life sleeping" so their expensive mattress is equal in value to 1/3 of your life

Actually, sleep quality depends on many things and the mattress is only 0.1% of them.

The sports shoe seller says your health is more important than wealth, but quality of shoes is really a minor factor compared to motivtion and availability of time

--fuxi jolt: I'm constantly dissatisfied with my 'burn'
* too little spare time spent on work projects, but for decades I have prioritized tech xx over GTD
* BMI not improving, but I am rather successful keeping starch intake low, delaying big meals, smoothie, raw veg, chia etc

but i tend to brush aside my jogging, the high number of hours in office, my improving attitude on boy, revived mtv for coding drill

--fuxi: consider buying a smartphone where I have full control on what apps I can uninstall. 
youtube etc are harmful to my kids, to their habits, to their eyesight...

The benefit of wechat, whatsapp etc need to be weighed against the harmful effects.

--fuxi: I explained to e-power shop boss for a long time ... long-winded
However, this is better than missing some valuable points. These secondary points I make are often important in hind sight.

By repeating myself many times, I usually come up with new content, new pointers. When I run out of fresh content, I would automatically stop.

--fuxi: in old age, grandparents would deal with lack of family support partly because of an earlier chocie -- decades ago they encouraged their children to go overseas.

This is a big sacrifice made by thousands of families in China.

For the last 50 years in China, each family member chooses the city to stay, largely based on livelihood reasons. My wife and I would probably choose the U.S. or SG. My sister chose Australia. Grandparents choose Beijing.

This level of individual freedom comes at a price -- physical separation of family. 

(t_ffreelimitation) If physical contact is important to you, and if you can afford it, you would want to fly (business class) more often, take more leaves, or take lower-paying jobs to live close to grandparents.

--fuxi: when grandpa is gone then grandma would not be used to the solitude. I think she would want to live with me and my kids

Sugg: make time and create mental energy reserve by reducing the fixation on boy.
