-- new specialist foreign talent.. or update post on EP holders
SG has limited natural resources.. must maximize and compete on human capital, but the local population human capital is also limited.

Fin-IT is one HVA [high value-add] sector. Most of the qualified individuals are foreigners including Indians and Chinese. Citizens like me are perhaps 5% of the talent pool.

The HVA sectors often need talents that are lacking in the local population. Therefore, SG needs to import foreign talents to jump start those growth engines, and hope to get more locals trained in those HVA sectors.

Many of my Fin-IT foreign colleagues like SG and want to stay here forever. If one of the foreign talens have kids growing up in SG, government hopes these kids mingle with local kids and become naturalized Singaporeans.

These same individuals often migrate to U.S., Australia, Canada, or return to home countries. Therefore, SG is engaged in a global competition for talents and their genes.

AMB looks so daunting but someday I will find the traction/vision
Re my mail to Edmund, most retail investors have not found any vision.
boy's math coaching... My new vision secret is .. put aside benchmarks and try to increase his intrinsic motivation by 1%. Possibly insignificant, but better than nothing.
muscle-up looks so daunting but remember chin-up 100/D was daunting too

-- slow-cooking new: shame and smear campaign
eg 1: Dick Cheney worried about his gay daughter getting exposed if he were to run for presidency and attract the spot light.
eg 2: Trump attacking Biden's younger son during Debate 1

In many jury-based systems, the lawyers would try smear campaign on the key individual + key witnesses on the opposite side, in an effort to discredit them.

Imagine your loved ones becoming the target. Any unusual habits would be used to bring shame on them.

"astra" theme (free) is recommended. 
if you want precise control (me), then prefer non-template, and classic editor.

-- fuxi: drawing board
No choice elsewhere, as far as we know.
The only choice we know:
* Mala board + Mala markers

How I decided to return it on Sat? 夜长梦多. 
Should have called ikea to ask about marker. We didn't have the foresight to know that some special marker exists for this surface.
On Sat, it was an easy and safe option to carry the board back and refund. Greedy algorithm.
