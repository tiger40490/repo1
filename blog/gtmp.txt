Is reading about parenting (and marriage, inter-personal communications) less likely to make a real difference? Yes, blogging about personal reflections are more introspective, more personal.
-- new: speak slowly when..
when speaking to someone new
when speaking on the phone rather than face to face
when spaking about something sensitive or important
when nervous.
when in front of many people

.. no one speaks too slowly. Most peopel including me speak too fast.

If you have a tendency to stutter, then slow speaking can reduce it. If not eliminated, then slow speaking with stutter is a kind of unique personal style. It's not perfect but it can be disarming and earn you trust.

At GardenByTheBay fitness corner and TPY stadium, I enjoy more absorbency with boring strength training. 

Fort Caning fitness corner is so-so.

In all other fitness corners like downstairs, I feel poor absorbency.

I think key is visibility to the onlookers. 

Some gyms put workout equipments right beside a big window, so gym users are easily visible from the busy street outside. Visibility can serve as a potent motivation.
-- new: longRest->tempRecovery
More than one laptop has shown "longRest->recovery".
I had to power down for many days to get a few hours or longer recovery from a defect.

This pattern has many implications.

Periodically, we had better bring out each laptop to use for a while. This sentence is vague until I point out 1) oxidation and 2) longRest->recovery.

A slighly defective laptop (eg: A299) can be used in place of a new laptop to prolong the latter's shelf life.
-- update: each time I feel lucky cf my peers (same or different age), the trigger is usually 
* comp + benefits
* investment gains
* welfare .. quality healthcare at affordable cost (or free as in Canada)
* low tax .. wealth tax
* low inflation, strong currency
* my edu credentials .. ascent of NUS
* workload
* low stress, low politics
* moat, career longevity
* really nice wellness facilities near office or home

.. Basicaly the successC components. Similarly, each sinking exprience has a trigger event in pff, brank, double-income, academic kids, WCBA,,,

Jolt: There are more important tectonic plates, but they are harder to compare -- wellness, family harmony [marriage], long-living parents, successZ, recreations, engaging job,,,

-- fuxi (no good bpost name): 2nd big problem
Imagine you have been struggling against a serious personal disadvantage in a new place, you then notice another personal disadvantage. It would look worse than it actually is. Your self-esteem (self-image) is already compromised and vulnerable before this second blow.

A few powerful examples:

eg: when I first came to SG. I struggled with English. Then I notice my age is older than my classmates.
eg: when I first came to U.S. I struggled with "status" and (mostly tech) interview. Then I notice my wife's lack of education and English skills.
eg: When Satya (MSFT CEO) and wife had their first child with a problem, he took it in his stride. Then his second child also needed a lot of help, as he said in an interview.
