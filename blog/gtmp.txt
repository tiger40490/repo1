-- update bpost on feel`satisfied more than peers
in the nightmare, I was dismissed once again by Macq. 
I did my best but again was the weakest in the team.

In hind sight, the job requirement was simply too high.

How about AshS in his CTO job? CSDoctor's job? S.Liu's job? YY.Tao's job?

If I were to benchmark myself with so-called peers, try to increase my brank, and join the exclub, I would get derailed, lose my carefree ezlife, take on lots of stress. 
If I try, could I become an architect? Not my strength.
If I try, could I become a lead developer like AshS? Not sure. AshS seems to take on too much.

At my age, I have an implicit self-conviction that most of the higher-paying positions are too stressful, with exorbitant expectation.
What I'm unsure is the salary spread. What additional income is possible? After tax, 100k/Y additional? Not worth it.

I told grandpa that my successE [carefree ezlife + harmony, based on wellness and comfortable livelihood] is rare among my cohort, not because I'm better off than them, but because I don't focus on the wrong goals.

The nightmare scenario is much more severe than CB2022

-- update bubble blogpost
When my bubble ball is rolling on cashflow high ground, it is protected against one type of storm, and one type of blackhole

-- new or fuxi
Q: given the cashflow high ground, how could H.Yi improve their marriage and communication.

Suprisingly, the high ground doesn't provide enough of a buffer of protection against marital risks. The high ground improves risks related to family cashflow, but the high-earning wife is also very independent and doesn't want to play a supporting role to the husband. Not a risk factor in itself, but in some cases, this can indirectly create new risks. Many divorce cases involve two high-income earners.

A: professional couple counselling. This service costs a lot in the U.S.
A: hire a maid to reduce the home-making workload on each parent

Perhaps emmigrate to a lower-income country where systems are less complex and everyday life more convenient.

-- update blogpost on wellbeing (which one?
the concept of wellbeing is very vague and academic. It's a target of research funding in public policy, healthcare, psychology, sociology, economics, organizational behavior.

It's realted to lifetime satisfaction, life chances...

-- new: collective suffering ^ victimized
I need a shorter phrase
How would you feel if you receive no bonus as AVP for many years in a row?

How would you feel if you (alone) experience a pay freeze for 2 years?

How would you feel if you work overseas, and for 2 years you (only you) are restricted (by someone in your organization) from returning to home country and reuniting with loved ones?

How would you feel if your immigration application (and only yours) is refused 3 times without explanation?

How would you feel if your immigration application (and only yours) is delayed by 5 years?

These are extremely unpleasant, almost intolerable mistreatments, but it becomes tolerable when it is a known hardship shared by millions. Fairness is key to harmony.



-- slow-cooking new: 2nd big problem
Imagine you have been struggling against a serious personal disadvantage in a new place, you then notice another personal disadvantage. It would look worse than it is. Your self-esteem (self-image) is already compromised and vulnerable.

eg: when I first came to SG. I struggled with English. Then I notice my age is older than my classmates.
eg: when I first came to U.S. I struggled with "status" and (mostly tech) interview. Then I notice my wife's lack of education and English skills.
