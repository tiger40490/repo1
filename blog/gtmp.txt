-- new: trust]gov system: Sgp^Chn #SAFE
SAFE has a published policy that allows each banking customer in China to withdraw up to Rmb 100k/Y from overseas ATMs.

If you withdraw R99,950 and incur R1100 fees, then do you exceed the quota?

I believe answer is No. Should be completely legit. If a Singapore system finds fault in me, I can dispute or appeal.

However, with China system, it depends. Most mainland Chinese people dare not challenge the system. It might take a lot of legwork. 

In Singapore, the government department always has a hotline if the regulation directly affects individual citizens. The hotline usually give clear answers to guide my decision (a citizen). If things don't work out as explained, I can raise a complaint (as I did many times). Within weeks they would reach out to me and address my complaint.

In China (and U.S.), the goverment department tends to be understaffed (esp. U.S.), unable to deal with 1.4 billion citizens, let alone foreigners. 

U.S. (and PRC) government hotlines are always hard to get through and often give useless answers. We have to rely on private consultants. Whatever the source of information, if we follow it but it doesn't work, then we face an uphill battle. The government department is unlikely to offer any help. You will have to jump through many, many hoops to get it resolved.

According to DJDJ legal assistance, the SAFE gov hotline is familiar with foreign passport holders taking out inheritance.

Like bacteria, a virus has a physical shape, and dimension, but its "life" is an abstract concept. 

A virus has no life by itself, but exists inside a host cell. 
The closest analogy I can think of is a fertilized egg, which may develop into a fetus but is not a human yet.

when I first came to Sg or the U.S. I felt inferior to the earlier Chinese immigrants, who are far more fluent in English.

Now I'm the "early immigrant"

-- fuxi or new: restaurant side dishes 
In most restaurants and in most side dishes [appetizer, dessert,,,], portion size is below half the portion size of a main dish, but price is usually above 70% of a standard main dish. Clearly lower value for money.

Desserts are even smaller than side dishes. 

I wonder why this high cost. I think restaurant cost is not so much on the raw material. Cost of 2x portion of a side dish is perhaps 3% higher. In contrast, main cost is probably labor cost including taking order, explaining, wash-up.
