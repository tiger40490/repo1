slender (secured with wall-screw) table between the two doors of storeroom. Can hold kettle

Microwave (often bulky) is often on a small table top, with no space in front.

A bigger table can be set up in laundry room, next to the partition.

-- what made me feel living the utopia life since 2018
Livelihood?
Plenty of buffer in time and cashflow?
detachment and breakaway from the rat race (lay flat), exclub, FOMO

In 2018, I was visiting my family only once in 3M, but somehow it didn't derail anything

-- slowcooking upate resilience
Sg citizens are often reliant on the state. I guess this is similar to other small nations like Finland, Norway,,,, In contrast, Americans, Mainland Chinese... receive less support from the state. "You are on your own." they were told. Such a message is rare given to SG citizens.

The reliance is evident in many diverse domains.

However, Singaporeans as a whole is a fairly resilient nation, as shown in numerous crises [covid, SARS, 1997AFC...]. We are resilient in spite or because of our reliance on each other. 

Same can be said of a family. Kids rely on parents. Siblings lean on each other. 

I guess a small school, a small company are like small nations -- tight-knit group. A larger company can also provide adequate employee support, esp. in the U.S. but company internal such suppport costs a lot to the employer.

There are individuals who don't need to rely on others. They appear to be resilient in the lone wolf sense, but I don't know how common they are, or how strong they actually are. 
I guess in most cases, resilient people tap on a "support network" rather than act as lone wolves. 

One of the most intimate illustrations is counselling, like sexual issues, phobias, obsessions, addictions, behavior issues. Optimism (in the Lone-wolf sense) is just a word, often a weak and ineffective word by itself. Positive thinking is .. ditto. In half the non-trivial cases, the individual needs guidance and help.

Q: What's special about long commute? Why do I suffer so much while others don't?
A: 49 out of 50 of my peers can tolerate it better than I can, just as in an economy seat on a long flight.

-- update ...
Among many Chinese peers like ML.J, Yang was very playful with the controllers. I just felt uncomfortable playing such a role.

When I reconnected with Li Meiqin sometimes in the early 2000s, my friend the businessman Weifeng.Xiao urged me to disclose her number to him. (WF.X had nothing to lose if he could reach out to Li.) I had to pick up the phone and call Li again.. uncomfortable!
Now, WF.X was very comfortable on the phone, but I was more comfortable writing emails. At that age, I lacked the insight, the self-knowledge to see that personality difference. I felt I must muster up courage (to call people) if I were to amount to anything... wrong judgement.

WF.X also used "distrust" as a threat "If you don't give her number to me, then it shows your distrust". It reminded me of my 1994 airticket group-buy incident when I demanded receipt before making my payment. A deeply embarrassing mistake (I could have asked for it in private.)

2022 economist: wealth gap AND income gap both increased, even in high-growth countries.

I feel many workers are struggling agaisnt rising cost in education, transport, food, utilities, and unable to save. 

I guess that their rising income is not enough to compensate for the rising costs, esp. in discretionary categories like longer and more expensive education, private transport, entertainment, dental/skin care, improved nutrition. These costs didn't exist in their earlier baskets.

UChicago is the #1 university outside the east and west coasts. Here are a few more.
Northwestern
Vanderbilt
Rice

The busienss schools, law schools and medical schools have separate national rankings. UChicago has top-ranked business school and law school, both comparable to Harvard.

CalTech has a ranking advantage that in its strongest domains, there are many nobel prizes, more than in compSci, humanities.

-- slowcooking update bpost on brush-off
reflections on the 92S27 reunion in May 2022

I told grandpa later on "not worth my envy: their cars, expensive homes, maids, top schools for their kids". These are often white elephants.
This is part of my emerging wisdom as an older thinking adult.

I also told grandpa that my skills are in demand, with market depth in a growing sector. 
I want to actively reduce attachment to the EPA comfort zone.

I tend to brush off my advantages in diet, workout, bonding with kids, brbr, cashflow high ground, lifelong learning.
Many of my advantages over these ex-classmates are in successE and successZ.

In whatever that matter to me, I don't feel left behind. I am getting ahead, in stealthy footsteps.

-- update bpost on commute (which one?)
Need to balance 2 priorities (3 would be max)
logistical efficiency .. printed material (without need4writing) is far more efficient than git-blogg esp. for short trips or with transfers
productivity zsms .. laptop with coding or tech QQ, or tech books 

When is best time for git-blogg? Looks like an unwanted child. Commute is a good choice, even if not the very best.
When is best time for my growing recreational books? In office and home

-- new ##a reminder rarely picked up
eg: I put my interdental floss on my desk as a constant reminder. I use it once a few months, but it is still worth it.
eg: I put my grip trainer on my desk as a constant reminder. I use it once a few months, but it is still worth it.
eg: I installed my pull-up bar at home years ago. For years I didn't use it but it was a constant reminder. Now I use it every week
eg: I installed my punchbag at home. Now I use it once a few months, but it's a huge reminder.
eg: company provides standing desk to everyone. Sometimes I use it once a week, but the gap between usage can grow to a few months. Yet it's still worthwhile.
eg: we bought dozens of books from China and positioned them in "prime" locations. Kids pick up one book in a year. Perhaps not worth it
