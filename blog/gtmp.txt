-- new: table lamps: batt/LED : vs bulb
adv: low heat.. important for SG
adv: low energy footprint
adv: power cable required only during charging. See charging tips below.
adv: for clamp lamp, batt model is displacing bulb models. So I better get used to this new model
disadvantage: can't replace bulb. I think battery is less durable than bulb
disadvatnage: less bright even for my table lamp usage.

charging restrictions:
* 24H max charge
* every 3M of disuse, charge 8 hours, perhaps in OFF mode. Protects battery life. I think 100% depletion hurts battery.

charging recommendations:
* better recharge well before battery 100% depleted

--fuxi or new: excessive blogg@@
part of my current comfortable ezlife is plenty of spare time for blogging. Satisfying, rewarding, but at the cost of tech xx pace.

A related consequence -- as I reduce online blogging, I get a growing backlog in git-blog.

-- new: to disable hundreds of win10 services
msconfig.exe lists hundreds of checkboxes.

These could contribute to performance drags.
