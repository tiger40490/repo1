TeamSG progressively moved up the global city ranking on many indicators, and not by luck or historical advantage.
Many countries and cities try to copy Singapore's formula and usually fail to excel.

Similarly, it's no mean achievement of me to avoid falling behind on any race, and to get ahead on a few races.

as my parents age, the free tablespace dwindle. They need to spread out a great deal of stuff over a lot of tablespace, to help them find their stuff.

-- new: livelihood won't fend off these pains
Even without livelihood /issues/, some people (including Family-n-Fiend) can feel real pains due to 
* injustice .. eg: See https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=24197&action=edit
* gross unfair treatment ... eg?
* .. losing a /rewarding/ career for a bitter reason like personality, or unfair dismissal
* failure in love relationships (incl. non-starter)... "Livelihood" doesn't meet this basic need.
* chronic family conflicts .. eg: me vs in-laws; grandparents; sis vs grandpa
* wasted personal potential? If livelihood fine, then the "waste" is tolerable?

Bias of hindsight .. I would say a lot of times the "event" cause livelihood issues "for a while". Could be a few days to a few years. I guess many dismiss the livelihood "stress" in hind sight, but without hindsight the stress feels non-trivial and permanent (like covid19 appeared in 2020).

My parents' home is not kept so clean and tidy. They are too old to take care of it.

Boarding east-bound at Paya Lebar can be crowded. Bugis is slightly better but likely slower. If plenty of time, then CityHall transfer is the most comfortable and convenient.

==== new: ##peaking #
Rarely, a peak is followed by an unexpected peak, but for now I won't focus on this pattern.

Describing peaks is a form of highly subjective self-rating. I want to do it with a positive twist.

Peaks tend to come in waves. Each 3Y window tend to see some peaks. 

Q: what are some (up to 3) recent peaks?
A: joyous intimacy; tech xx absorbency; BMI profile;  

-- diversified investment? 
-- brBufferRatio
-- easy work hours/workload
Covid years are the peak

-- total comp
Probably peaking soon
ditto comp + benefits
annual bonus? Not yet peaking
-- 5/wk workout absorbency? Not yet peaking
-- jogg frequency
-- chin-up

In my 20s and earlier, I used to worry about substance addiction, as if my body can get out of control. 

I think masturbation proved that the biological needs can be overwhelming.

Now I'm nearing 50, I know my body is stable and will not get out of control. Appetite growing out of control remains the last concern.

-- new: final chat with Miles
tech stack is often older in finance than other industries.

Any warning sign before PIP? No java workload for months, but no other explicit performance advice or tip-off.

Did you take up c++ to improve your survival?  Not after Brijesh transferred to London.

I feel Miles might be standing outside and looking through the glass window, as described in https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/47739/2007-adapt-to-us/

-- new: good person: intent^impact
Trigger: Since my 40s, I often explain my "good life" in terms of good karma. I guess karma is about consequences but I feel karma is also about intent.

Both Buddhism and Christianity have tradition of forgiving and accepting ex-criminals, provided they are repentant/remorseful. Clearly, "Impact" is not everything when intention is a factor.

Trigger: Increasingly, I tell my family and beyond (and I believe) that I'm a good person, but by what standard? We judge a person by her impacts on others around her, and her intensions. Kindness is one of the key intensions.

Penal systems in many countries recognize both damage (a form of Impact) and intension. In contrast, most awards focus exclusive on impact.

On judgment day, when you stand before God or Yan2wang2ye2, what things count? Your impacts or your intensions?

Why NYU has so many alumni on WallSt, even though not a top 20 college?
Why U.S. produces most of the top basketball players, out of 4% of world population?
Why such a high concentration of Nobel Econs prizes in UChicago, Harvard and MIT? These universities are the tip of the forefront.
The 5 English speaking countries add up to below 400M population, but why they produce so many global movie stars?

Answer: contexx or opportunity to develop talents.

Sg gov pick upstream domains like financial, life science, digital tech, and bring in multinationals who provide the skill-upgrading contexx to Singaporeans.
