-- update blogpost on more/less?
Fact: for some of us, we always feel insufficient allocation to this or that aspects of our life. Ocassionally, we feel some overallocation, too.

Our allocation decision is dynamic, fluid and largely run by System1, therefore never perfect.
I mean Allocation of time + System2 resources [attention, energy, absorbency...]

I feel the need to constantly review our past allocation decisions over short and long histories.

The higher ground I want to push toward is a situation where I find very few items constantly starved/underserved, and ideally the "starvation" is more evenly spread out to all areas.
On this higher ground, I would remember my success stories of adjustment. The success stories empower me to endeavor to adjust my allocation strategy, rather than powerless guilt.

-- chat with Cigna counsellor 
Most of the resources he sent by email require effort on your own.
All the advice received could be ignored.
Ultimately, the client (me in this case) needs better understanding of the self [priorities, limitations..] and take actions to change his perceptions, his attitude, his explanatory style, his self-talk, his habits, .. 

Therefore, introspective, reflective insight is invaluable. 

I think this counsellor really listened and he repeated his suggestion for the I-statement, including the positive I-statements. These are very direct, rather than vague.

Q: what do you need for self-care?
A: plenty of quiet time and personal space. Wife needs it too. Perhaps I can free her up once a while?
A: blogging on many topics
A: I feel the hunger for more meaningful conversations, with anyone

Q: hypothetically, what would it look like if father-son relationship had improved?
A: more outing trips [shopping, workout,,,]
A: more chats, like the general knowledge chats
A: If I want more physical touch but he doesn't like it, then I want him to explain it in more words. So I can learn and adjust my gestures.

These could contribute to performance drags.

Allocated column is more useful than SIZE column as it is after-Compression

-- fuxi: why do I care so much that my long emails are not "well-received"? I told myself that those mails are similar to personal diary. I also told the recipients the same.
Somehow I need to accept it even more wholeheartedly. Remember Wei.Li
