--I visited swimming pool and couldn't help comparing with my last bachelor phase around age 31, when I developed weekly swimming routine.

i didn't have the nonwork income sources
I didn't have UChicago brand

below $4 table-edge cushion for about half a meter. Need to compare with the wide versino I bought
$1.60 spare goggle for boy
$2.10 roach trap
