--new blogpost:
A central technique through TMP is class template specialization. Class templates' flexibility can only be achieved via specialization but function templates's flexibility can be achieved via overload ! Overload is much simpler and cleaner than specialization.

In [[c++coding standard]], Alexandrescu/Sutter said "Don't specialize func templates"

--Q: in graph DFT and BFT, do we need a "seen" hashtable to remember visited nodes? 
A: I probably needed it in the path count problem
A: 
I think so. The textbook DFT/BFT algos use white/grey/black for this purpose. It's basically a hashtable { node addr -> color }

This color technique is not needed for a simple binary tree, but it can become useful in "medium" CIV?

--New blogpost: many things]python can have attributes 
Those "things" can be a module, a function, a class, an instance of a class

An attribute can be a data item or a method.

I feel attributes are related to namespaces, meta-programming and reflection.

--python features I learned on flight to NY, before Jump IV
* reduce()+lambda for ECT
* __debug__
* attributes
