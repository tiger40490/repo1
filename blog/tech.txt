-- update or new: 2D-array ptr type
If via malloc then we get a int ptr

if declared as static 2D-array, then we get a ptr-to-int-ptr i.e. double ptr
How about a jagged 2D-array? Same double-ptr

how about a shared ptr to a 2D-array? I think it's same as shared_ptr to a 1D array. Note this features is unavailable before c++17. If you pass a heap array to shared_ptr, the shared_ptr dtor will call delete rather than delete[] on the original ptr :(

-- new
In java I was able to GTD for years without knowing a lot. 照猫画虎, 囫囵吞枣
In c/c++ the syntax is tricky and nuanced, so we need to know a bit more.
In most newer languages, we don't need to know a lot. Therefore, the low-level understanding (my competitive strength) has lower market value.

-- new or update: java: big lambdaEx^methodRef
I think a big lambdaEx (lambda expression) is usually [1] used as an argument to a method. 

Q: can we convert the big lambdaEx to a method reference?
A: not alwaysl. In Dropcopy framework, I realized that 

* many times yes I can and should convert. LambdaEx is designed for small code blocks.
* however, if the lambdaEx uses captured variables, then conversion can be difficult. I think the new method has to add a new param for every captured variable.

[1] There might be other usages, but in this blogpost I can put them aside.

Possible, but not popular
Define the __add__(self, other) method

-- fuxi: closest ancestors of c/c++
For c++
#1 is C
#2 is Simula

For C, the #1 is the B language. It explains the naming of "C"
