signals in windows? not popular

real time signals are a new Posix concept... not really low-latency. 
Low latency sockets don't rely on signals for immediate action

Many signals are self-sent from the same process. I think timer alarm is one example. Sockets is another example. However, keyboard signals like Ctrl-C are not self-sent.

Signal is designed to be asynch, seldom immediate, though the scheduler may preempt whatever is running and give the next time slice to the signal's target process sooner than normal.

One of the most common signals is SIGSEGV. The default signal handler function performs a core dump. There's no process to preempt. However, the current process may not check its signal table until some instructions later, and then run the signal handler.
