-- GST IV: some topics 
byte-level parsing. WebAssembly encoding scheme supporting variable length strings... I mentioned protobuf

IPC.. I mentioned flat file (faster than RDBMS); distributedCache; sharedMem. He mentioned local sockets, but presumably less used.

What' the matching engine throughput you achieved? I said 10 TPS with database. Very modest and realistic. Without database I said perhaps 1000.

persistence of order state on the critical path? If async write-behind, then what if you lose power after sending the order, but before persistence? 
I said there's always tradeoff and limits to the ACID guarantee. 
Even with RDBMS level of ACID support, you may still have a need for redundant writes. If you worry about site power failure, then you need UPS. If you worry about bombing, then you need offline backup, which adds even more latency. 
I guess this answer shows my big-picture wisdom.

disaster recovery process in RTS and in EPA

retransmission, gap management. I think most interviewers have no idea of the complexities.

How do you benchmark your app? I gave a fairly detailed desciption of RTS in terms of mem + throughput:)

Why such small memory footprint?

....c++ questions
how is template implemented in c++
nm .. what if nm complains about a missing shared lib, but the file is in your local file system?

..What TMP techniques did you use? I mentioned CRTP. I was frank. I believe if you aren't writing library, then no need to incur the complexity cost of TMP. If I do write a library with complex usage requirements, then I will google to find out when to use which TMP technique.
What's enable_if. I correctly associated it with SFINAE

.. What are the underlying differences between static and shared lib? Suppose a host app uses a SO and a .A library . When .A changes, hostApp must recompile/relink to embed the new .A lib. If SO changes, hostApp may not need to recompile.

How is lib func name resolution performed in the SO case? I admitted ignorance. I think there must be an offset for each function in the SO. HostApp binary saves the offset? Is SO runtime cost higher?

--new: gap mgmt in FIX^RTS
Multicast is lossy. Very easy to notice a gap. Receivers like RTS should not immediately request retransmission. Instead, they should exercise discretion and implement 

FIX models a huge file. Any gap in seq# is unacceptable, and must be addressed before processing any unexpected high seq#.

Proposition 1: Dinosaur existed
Proposition 2: speed kills or "Children lie"

Not P1 AND Not P2 means (Not P1) and (Not P2), with or without the parentheses.

Same in any language.

in GMDS, catcha mail .. a greenfield design needs to focus on the show-stopper aspects like crashing, instrumentation.

latency is not really a practical focus.

-- fuxi: These new "infrastructure" technologies are not reliable and fooolproof as traditional infrastructure technologies.
eg(big): wordpress block editor
eg: show-stopper: oversensitive touchpad 
eg: show-stopper: home wifi issues
eg: github new policies
eg: wechat issues
eg: wordpress take-down notice
eg: windows license expiry
eg: windows update kick-in at the wrong time
eg: Citrix issues
eg: M1 and starhub blackout

-- fuxi: java 5 and java 8 are the two releases most quizzed in interviews.
How about java6/7/9? They introduce rather few visible changes. 

In fact, beside generics, java5's other changes are hardly visible. There are many additions in concurrency library but invisible/irrelevant to most developers.

signals in windows?

real time signals are a new Posix concept... not really low-latency.

Most signals are self-sent from the same process. I think timer alarm is one. Sockets is another example. However, keyboard signals like Ctrl-C are not self-sent.

--fuxi: sys call is not always hardware related. my linux book has a section on sys calls related to signals!

Now I realize BFT is by level i.e. visit order is root to leaf. DFT is bottom-up

--new untitled
95G offer service used tibrv to send updates to GUI. Robust and fast. 
(MLP also uses messages to update GUI)

--fuxi:
Citrix became very slow when I moved to a location far from the wifi hotspot. I could see the signal strength dropping very low.

--fuxi: JVM remote debugging is not so foolproof.
GDB is not so foolproof. See my blogposts.

We need to fully embrace the reality that live debugging is often impractical.

In contrast, "echo" is the gold standard in code tracing.

--fuxi: 5GHz ^ 2.4GHz wifi
Range favors lower frequency. Bigger homes may need it.

bandwidth favors higher frequency. Video streaming.

Overcrowding in 2.4 can cause intermittent connectivity issues, but is it 5% of the time or 0.05% of the time? Not sure. Microwave did hit me.

--new: malloc != syscall
is malloc a kernel service, syscall or a userland function offered in a regular library?

Can I implement my own DAM without involving the kernel? I would say some kernel sys call is needed.

Is there a cpu instruction for heap allocation? Does cpu care about heap vs stack? Yes the CPU cares about the stack.
whilst the stack data is managed via the CPU, the heap is not managed automatically. The size of the heap can also be considerably larger than the stack and the allocation of memory must be performed manually within a program. Memory also has to be freed manually, again unlike the stack.

Can check my linux book or google on brk()

-- new or fuxi: set in python
set is the least used builtin container. I seldom use it, becasue dictionary is more useful.
( Similarly, list is always more useful than tuple, except when used as dict keys. )

One advantage of set over dict or list -- set-comprehension to create a hashset

My Questions
Q: for low latency should we avoid concurrency ?
A: yes
%%A: parallel processing in ST-Mode is good but avoid any form of synchronization 

Q: If I don’t use heap, and only use stack and static memory….?
A: heap allows sharing between threads

Q: why is JIT not available to c++?
%%A: c was not designed for JIT and ineffective
