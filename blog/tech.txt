--When setting up a new phone (laptop, and outlook are similar), i need to simplify it.
disable many notifications
uninstall many apps
remove all the unsolicited content pushed to me like on maps and social apps

ergonomics, comfort

The more I rely on a device (laptop, linux, printer/scanner, camera..) the more I need to (invest time and) analyze my priorities and preferences.

--new: std::bitset: popular ] WallSt c++coding IV
std::bitset is popular in WallSt c++ coding interviews. Rather easy to use if you are an experienced c++ developer.

to_string() and cvctor from string like like "011100101011010"
to_ulong() and cvctor from ulong
operator[] returns a reference, so you can assign to myBitset[0]. Designed to mimic a raw array on the surface. Actually, return type is not reference to a bool. Rather, I think it's a reference to a specific posiiton in the "backing store". See http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/bitset/bitset/operator[]/

Lowest bit has position 0, becasue bitset is designed to represent a binary integer. To scan from highest bit, we must iterate from bitset[size()-1] to bitset[0].

When an order is sent directly to NYSE, NYSE could decide to route it to BATS-Y which fills it. I guess the fill report should probably show 30=BATY

liquidity indicator might show 3 (routed out)

--new: iphone explosure due to overcharge overnight
apple hotline told me that there is builtin protection for overheating.

If it's a genuine iphone without damage or tamper, then it won't explode. If it does, it's a defect. What we see on video footage could be fake. 

Before a phone explodes due to overcharge, there would be signs of unusual heating.

--new:
Half of the major new language features are designed for the std library developers.
The unspoken assumption -- these features are equally useful to other library developers.

The follow-up assumption -- app developers also need to use some (and understand all) of the nitty-gritty details.

In reality, not relevant to GTD for app developers.
--new: price discovery and closing auction
An exchange provides the (nearly) ideal venue for price discovery, but in reality the fragmentation of liquidity makes price discovery non-trivial even on a large exchange like NYSE.

Luckily, the closing auction remains a centralized process. Even though a stock symbol can be traded on multiple exchanges beside the primary listing exchange, auction orders are always sent to the primary listing exchange.

sched_setaffinity is a syscall!
all other *affinity* functions are based thereon

*_np in function name means non-portable

Need to read more. Similar to socket QQ -- Not deep, but even more academic than socket

is malloc a kernel service, syscall or a userland function offered in a regular library?

Can I implement my own DAM without involving the kernel?

--Martin's low-latency java talk
Deallocation is worse than allocation. Deallocation may use locking if performed across threads.

My Questions
Q: for low latency should we avoid concurrency ?
A: yes
%%A: parallel processing in ST-Mode is good but avoid any form of synchronization 

Q: If I don’t use heap, and only use stack and static memory….?
A: heap allows sharing between threads

Q: why is JIT not available to c++?

--pointer as a field of a class is uninitialized by default
I think Ashish's test shows it

However, such a field creates an opportunity for mv-ctor. The referent object is usually on heap on in static memory

--new: Q: why unlike java/c#, in my c++ jobs I seldom needed to learn ide? 
(I used msvs only for automated build since windows command line build is based on msvs.)

in my java jobs, i often need to spend lots of time learning the ide features.

A: c++ IDE is less effective less value-adding more complicated. Majority of c++ developers actually don't use any IDE. 

--new: 
one of the most obvious and real limitation/obsolete features of c++ as a language is the tool chain.
Part of the ecosystem
Too complicated compared to newer languages like java. The dynamic scripting languages are even simpler

Also an entry barrier. Young people can take it up if determined, but majority of them are put off. 

There's a minimum mileage required. Many young people don't stay on it long enough. 

My vi mileage is also too short.

In my early days using c++, I tried to set up eclipse CDT and spent lots of time on the tool chain. My goal was to set up similar convenience ... Futile. Not worthwhile. java tools are much better. Most c++ programmers don't bother with such convenience and rely on command line tools.

Similarly, yoga is hard for most people but some individuals are determined and can overcome the initial hump (6-24M) and find joy and reward

--new: low latency: avoid dynamic data structures
RTS uses no STL containers.

In my first programing job, I used C without malloc, because I used only array + struct. If my collection were to grow, then I would have needed DAM. 

I feel low latency generally avoid mid-day DAM. If DAM required, then pre-allocation is preferred.

--GS-HK interviewer said with an array-based order book he could achieve 1 million updates per second.

This is in response to my claim that Rebus is 700K MPS.

Martin Thompson basically said if the performance is good enough for the requirement, then no need to go further.
