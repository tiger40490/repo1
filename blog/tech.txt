--new blogpost:
A central technique through TMP is class template specialization. Class templates' flexibility can only be achieved via specialization but function templates's flexibility can be achieved via overload ! Overload is much simpler and cleaner than specialization.

In [[c++coding standard]], Alexandrescu/Sutter said "Don't specialize func templates"

--Q: in graph DFT and BFT, do we need a "seen" hashtable to remember visited nodes?
I think so. The textbook DFT/BFT algos use white/grey/black for this purpose. It's basically a hashtable { node addr -> color }

--New blogpost: many things]python can have attributes 
Those "things" can be a module, a function, a class, an instance of a class

An attribute can be a data item or a method.

I feel attributes are related to namespaces, meta-programming and reflection.
