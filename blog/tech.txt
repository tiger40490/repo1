--vtable contains
offset of base type subobject. In multiple inheritance, this offset is often non-zero. This offset is needed not only for field access but also casting 
typeid

These details are part of the compiler ABI, since object files from older and newer compilers would link together.
Best-known part of ABI is name-mangling algorithm.

every problem asking "top N" -- quick-select gives average linear time. Real upper bound is O(NN)
every problem hinting O(1) space -- no auxDS. Use array-swap. Or save (2D) array indices in the array as payload
every problem hinting O(N) -- use hash table, linked list, append on BST/priorityQ, deque

Runtime heap allocation is slower if the record is bigger. In contrast, the global dictionary is tiny and likely lives in L1-cache
