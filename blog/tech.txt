-- update kwargs
q[ *mylist ] reads like 'flatten mylist'

This expression can be RHS or LHS

-- new: deepcopy
copy.deepcopy() is never quizzed, but is a key ECT feature in CIV. It's fairly easy to use, and seldom requires any tweaking/troubleshooting.

Once a while, we can showcase our python expertise by drawing attention to deepcopy. It solves two common problems of object graph cloning, using a memo object.

Deepcopy is somewhat related to serializer "pickle" module.

Your class can implement def __deepcopy__(self, memo). In it, you can deep clone a component2 using deepcopy(component2, memo).

Standard module doc is concise and readable.

-- new or update on signal+socket
signals in windows? not popular

real time signals are a new Posix concept... not really low-latency. 
Low latency sockets don't rely on signals for immediate action

Many signals are self-sent from the same process. I think timer alarm is one example. Sockets is another example. However, keyboard signals like Ctrl-C are not self-sent.

Signal is designed to be asynch, seldom immediate, though the scheduler may preempt whatever is running and give the next time slice to the signal's target process sooner than normal.

One of the most common signals is SIGSEGV. The default signal handler function performs a core dump. There's no process to preempt. However, the current process may not check its signal table until some instructions later, and then run the signal handler.

-- fuxi: operator overloading for a python custom class
Possible, but not popular
Define __add__(self, other) method

The pattern extends to non-operators:
Define __deepcopy__(self, memo) method

-- fuxi: closest ancestors of c/c++
For c++
#1 is C
#2 is Simula

For C, the #1 is the B language. It explains the naming of "C"

-- new: a few minor criticisms of c++
An obscure but simple shortcoming of c++ lies in the iostream. There is a shared mutable global state in the global variables cout (and cerr). Every call to setXXX would permanently update the global state until updated again.

iterator invalidation .. a common gotcha

private methods are exposed in class header files.
