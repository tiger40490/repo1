signals in windows? not popular

real time signals are a new Posix concept... not really low-latency.
Low latency sockets don't rely on signals for immediate action

Most signals are self-sent from the same process. I think timer alarm is one. Sockets is another example. However, keyboard signals like Ctrl-C are not self-sent.

--fuxi: sys call is not always hardware related. my linux book has a section on sys calls related to signals!

--new: malloc != syscall
is malloc a kernel service, syscall or a userland function offered in a regular library?

Can I implement my own DAM without involving the kernel? I would say some kernel sys call is needed.

Is there a cpu instruction for heap allocation? Does cpu care about heap vs stack? Yes the CPU cares about the stack.
whilst the stack data is managed via the CPU, the heap is not managed automatically. The size of the heap can also be considerably larger than the stack and the allocation of memory must be performed manually within a program. Memory also has to be freed manually, again unlike the stack.

Can check my linux book or google on brk()

-- fuxi: set in python
set is the least used builtin container. I seldom use it, becasue dictionary is always richer.
( Similarly, list is always richer than tuple, except when used as dict keys. )

One advantage of set over dict or list -- set-comprehension to create a hashset
