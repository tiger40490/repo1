-- new or update: java: big lambdaEx^methodRef
I think a big lambdaEx (lambda expression) is usually [1] used as an argument to a method. 

Q: can we convert the big lambdaEx to a method reference?
A: not alwaysl. In Dropcopy framework, I realized that 

* many times yes I can and should convert. LambdaEx is designed for small code blocks.
* however, if the lambdaEx uses captured variables, then conversion can be difficult. I think the new method has to add a new param for every captured variable.

[1] There might be other usages, but in this blogpost I can put them aside.

For C, the #1 is the B language. It explains the naming of "C"
