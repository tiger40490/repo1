-- 外汇管理局 .. A difference between Singapore vs China government
In Singapore, the government department always has a hotline if the regulation directly affects individual citizens. The hotline usually give clear answers to guide my decision (a citizen). If things don't work out as explained, I can raise a complaint (as I did many times). Within weeks they would reach out to me and address my complaint.

In China (and U.S.), the goverment department tends to be understaffed (esp. U.S.), unable to deal with 1.4 billion citizens, let alone foreigners. 

U.S. (and PRC) government hotlines are always hard to get through and often give useless answers. We have to rely on private consultants. Whatever the source of information, if we follow it but it doesn't work, then we face an uphill battle. The government department is unlikely to offer any help. You will have to jump through many, many hoops to get it resolved.

According to DJDJ legal assistance, the SAFE gov hotline is familiar with foreign passport holders taking out inheritance.
