I have documented the A$100k proposal, otherwise I will forget some details.

First, the concept of "TanBin_share_of_BJ_home" .. is 20% of the sale proceed at time of sale (mid 2024). TanBin_share_of_BJ_home was Rmb1560k as of Aug 2024. I have since expatriated some 500k to Singapore, but TanBin_share_of_BJ_home is still Rmb1560k.

-- Base scenario (Scenario 1): grandpa lives long enough.
Suppose in early 2025, grandma decides to lend A$100k to you. I will be the intermediary/middleman and liquidity provider. I will immediately disburse A$100k to Australia from Singapore, and increase TanBin_share_of_BJ_home by the Rmb equivalent of A$100k.

By 2028 (or whatever) hopefully the entire amount of TanBin_share_of_BJ_home is in Singapore and belongs to me, and you would owe grandma A$100k, to be repaid some day.

-- Scenario 2: grandpa passing away early, after A$100k disbursement
Suppose in early 2025, grandma decides to lend A$100k to you. I will be the intermediary/middleman and liquidity provider. I will immediately disburse A$100k to Australia from Singapore, and increase TanBin_share_of_BJ_home by the Rmb equivalent of A$100k.

After his passing 
* you could clear the A$100k loan and pay back A$100k to grandma. That's between you and her.
* TanBin_share_of_BJ_home will remain at the level above Rmb1560k (suppose it's Rmb2000k). I will want to ensure I receive Rmb2000k in addition to 25% of inheritance.

I hope to simplify Scenario 2 procedure.
