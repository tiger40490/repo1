I spoke to Wang Fang, the lawyer for grandparents' last will.

I asked her about my birth cert.. same situation as your birth cert.

Here's what I found out.
* birth cert is not a mandatory document during inheritance process
* In a challenge to my identity as the son, the court may require proof of my relationship to the deceased. If no challenge, then birth cert should not be required.
* the last will (that she prepared) specifies my passport number (if not my Singapore national ID), so the passport number would be the primary ID document.
* Wang Fang also mentioned hu-kou. If you had hu-kou in the past, then it can be relevant, but only relevant in a challenge.
* The assets to be distributed would be bank account balances. So Wang Fang suggest I ask the banks to get some idea in advance.
