-- fuxi or new: wellness effort = uninspiring
I told grandpa that 1)diet and 2) weekly exercise are more important than earn-more/move-up.

However, wellness effort (esp. diet restriction) is not inspiring, not exciting, not engaging. We have to accept that, if we want to maximize our lifetime total happiness.

Some women may find diet restriction a short-term sacrifice for a huge gratification -- improved body shape.

-- fuxi: 
tanko asked: if healthy longevity is so important to you, what else are you doing beside diet and exercise?
I mentioned strong family bond, peaceful, robust response to adversities such as bonus stigma
Then I mentioned wife's health will be a key factor in my golden years. I might become more dependent on her as I grow older. I will learn to be more independent.

sexual health is another factor for "healthy longevity" though I didn't tell him.

--fuxi: grandma was right about late sleep.
she has difficulty falling asleep. Usually not a problem. 
Once a while she needs to get up early. Her late sleep habit would be clearly harmful.

--fuxi: My mom, wife and friends used to say I don't take care of my hair, my shoes, my skin, my dress...
But look at those guys who do. These guys typically lack self-discipline and now show a belly, sluggish, affected by tabaco, alcohol,,,

Can they do 20 pull-up?

--fuxi: for stable cholesterol level, one test per year is good enough. 3M test no need, esp. when I'm in the U.S.
Remember to include full blood count

--fuxi: luxury, medically unnecessary -- these commercial offerings are effective for some athletes or patients, but not clinically proven to be nearly as effective as medicines
* skincare products
* scalp treatments
* most MLM supplements
* meal timing

ERE author said "The amount we spend reflects the extent of failure in our skills and imagination"

However, in wellness I beg to differ. I would take yoga classes and go for 3M dental cleaning because I know (and accept) my failure/limitation in terms of daily flossing. 

Without maid, let's consider buying pre-washed leafy salad. More available in the U.S. 
In SG context... still Cheaper than maid and will boost my self-esteem.
