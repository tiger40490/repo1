she recommends joint mgmt with psychologist.
No hurry though.

holiday feast .. warm soup first;  minimize starch; limit cakes to 6 pieces/meal (assuming regular size).
I was reluctant to set target, but now I can accept the idea.

fasting .. I described to her milk + fruits for entire day. If below 400cal/24H, then safe to practice twice a week. My fasting is 600cal+, so no safety concern.

After age 60, can aim for BMI=25, and maintain muscle mass.
Current BMI 21.x is very good for my age.

Going back to 63 kg .. probably not something to aim at.

Why I was able to achieve 65.5 kg .. awareness; conscious self-control.

-- fuxi:
99% of foods advertized in mass media are calorie-dense by my standard -- high starch (#1 most common), high fat (#2 most common) [creamy]

I basically rely on Sys2 to ignore and avoid those attention grabbers, but Sys1 would be drawn to them automatically.

-- fuxi: I guess competition drives down the price
Aura yoga: $55 for 10D unlimited. Good for when I return to office

-- fuxi: compensation when coming home
when I come home from office, I look forward to (expectation of) a reward for the sacrifices, an unwinding of the strict control 
I feel I deserve some comfort food.

It feels too harsh to deny myself of the comfort foods.

Luckily I don't demand starch or fattty comfort foods. Fancy fruits are fine.

It is a sign of good appetite for relatively healthy foods. You don't want get rid of this appetite, do you? What you want to get rid of is the unexpected food

-- fuxi: tCost@diet introspection
I think this analysis is less reading more experimenting, and comparable to 

coding drill

mufu picking + stock picking 

renzi experiments with boy

-- fuxi: dentist tips:
more flossing please
clean the retainer
x-ray every 2Y

-- fuxi: yoyo diet
Even a temporary weight improvement is no mean achievement.

Simiarly, a high score for my son's math is no mean achievement even if his scores revert to previous levels.

today's (late Jun) Chinatown lunch is famliar. Hopefully my past experience help me improve.

Better than home cooking in terms of unlimited quantity. 3 out of 4 dishes have limited quantity. At home, generally the quantity is higher.

rice .. I had a controlled indulgence. In the next few days I will reflect. There will be very limited evidence, so I may not have enough of a rational reason to change my behavior.

leftovers .. at home, I finished some of the leftovers without rice :)

street food + YueHwa .. thanks to my full stomach (https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/2021/05/02/fullnessavailability-hunger/), I didn't buy any :) Buying would lead to "obligation". So a "controlled indulgence" is a double-edged sword with unforeseen ramification.

-- fuxi or new: wellness effort = uninspiring
I told grandpa that 1)diet and 2) weekly exercise are more important than earn-more/move-up.

However, wellness effort (esp. diet restriction) is not inspiring, not exciting, not engaging. We have to accept that, if we want to maximize our lifetime total happiness.

Some women may find diet restriction a short-term sacrifice for a huge gratification -- improved body shape.

-- fuxi
I have tried Ikea cafe food more than 10 times. I think it's slightly healthier than average. 
Obviously, at every restaurant, your personal choice of foods is the deciding factor. Ikea tends to offer more varieties of relatively healthy choices.

Still, I believe "reasonable" self-disciple in this context is simply insufficient. Your nutrional balance is probably reasonable, but there would be too much fat and insufficient vegetables. The overall cCost would be too high.

I think majority of attractive foods are similar. It's rare to find attractive yet healthy foods. 

-- fuxi: knowing that BMI is not that critical when your nutrional mix is excellent, I still want to ask
Q: is it possible to put on weight by eating lots of carrots, and other raw veg + fruits?
A: I don't think so. In theory, possible, but I seriously doubt it.

I think the amount of meat, starch and fat might be underestimated.

-- fuxi
many foods are advertised as "healthy" for no reason beside a trace amount of omega3 oil, or heart-healthy oil, or antioxidant or some fiber
The marketing propaganda exaggerates those small ingredients and say nothing about the excess amount of oil, sugar, animal fat, etc

-- fuxi
Cocacola and other beverage vendors have worked for decades to improve the appeal of sugar-free products.

I think most people still find those drinks inferior and not much better than water.

I think Colacola is trying to keep the customer hooked...

Most cusomers would buy the sugar-free version once a while, and buy the sugary version most of the time. The sugar-free version makes the customer less likely to detract.

-- fuxi: learn (on video) the basics of air-boxing to add fun to jogging. 

-- fuxi: the MLP monitor in Room2 can become a hindrance to the more-standing initiative. Detach it at times.


--fuxi: when making smoothie, remember the risk of one contaminated ingredient spoiling the entire smoothie.
If you have something very delicious or costly (time or $) then don't put too many other ingredients esp. if they could be unclean

--fuxi: floor fwd bend: better start with knees bent

--fuxi: mix veg rice without rice, with potato
I could try this more. 
Without rice, I felt less guilty, more free

-- fuxi: 
tanko asked: if healthy longevity is so important to you, what else are you doing beside diet and exercise?
I mentioned strong family bond, peaceful, robust response to adversities such as bonus stigma
Then I mentioned wife's health will be a key factor in my golden years. I might become more dependent on her as I grow older. I will learn to be more independent.

sexual health is another factor for "healthy longevity" though I didn't tell him.

--fuxi:
how would LKY or a rich guy deal with the temptations of home cooking?

What if money is not an issue? i would live away from family for several days when my diet gets out of control.
Or I could have a maid and give the left-over food to her.

-- fuxi or new: yongTauFoo+salad as stress relief
now at a time of stress, sitting outside Koufu food court, I really need some comfort food, to help me calm down.

However, not really hungry. No craving for ice cream or oily/starchy stuff (in fact, small portion of these foods would likely trigger a craving for bigger portion.. valuable self knowledge.)

Salad with some comfort components (not raw veg alone) is a good choice. Yong Tau Foo is a soup version of salad since raw veg is not popular in Chinese diet. It costs $5 but buys me mild stress relief without the cCost (and guilt/self-hate).

Now, in some cases I still need some more substantial comfort food. The big "salad" as a huge appetizer tends to reduce its portion.

--fuxi: grandma was right about late sleep.
she has difficulty falling asleep. Usually not a problem. 
Once a while she needs to get up early. Her late sleep habit would be clearly harmful.

--fuxi: bring tempting foods to office
Nowadays I bring the tempting foods to office.

The worst wrong-* temptation is night time at home. Even when I eat no starch, I still feel a loss-of-control. 

When I eat the same food the next morning or in office, I feel (much) more in-control.

--fuxi: carrot: storage cost and price tag cheaper than cucumber

--fuxi: once my stomach is stretched due to a few big meals, it tends to send stronger hunger signal earlier than before.
My mom said this many years ago. She could be right, and based on experience.

Now I have got used to big meals in 2020, I don't remember why I was able to live happily with half the food.

--fuxi
now vs 2019, my bmi is worse due to 4kg, even though
* i have maintained my starch abstinence and veg/fruit + milkshake
* I have maintained my meal delay
* I have maintained to some extent intermittent fasting. I believe (without enough evidence) that iFF I cut the late night meal then BMI would improve

I may have to accept status quo for now and keep working on BMI

--fuxi:
tiny walnut bun is
:) small price tag $1
:) small calorie load due to small size
:) tasty, but not "fulfilling" in terms of quantity. Is it a blessing or pity?
:( at my age do I care -- expensive by 100g cost

Same can be said of ice cream singles

In this stage of my life, wise to aim for minimalist 

--fuxi: 
assess the wrong-time temptation each evening. If dangerous, decisively go out to
* playground
* bus interchange
* it could be better to go to a eating place and buy a meal. Zero wrong-quantity temptation! Testimony to my self-knowledge.

--fuxi
exercise around times when you know hunger tends to strike .. may help some individuals deal with hedonic hunger. 

Some types of exercise such as short intensse workout may suppress levels of hormones known to drive appetite.

--fuxi: jogging, not yoga, gives me the confidence that I can be avialble for my son for many years.
Basically cardio wellness is the main concern.

To a lesser extent, yoga also improves my long-term wellness.

jogging is a great wellness hobby. Compared to yoga, swimming etc, jogging routine is much more "flexible"  -- Requires fewer facilities, therefore, no timing restrictions when in the mood.

--fuxi:
at my age now, am more focused on cutting daily calories than cutting daily expenses.

belt-tightening is my traditional strength

--fuxi: My mom, wife and friends used to say I don't take care of my hair, my shoes, my skin, my dress...
But look at those guys who do. These guys typically lack self-discipline and now show a belly, sluggish, affected by tabaco, alcohol,,,

Can they do 20 pull-up?

--fuxi: for a retired athelete, the lifelong wellness depends on the lifestyle in post-retirement.

Most visible lifestyle factor is each person's BMI profile.

--fuxi: dental care
i need more brushing, perhaps more frequent
I , meimei and boy need more frequent dental checks
meimei need to avoid sweet and also hard food

--fuxi
if you are serious about visible fat, then avoid meat coated with flour. More than half the times I find pieces of fat (or skin) concealed by the coating.

since boy lacks self-control, i can  bring his bad food to office and giving away
What he enjoys most is the buying not the eating !

Boy should pay for it.

most foods pictured in commercials are calorie-dense

People get used to calorie-dense foods and crave for more. Food outlets and visual advertisements cater to their craving

--fuxi: 
Around the time of SiemReap flight booking, I ate quite a lot of starchy foods grandma bought or cooked.

This is a classic case study.

One factor is stress. The flight booking was stressful.

One factor is wrong-* temptations. In this case, there was a bit of wrong-time temptation in the morning after the flight booking. I was not hungry, but I gave in to the temptation after the food was heated.

One factor is quality of nutrition. This starchy food is not as bad as creamy cakes or ice cream. I also ate carrot for balance.
 
One of the biggest factors in my mind was quantity of calories. I can only guesstimate that the quantity was huge.

This blogpost is about diet. Beyond diet, a major factor affecting my zsms is the burn/rot/roti on that day. I had a coding drill with Ashish, one of the toughest in 3 months. I then went back to office and did a bit of work. In office I had a stressful call with NCT. I also had a useful dabao coaching session on word problem, one of the most significant in a year. The cambodia trip legwork (visa, flight) was a major effort. I also had a few lotus sessions including in ofifce.. In hindsight, I dismissed/forgot these non-trivial achievements on that day and zoomed into the diet "loss of control".

--fuxi: 3:52 PM 2/3/2020, 
Without maid, let's consider buying pre-washed leafy salad. More available in the U.S. 
In SG context... still Cheaper than maid and will boost my self-esteem.

ERE author said "The amount we spend reflects the extent of failure in our skills and imagination"

However, in wellness I beg to differ. I would take yoga classes and go for 3M dental cleaning because I know (and accept) my failure/limitation in terms of daily flossing. 

-- fuxi: many women are married to husbands who don't pay enough attention to flexibility. Both husband and wife suffer as a result
Men are natually tighter.
I feel proud about my commitment (more than attitude) to flexibility. I think it's foresight.

-- fuxi: looking at my yoga classmates including many super-flexible women, I remind myself that they are probably unimpressive in fitness, balance, strength etc.

I realize my priorities are
1) BMI
2) cardio and muscle endurance
) strength
) flexibility
) power

So I feel my current position is superior and enviable compared to them.

--fuxi: stretch in shower: prefer sitting postures for safety.

-- fuxi: Like the challenge of sustainable yoga. Chin-up is a smaller challenge. 
I think the key is frequency. Aim at a few reps every day or every 2 days.

-- fuxi
Yoga is not a contest. 

When I'm very tight in some part, then certain pose is tough but beneficial, and good ROI and ROTI. 
In contrast, some very flexible students don't improve and don't benefit much in terms of flexibility (they come for relaxation), and may feel compelled to go into more advanced poses. I guess those poses are more difficult and dangerous, therefore hard to practice without assistance, 

-- fuxi: flexibility is a lifelong struggle, visible weakness
Rather few parts of my life has been this difficult.

persistent, hopeless lack of positive feedback .. Promethean struggle.
-- fuxi: Belinda pointed out mobility vs flexibility (obstacle holding some body part) 
She hinted that mobility might be more important to many older people, in everyday living.

== fuxi: buy a yoga mat
Leave it on the floor everyday. Not so much space
A kind of nudge. It may or may not be enough to overcome the huge obstacle. 

Sugg: get wife to ..

When I bought the standing desk, I also envisioned using it for leg stretch ..

-- Disuse after honeymoon? If it can increase my practice by 1h/week for 20 weeks, it's worthwhile. But I don't envision myself keep it there for years.
cost compared to yoga classes?
cost compared to the importance of stretch?

I had a blue yoga mat for years ... 

Q: lifestyle creep, knowing that after 20 weeks it would be put away?

-- fuxi
some yoga teacher/students probably welcome male students.

* tight male students can help make some students feel less tight
* strong male students often has better energy, balance or endurance
* teacher would feel good to have a wider range of participants

-- fuxi:
when I tell yoga teachers that I'm still beginner, they may worry that I would be negative about their teaching. 

It's like bad-mouthing past employers during a job interview.

--fuxi: advice from two BGC yoga instructors on my lower-back fwd bend.
* standard fwd-bend can also include knee-bend to provide better focus on lower-back.

Since tight hamstring often interfere with lower-back stretching, each time we need to prioritize between them. Lower back is more important than hamstring.

--fuxi: Saumik advice:
stretch should be enjoyable, not painful. I guess it should be tolerable if not enjoyable.

fish pose with block support below the hip and head.

--fuxi: for stable cholesterol level, one test per year is good enough. 3M test no need, esp. when I'm in the U.S.
Remember to include full blood count

--fuxi: wellness review on bizclass flight, another daily battle
* salad very healthy, without dressing. I ate more salad today than any day over last 6M
* three servings of fruits
* rice I didn't eat up, better than before
* some stretching
* restraint on cakes, chocolate, ice cream etc, not as unconstrained as before 
* before the flight, I did eat lots of fruits + radish

--fuxi: luxury, medically unnecessary -- these commercial offerings are effective for some athletes or patients, but not clinically proven to be nearly as effective as medicines
* skincare products
* scalp treatments
* most MLM supplements
* meal timing
