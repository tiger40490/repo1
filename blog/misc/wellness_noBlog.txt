--fuxi: bring tempting foods to office
Nowadays I bring the tempting foods to office.

The worst wrong-* temptation is night time at home. Even when I eat no starch, I still feel a loss-of-control. 

When I eat the same food the next morning or in office, I feel (much) more in-control.

--fuxi: carrot: storage cost and price tag cheaper than cucumber

--fuxi: once my stomach is stretched due to a few big meals, it tends to send stronger hunger signal earlier than before.
My mom said this many years ago. She could be right, and based on experience.

Now I have got used to big meals in 2020, I don't remember why I was able to live happily with half the food.

--fuxi
now vs 2019, my bmi is worse due to 4kg, even though
* i have maintained my starch abstinence and veg/fruit + milkshake
* I have maintained my meal delay
* I have maintained to some extent intermittent fasting. I believe (without enough evidence) that iFF I cut the late night meal then BMI would improve

I may have to accept status quo for now and keep working on BMI

--fuxi:
tiny walnut bun is
:) small price tag $1
:) small calorie load due to small size
:) tasty, but not "fulfilling" in terms of quantity. Is it a blessing or pity?
:( at my age do I care -- expensive by 100g cost

Same can be said of ice cream singles

In this stage of my life, wise to aim for minimalist 

--fuxi: 
assess the wrong-time temptation each evening. If dangerous, decisively go out to
* playground
* bus interchange
* it could be better to go to a eating place and buy a meal. Zero wrong-quantity temptation! Testimony to my self-knowledge.

exercise around times when you know hunger tends to strike .. may help some individuals deal with hedonic hunger. 

Some types of exercise such as short intensse workout may suppress levels of hormones known to drive appetite.

--fuxi: jogging, not yoga, gives me the confidence that I can be avialble for my son for many years.
Basically cardio wellness is the main concern.

To a lesser extent, yoga also improves my long-term wellness.

jogging is a great wellness hobby. Compared to yoga, swimming etc, jogging routine is much more "flexible"  -- Requires fewer facilities, therefore, no timing restrictions when in the mood.

--fuxi:
at my age now, am more focused on cutting daily calories than cutting daily expenses.

belt-tightening is my traditional strength

--fuxi: My mom, wife and friends used to say I don't take care of my hair, my shoes, my skin, my dress...
But look at those guys who do. These guys typically lack self-discipline and now show a belly, sluggish, affected by tabaco, alcohol,,,

Can they do 20 pull-up?

--fuxi: for a retired athelete, the lifelong wellness depends on the lifestyle in post-retirement.

Most visible lifestyle factor is each person's BMI profile.

--fuxi: dental care
i need more brushing, perhaps more frequent
I , meimei and boy need more frequent dental checks
meimei need to avoid sweet and also hard food

--fuxi
if you are serious about visible fat, then avoid meat coated with flour. More than half the times I find pieces of fat (or skin) concealed by the coating.

since boy lacks self-control, i can  bring his bad food to office and giving away
What he enjoys most is the buying not the eating !

Boy should pay for it.

most foods pictured in commercials are calorie-dense

People get used to calorie-dense foods and crave for more. Food outlets and visual advertisements cater to their craving

Around the time of SiemReap flight booking, I ate quite a lot of starchy foods grandma bought or cooked.

This is a classic case study.

One factor is stress. The flight booking was stressful.

One factor is wrong-* temptations. In this case, there was a bit of wrong-time temptation in the morning after the flight booking. I was not hungry, but I gave in to the temptation after the food was heated.

One factor is quality of nutrition. This starchy food is not as bad as creamy cakes or ice cream. I also ate carrot for balance.
 
One of the biggest factors in my mind was quantity of calories. I can only guesstimate that the quantity was huge.

This blogpost is about diet. Beyond diet, a major factor affecting my zsms is the burn/rot/roti on that day. I had a coding drill with Ashish, one of the toughest in 3 months. I then went back to office and did a bit of work. In office I had a stressful call with NCT. I also had a useful dabao coaching session on word problem, one of the most significant in a year. The cambodia trip legwork (visa, flight) was a major effort. I also had a few lotus sessions including in ofifce.. In hindsight, I dismissed/forgot these non-trivial achievements on that day and zoomed into the diet "loss of control".

Without maid, let's consider buying pre-washed leafy salad. More available in the U.S. 
In SG context... still Cheaper than maid and will boost my self-esteem.

ERE author said "The amount we spend reflects the extent of failure in our skills and imagination"

However, in wellness I beg to differ. I would take yoga classes and go for 3M dental cleaning because I know (and accept) my failure/limitation in terms of daily flossing. 

--fuxi: advice from two BGC yoga instructors on my lower-back fwd bend.
* standard fwd-bend can also include knee-bend to provide better focus on lower-back.

Since tight hamstring often interfere with lower-back stretching, each time we need to prioritize between them. Lower back is more important than hamstring.

--fuxi: Saumik advice:
stretch should be enjoyable, not painful. I guess it should be tolerable if not enjoyable.

fish pose with block support below the hip and head.

--fuxi: for stable cholesterol level, one test per year is good enough. 3M test no need, esp. when I'm in the U.S.
Remember to include full blood count

--fuxi: wellness review on bizclass flight, another daily battle
* salad very healthy, without dressing. I ate more salad today than any day over last 6M
* three servings of fruits
* rice I didn't eat up, better than before
* some stretching
* restraint on cakes, chocolate, ice cream etc, not as unconstrained as before 
* before the flight, I did eat lots of fruits + radish

--fuxi: luxury, medically unnecessary -- these commercial offerings are effective for some athletes or patients, but not clinically proven to be nearly as effective as medicines
* skincare products
* scalp treatments
* most MLM supplements
* meal timing
