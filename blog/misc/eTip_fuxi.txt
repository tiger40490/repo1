When cursor is in either screen, try 3-finger touchpad swipe-up. You can then choose a window to show on-top in that screen. The selected window could belong to the remote or home computer

On an unrelated note, you can also try 3-finger swipe-down.. will immediately minimize all windows and reveal home computerâ€™s desktop. At this juncture a swipe-up would restore everything.

-- fuxi: archive/hide threads on wechat/whatsapp
The list of wechat contacts, the list of linkedin contacts are filled with people I seldom NEED to contact. I dare not delete them because I have no other way to recover their contacts!

The high cost -- With wechat (linkedin much better), these people receive too much sunshine simply because they appear on this wechat list. 

1) It's better to remove them from wechat contact if I have other ways to find them, such email or through other friends.
2) For some other contacts, it's better to archive/hide the conversation thread. This feature is similar to Archive on gmail.
3) ^^^^ In the end, my wechat front page should show only 9 worthwhile contacts.

The wechat/whatsapp/linkedin lifestyle is for people whose personal time and priorities fall within their (large) circle of friends. This lifestyle is a very poor match for my needs. 

I do have a need to connect with a small circle of "friends and family". I much prefer 1) meet-up 2) email. Phone call is a distant third choice. Chat is the worst choice for me.
