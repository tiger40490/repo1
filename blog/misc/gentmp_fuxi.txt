--fuxi jolt: when I get fixated on brank I had better remember perception of reality

* Look, this guy has a fancy car... but a car is a liability not an cashcow assets like div stock
* Do they have a beautiful wife?
* Do they have a branded degree?
* Do they have an accomplished father?
* Do they have a healthy mother?
* Do they have two lovely kids?

--fuxi: good to review my reactions to random adversities
* trespass
* credit card fraud
* overcharge on my accounts

--fuxi: worst stressful period=2008-09
After boy was born, my stress profile deteriorated quickly over long and short term. T-budget strain.. heavy responsibility
I had no passive income  to supplement my salary,,, belt-tightening
My stress profile was significantly worse than 2006 in SG, despite my higher income. 

fear of job loss
I had no "multiple countries" to choose from. I fact I felt trapped and unwanted. I briefly considered quitting the U.S. returning to SG...
PIP was the main stressor
Salary was low -- actually a stressor since U.S. burn rate was much higher than in SG.
long commute from Brooklyn. Couldn't afford $2.5k rental in Jersey City.
Camp-out was a relief
java market depth as a parachute, cushion and safety net, was unavailable to me at that time.

--fuxi: grandpa said I need to slow down in speaking

--the 2 recurring pains captured in my blogs
1) PIP
2) peer comparison -- such as left-behind, brank (but how about beautiful wife, wellness, edu credentials)

Now I can name the 3rd recurring pain -- boy's current (rather than longer-horizon) academic situation, such as (but not limited to) motivation level and time-mgmt

--fuxi: bindi's suggestion:
look in the mirror and tell yourself "You are good enough".

Q: Do you ever think it's vulnerable to acknowledge and disclose your true weakness?
A: Sometimes I believe it's a sign of strength, but only when the weakness is something I am comfortable with, not my worst weakness

====martyrdom 
martyrdom is fundamentally related to my burn/rot concept

-- Origin of this word -- One who voluntarily suffers death as the penalty for refusing to renounce their religion

-- idealist purity
By my standard, every human is lazy, weak, loser

-- no pain no gain -- is A related phrase. I addressed this point when a MorganStanley colleague described my extreme diet as self-discipline (more like self-restraint). I said deprivation is unsustainable.

-- Burn/rot is mostly materialistic pursuit + self-discipline ... martyrdom?

--jolt:
my introspective self-discovery is iterative, self-correcting and endless like editing a wikipedia article. 
I don't feel very effective because there are always too many things I don't understand about myself...

However, I never feel inferior (hopeless compared to "them") as felt in yoga, coding practice, or moving-up

--no blog
If no kids, then I feel I would have won the war against FOMO and pretty much all the battles I care to fight.

If no wife, then I would have won more completely more comfortably.

--fuxi: 
Singaporean amateur sports participants tend to use high-end equipment because... they can afford it.

I used to say that despite the world-class facilities, SG is not producing world-class athletes. 

Now I feel a major goal of the SG government is promoting physical wellness of the average Singaporeans. So quality of facilities do matter. 

--fuxi:
Chinese students are no longer the most motivated once in college. Other nationalities catch up as they find the motivation.

I think my son may be that type of late bloomer

My sister is a late bloomer. She didn't give up working hard.

On the job, I can see the Chinese colleagues NOT more motivated than other nationalities, not at all.

--no hurry Q: am I avoiding the tough and high-leverage "burn" jobs?
* yoga ... is by far the toughest job... actually am taking on the challenge 
* jogging .. is more comfortable than yoga
* pull-up and push-up
* coding drill
(QQ is more comfortable than coding drill)
* BGC planning  -- am taking it on by talking to Raymond and Chun Tih. Not really high leverage.
* boy's math -- am taking it on
* work project and localSys xx -- am taking on some of the challenges. 
* FX robot? not so tough
* standing to work

--fuxi: more popular more powerful tools != always better
even though there are more powerful tools than treeSizeFree, I found this tool simple and effective.

Even though there are more powerful tools than wordweb, I found this tool simple and effective.

--fuxi: do not remove usb cable from TV while transferring files.

--fuxi: endocrinology -- sounds like end of creek
--fuxi: tech xx on youtube
why my friends all prefer videos to reading text, even for tech xx
it requires less focused attention.
I feel most of them don't re-visit.

--Filipinos (Caribbeans? Nigerians?) can speak decent Eng but 
Most can't earn a living in US/UK/Canada/Australia or Singapore.

Language proficiency is necessary but insufficient... There are huge cultural differences between two English-speaking countries at different affluence levels.

Affluence (more than the technology) determines the culture.

--fuxi: the more carefully I prepare something, the higher my risk of disappointment
* eg: prepare math worksheet for boy
* eg: wife or mom prepares a meal for me
* eg: quant study
* eg: many weekends bring boy out and study renzi

--fuxi: biggest problem with singtel prepaid card: accidental data usage
how do I block it permanently?

As soon as I buy a new card or refill card, I should disable internet

Over this hibernation period I could target
respect at work
weight and diet habit 
boy's studies -- benchmark++
net savings, 
fitness -- esp. yoga, 
coding drill -- hard to measure
QQ gain -- easier than coding drill
...

qSG period I focused on some questionable targets (dnlg QQ, C++/c# trec, branch-out, renzi) and didn't feel fulfilled, probably due to PIP. I did achieve basic ffree and trec in c++.

c++US period I had success with c++ trec, weight, yoga, coding drill, housing plan, but rather few visible progress.

as I age, more resources focused on wellness, parenting, per-investment, unfortunately less on tech xx

I can possibly focus on maintenance -- coreJava, c++. coding drill? Not sure

Which do I prefer? #all relatively unbalanced, but realistic

Scenario 1: maintain the super-healthy weight (64kg) and diet; some respect; no visible progress esp. with boy

Scenario 2: QQ build-up, maintain c++critical mass, keep up coding drill, weight maintain at 66 kg but no other visible progress

Scenario 3: huge time on math without benchmark improvement; some respect; but no visible progress.

Scenario 4: some time on math without benchmark improvement; some respect; some QQ/codingDrill; weight back up to 67 - 70kg

--no blogpost: my current struggles #tectonic:
^ respect and figure-out-speed ] localSys
v boy's math? Is it my job or his job? In theory If I don't take any ownership then the pressure is completely off ... but realistically?
* [t] calorie count? I feel the Singapore climate adds 5 kg, even if my starch intake is halved 3 times
v yoga? now easier once I paid the membership fee :)
v c++/coreJava critical mass maintenance 
v [t?] CIV? LG2. How about review or simple problems?
v personal finance including housing plan
* [t=tough struggle]

--fuxi: detach: am I holding too tight onto ...?
my fitness including flexibility?
my diet and weight control? 
my c++/java QQ 
my "conquest" of the age-friendly Wall St job market

--new? no
as soon as I set up an "expectation" in any of these areas (often for self-motivation), i can hit disappointments, stress, tough "adjustments"
* intimacy
* GC
* bonus
* consistent coding drill
* weight, chin-up, consistent yoga
* my cholesterol level
* boy's math

--nothing new: Over the 2019 final days in the U.S. i felt very lucky
* surprise improvement -- C++ critical mass while coreJava remains a competency
* surprise improvement -- CIV is now becoming my 2nd competitive advantage after QQ
* [unbroken] health + vitality 
* [unbroken] marriage
* new plan of dev-till-70
* surprise improvement -- most young talents shun the contract job market, for fundamental reasons, leaving the field wide open to me.
* surprise improvement (tentative) -- startup and web2.0 shops are emerging as new frontiers, beside ibanks. Remember the c#/quant/swing adventures
* surprise improvement (short term) -- contract rate slowly rising

With my marketable skills + health, in the U.S. everything will work out in my personal life, 
* even though U.S. convenience level is low
* even though U.S. commute is much worse than SG. Some WFH will help.
* even though my kids may not become top students
* even though my wife may not find meaningful job

--no blog
Rahul put his heart into the job. I think my sister does that too.

My son might as well. I need to appreciate that.

I put my heart into theoretical learning, which I want to show my son 

--fuxi x 2
enjoying the airport lounge food, I feel my kids would feel .... privileged?
But I don't want them to feel inferior when they don't have it. So perhaps the feeling of privilege is a double-edged sword, to be managed.

Perhaps most of us can't remove the sense of privilege or inferiority/deprivation.

I have a chance to emerge from the crowd and remove that sense. I have intellectual power

--fuxi x 3
perhaps I have an adjustment problem with negative feedback. 
The problem is my reaction to the feedback. 
I feel my sister and my son may be more effective. 

I feel I can do better. I can learn coping strategies. 
I can relax as grandpa suggested. 
I can learn to live in peace with the negative feedback. 
If I put in a reasonable effort and manager accepts it without a bonus, then I feel I can be happy. 
If I put in a reasonable effort but manager clearly indicates "unacceptable", then I feel i would take action to leave

Overall, my reaction to PIP is weaker than my reaction to IV setbacks. 
Traditionally, one of my strengths is positive attitude to IV setbacks. 
It is easy to look at the gap and feel hopeless.

Parenting also requires this capacity. [[Learned optimism]]] listed Permanent as one hallmark of pessimists.

The honeymoon of engagement (on coding drill, localSys, GTD, emailing to friends ..) is joy and pleasure in itself.

eg@engage: morning quiet time... the zone
eg@engage: on flights
eg@engage: weekend coding assignments

--intrinsic mtv is rather rare in most commercial domains

Arts (including fine arts..) are more likely. Personalized service (like nursing, counseling) also possible

--fuxi x 1:
After reading A.Brooks, I assumed that grandpa's health would suffer if he loses relevance after retirement. 

He is very sure it won't happen. He said people in his circle basically keep working until physically unable. He foresees his life to be really busy for a few more years until his health prevents him from working. 

He actually believe his active workload at age 84 is harming his health. I feel irrelevance would be more detrimental to his health, but perhaps he has never thought of irrelevance.

--fuxi x 2: I feel Indians have a problem with slim. I feel their culture associates slim with something negative, perhaps poverty?

In Chinese culture, I can see that BMI 19 is considered unattractive.

In reality, thinning is healthy for most people.

... Likewise, I'm brainwashed to worship brank and overvalue work place interpersonal skills. I'm not good at them but I have something better .. ffree and easy-life (as QiChongLei puts it).
--fuxi x 3: unbroken.. a few nice items
wrist watch
body scale
etone callback
intimacy
weight
