eg: medical
eg: financial product knowledge?
eg: quant?
best eg: coding skills. At any income level and skill level there's healthy demand

--fuxi: Some people study a new topic like socket or FIX or mkt data but can't answer interview questions.
This is very common and should not be a source of shame.

what would I do in my 70's before or when I couldn't find a full time job?
In 2014, A Trac consultant trainer told a class of OCBC trainees that he would teach for free...

Some successful people reach the peak of their career in their 30's or 40's. After that, they become advisors or decision makers for a committee. They make use of the relationships, judgements...
My dad is different. He is still productive in his 80's.

Am not one of those successful people. I am just a professional interviewee/programmer for Wall St. 

software dev career is somewhat different, but I feel it still resembles some traditional domains like ...?

Above 35 ... considered too old for coding job. Screened out by Many hiring teams. 

Those above 35 need to move into mgmt or consider something else

9-9-6 culture

In Shanghai, above RMB 30k/M is hard.  

MS fresh grades RMB 300k/Y, then slow increment towards 500k

--fuxi: people like NCT are very effective without written records, no email, ..
In such a work env I would show my weakness in the form of dependency on written record, reflective bogging... 

In a working env with theoretical (math) complexities, or low-level details, I have a clear advantage.

in SG k-12 schools, i quickly had a deep and complete feeling that no local student was bold, innovative like me, and all were too conformable and compliant.

In hind sight, I can see that some small percentage of local students were unconventional like me, but they didn't want to show it.

* foreign students in local schools -- In local schools, there are also many foreign students, but I consider Malaysian students local.
* non-local schools -- I would guess in international schools the culture would be more diverse, with students from far away or developed countries
* Singapore students educated overseas -- some of them are not so conformable.
* university instead of 1-12 -- I found more local students like me
* At the workplace -- many local graduates are not so conformable.

Within a month, You can often (not always) predict a worker's long-term attitude?
On this job I feel I would continue for a few months to show commitment (to deadlines), dedication (not so much distraction), sense of urgency ..

How about mvea job? I think I became distracted and spent too many work hours on non-work like nutrition, housing, QQ, 
 
Q: why I feel more dedicated (and motivated) on this job compared to earlier jobs?

* colleagues are less dedicated, but same at OC
* a small but growing sense of urgency
* I feel I could exceed mgr expectation with 90% effort

--fuxi: my 1st aid blogposts tend to cluster around 2 central themes -- PIP and peerComp

very different intensities

The peerComp tends to be based on very limited facts and mostly biased imagination.

--in terms of QQ (hard questions by definition), 
95% of the c++0x features cluster around mv-semantics. 

I think this is because c++ is a low-level language.

Also the other template features (beside forward()) are not so prominent.

--I still want to do c++. If I do a gr8 job in this java team, I might get a chance to take on some c++ work.

Recall the CG/velocity projects I might have some advantages as those guys aren't superstars.

I told Rahul that I need to be independent to capture the engagement, but that's short term.

Over long term, what do I need to survive and thrive?
* sustained focus on localSys
* respect/appreciation
* not boxed into some unfavorable technology like high-churn

perhaps the big picture insight (Josh, Rahul) is equally imp as the Local localSys, but i still feel figure-out speed is my real weakness.

Jiang Ling felt programming till 70 is no problem. Demand is not such an obstacle. 
Jiang Ling felt nowadays there are many ways to do coding job at home.

I feel teaching might be good for me.

-- new: self-img
I want to be seen as dedicated, motivated, committed ..
but I want to FEEL self-esteem regardless of GTD speed. 
To that end, Macq experience was a defining, watershed event, when I did my best but the standard was too high. I ought to feel proud of myself.

i feel good about my focus and my strength to resist the temptations. I hope this becomes a positive feedback loop of respect/confidence/self-esteem even without faster progress on projects

I think bosses like Josh would notice the effort even if without impressive progress.

Q: how important is continuous coding drill?
Q: how important is refresh to my CIV performance?
Q: how important is refresh to my c++ critical mass?

ideally, i would feel more self-esteem and self-mastery if I can continue my coding drill at 1H a week. However, now I feel localSys and project progress is more important to my self-esteem.

--no blog but deep impact
As soon as we start to work towards better salary , we are on a slippery slope. 
We may feel we are on a reasonable ground, with a reasonable goal, but down the slope there is irrationality, desperation, greed, self-hate, inferiority...
we tend to keep up with the Jones's. Many people compare with the wrong peer group .. including the web2.0 shops
We tend to neglect many valuable things that at end of our lives we would recognize as more important than the rat race

One of the jolting, awakening (一盆凉水) questions is - Granted other people earn a lot more, but i don't need that much money to live a comfortable life, so why do I feel inadequate so often?

I told many friends that I work hard to prepare for interviews but I am Very selective about where to join. 
I focus mostly on the salary level in the WallSt contract market, not the perm salaries. 
This kind of attitude is one small step towards a more rational, more pragmatic perception of the rat race

If I were in a high-cost location where typical household burn rate is 15k, then I would be under pressure to earn more just to keep up.

Like Black developers .. As an older Singaporean developer I also have higher visibility.
IFF I apply myself (localSys) and establish a foundation at a new site as Piroz does, I think I could survive and possibly show my hidden strengths.

However, at Stirt I was unable to outshine other guys.

At Macq, I was unable to impress bosses.

Chris Ma felt any programming job is intense, never lethargic. I tend to consider some support type of work as coding. Chris felt a relatively easy programming job might be good for my brain. 

Now I feel this view echoes Jiang Ling's view

--Chris asked "Have you considered other professions"
I mentioned teaching; Chinese school for young kids; startup .. but I was not serious not passionate.

In hind sight I basically presented an image as a graying techie interested in coding, esp. low-level coding, and low-level, almost theoretical knowledge. 

--I told Chris my bias towards U.S. job market
* open-door policy towards graying techies
* lower stress, for multiple reasons
* plenty of jobs, at least in tristate area
* tech jobs are growing and we are in-demand, even at our age. I said we are both lucky. Chris said in the future there will be only IT jobs.
* my competitiveness among older techies
* decent contract rate
* market depth:
US tech salary very high, so even a mediocre tech job pays well above traditional jobs. Dev jobs pays even higher than regular tech jobs.

Gave me sense of security

Rahul is ambitious , same as Sunil, Ashish, Yang .... I'm not. I just want to do a professional job and stay at a level I'm comfortable

--compared to Rahul putting his heart into a job..
In recent years, my focus was on ffree, IV maintenance (contract rate),... 
... not promotion, or staying long and growing my value-add 

Corporate ambition, stress, competition, serious designs ... threatens to reduce my easy life and give me cancer!

--nothing really new here. 
when a bright new hire is brought into the team he would be benchmarked from Day 1 over the next 6M. Consider Deepak G, Alan Shi, ...
I'm often not-so-great in terms of localSys ramp-up, GTD etc, but I often put in visible effort
In contrast, My interview benchmark result is often extraordinary.

--Retire at Google?
CSDoctor thinks it's possible but I doubt it
However CSDoctor questions himself "To present myself as a team lead or architect, what do I have to offer them?"

I think a large established firm (MLP, goog, AT&T) are more tolerant of "retirees"

--new paradox: if I feel basically semi-retired on my rental income, why do I envy those with higher income?

I feel I'm able to feel OK with conserver lifestyle, but my family members would not feel so comfortable. See my blog on deprivation.

Pattern: 
Suddenly I happen to notice a few "peers" getting ahead in terms of salary ... and I get hit by the same inferiority complex as before.
Actually, people 10 years younger are not my peers
Actually, the manager types aren't my peers, as grandpa pointed out repeatedly.

Q: what do I treasure more? I don't really need the 20% extra income. 
A: easy life -- PIP, stigma .. are real risks in my career.
A: beautiful wife
A: SG citizenship
A: wellness
A: cash flow freedom over 20Y or till end of my life
A: robust career. Their careers may not be so robust if you look closely

sg job market remains as slow and thin as before. Still financial jobs constitute 90% of my job pool
JC has more suitable jobs than SG has including start-up.

Singapore non-finance companies simply can't afford because the main street dev salary is much lower than U.S.

The wall st salary level is largely influenced by west coast and also main street dev salary. No such influence in SG
