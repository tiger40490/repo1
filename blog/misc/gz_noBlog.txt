Let's see how it catches on

I think mono project may be better off as independent but endorsed by Microsoft

--fuxi: oth: system architect career path that Qihao described 
I'm biased against such a career path. I think some interviewers expect the contractor to bring valuable experience to the table and propose solutions (to be decided by the app owner)

Q: was I able to play that role? 
A: I think Josh actually felt I was able to. I think that was at a micro level, but I might be able to at higher level as well.

A: I think Venkat and Shubin actually noticed it 

I think Yang, Chad... were more successful doing this, though I didn't like Yang's java solutions. 

I probably have a blogpost on my past record. Overall, I think this "promise" is not easy to deliver. My track record was mixed.

In recent jobs, I have not been very keen, determined to overcome the challenges and propose new ideas. To score a point, I don't really need to get it implemented. 

I feel at Mvea I lost the initial drive.

--fuxi: plowback into c++
After my java conquest, I decided to avoid build-up to jxee. I decided to deepen and branch-out to c++.

I believed the stability of c++ would favor older coders like me, but now I feel c++ is mostly chosen by HFT i.e. type2. 
The type1/type3 WallSt c++ shops represent roughly half the market and (yes!) provided some small ROI.

c++ did help my coreJava QQ.

c++ did strengthen my profile and confidence at web2.0 interviews, as coreJava isn't so dominant therein.

Overall, the plowback is effective but underwhelming. 
It would be more effective where coreJava is less dominant, as in web2.0 and microsoft shops.

similar to TYY, these individuals are good at climbing up (for reasons I am not able/interested to elaborate)
When one of them eventualy moves up, I feel the pain of FOLB.
This is one of the 2 most common pains in my blog, but progressively becoming less painful less devastating as I age.
(As I age, my self-mgmt advantages have started to emerge -- wellness, cashfow, career longevity,,,)

Their brank and their career-peak income is not badly needed in my life,,,

See also t_expert and gzMgr^contractor, t_gzPeerComp

* lifelong income
* age friendly - wall st contractor?
* competition from younger players -- is worse in more visible, more lucrative positions.
* career stability -- is better in my case due to mediocre salary
* mkt depth -- is better in many dev positions because salary is mediocre
* do I need the extra income?
* easy life?

--fuxi: Ashish 
At my age, I don't need to be a strong coder
I only need to maintain my IV form -- both QQ and CIV

--fuxi: the hottest c++ job domain is HFT, but
.. but they underpay web2.0 and they only pay slightly more than ibanks
.. but the skillset is not portable or upstream to java ! I think it's rather niche
I think the c++ latency QQ knowledge is 99% bookish, not GTD skills at all.

--fuxi: top professional skills having mktDepth+$value
eg: medical
eg: financial product knowledge?
eg: quant?
best eg: coding skills. At any income level and skill level there's healthy demand

--fuxi: Some people study a new topic like socket or FIX or mkt data but can't answer interview questions.
This is very common and should not be a source of shame.

what would I do in my 70's before or when I couldn't find a full time job?
In 2014, A Trac consultant trainer told a class of OCBC trainees that he would teach for free...

Some successful people reach the peak of their career in their 30's or 40's. After that, they become advisors or decision makers for a committee. They make use of the relationships, judgements...
My dad is different. He is still productive in his 80's.

Am not one of those successful people. I am just a professional interviewee/programmer for Wall St. 

software dev career is somewhat different, but I feel it still resembles some traditional domains like ...?

--fuxi: realities of China developers
Above 35 ... considered too old for coding job. Screened out by Many hiring teams. 

Those above 35 need to move into mgmt or consider something else

9-9-6 culture

In Shanghai, above RMB 30k/M is hard.  

MS fresh grades RMB 300k/Y, then slow increment towards 500k

--fuxi: people like NCT are very effective without written records, no email, ..
In such a work env I would show my weakness in the form of dependency on written record, reflective bogging... 

In a working env with theoretical (math) complexities, or low-level details, I have a clear advantage.

in SG k-12 schools, i quickly had a deep and complete feeling that no local student was bold, innovative like me, and all were too conformable and compliant.

In hind sight, I can see that some small percentage of local students were unconventional like me, but they didn't want to show it.

* foreign students in local schools -- In local schools, there are also many foreign students, but I consider Malaysian students local.
* non-local schools -- I would guess in international schools the culture would be more diverse, with students from far away or developed countries
* Singapore students educated overseas -- some of them are not so conformable.
* university instead of 1-12 -- I found more local students like me
* At the workplace -- many local graduates are not so conformable.

Within a month, You can often (not always) predict a worker's long-term attitude?
On this job I feel I would continue for a few months to show commitment (to deadlines), dedication (not so much distraction), sense of urgency ..

How about mvea job? I think I became distracted and spent too many work hours on non-work like nutrition, housing, QQ, 
 
Q: why I feel more dedicated (and motivated) on this job compared to earlier jobs?

* colleagues are less dedicated, but same at OC
* a small but growing sense of urgency
* I feel I could exceed mgr expectation with 90% effort

--fuxi: my 1st aid blogposts tend to cluster around 2 central themes -- PIP and peerComp

very different intensities

The peerComp tends to be based on very limited facts and mostly biased imagination.

--in terms of QQ (hard questions by definition), 
95% of the c++0x features cluster around mv-semantics. 

I think this is because c++ is a low-level language.

Also the other template features (beside forward()) are not so prominent.

--I still want to do c++. If I do a gr8 job in this java team, I might get a chance to take on some c++ work.

Recall the CG/velocity projects I might have some advantages as those guys aren't superstars.

I told Rahul that I need to be independent to capture the engagement, but that's short term.

Over long term, what do I need to survive and thrive?
* sustained focus on localSys
* respect/appreciation
* not boxed into some unfavorable technology like high-churn

perhaps the big picture insight (Josh, Rahul) is equally imp as the Local localSys, but i still feel figure-out speed is my real weakness.

Jiang Ling felt programming till 70 is no problem. Demand is not such an obstacle. 
Jiang Ling felt nowadays there are many ways to do coding job at home.

I feel teaching might be good for me.

I want to be seen as dedicated, motivated, committed ..
but I want to FEEL self-esteem regardless of GTD speed. 
To that end, Macq experience was a defining, watershed event, when I did my best but the standard was too high. I ought to feel proud of myself.

i feel good about my focus and my strength to resist the temptations. I hope this becomes a positive feedback loop of respect/confidence/self-esteem even without faster progress on projects

I think bosses like Josh would notice the effort even if without impressive progress.

Q: how important is continuous coding drill?
Q: how important is refresh to my CIV performance?
Q: how important is refresh to my c++ critical mass?

ideally, i would feel more self-esteem and self-mastery if I can continue my coding drill at 1H a week. However, now I feel localSys and project progress is more important to my self-esteem.

--no blog but deep impact
As soon as we start to work towards better salary , we are on a slippery slope. 
We may feel we are on a reasonable ground, with a reasonable goal, but down the slope there is irrationality, desperation, greed, self-hate, inferiority...
we tend to keep up with the Jones's. Many people compare with the wrong peer group .. including the web2.0 shops
We tend to neglect many valuable things that at end of our lives we would recognize as more important than the rat race

One of the jolting, awakening (一盆凉水) questions is - Granted other people earn a lot more, but i don't need that much money to live a comfortable life, so why do I feel inadequate so often?

I told many friends that I work hard to prepare for interviews but I am Very selective about where to join. 
I focus mostly on the salary level in the WallSt contract market, not the perm salaries. 
This kind of attitude is one small step towards a more rational, more pragmatic perception of the rat race

If I were in a high-cost location where typical household burn rate is 15k, then I would be under pressure to earn more just to keep up.

Like Black developers .. As an older Singaporean developer I also have higher visibility.
IFF I apply myself (localSys) and establish a foundation at a new site as Piroz does, I think I could survive and possibly show my hidden strengths.

However, at Stirt I was unable to outshine other guys.

At Macq, I was unable to impress bosses.

--I told Chris Ma my bias towards U.S. job market
* open-door policy towards graying techies
* lower stress, for multiple reasons
* plenty of jobs, at least in tristate area
* tech jobs are growing and we are in-demand, even at our age. I said we are both lucky. Chris said in the future there will be only IT jobs.
* my competitiveness among older techies
* decent contract rate
* market depth:
US tech salary very high, so even a mediocre tech job pays well above traditional jobs. Dev jobs pays even higher than regular tech jobs.

Gave me sense of security

--Retire at Google?
CSDoctor thinks it's possible but I doubt it
However CSDoctor questions himself "To present myself as a team lead or architect, what do I have to offer them?"

I think a large established firm (MLP, goog, AT&T) are more tolerant of "retirees"

--new paradox: if I feel basically semi-retired on my rental income, why do I envy those with higher income?

I feel I'm able to feel OK with conserver lifestyle, but my family members would not feel so comfortable. See my blog on deprivation.

Pattern: 
Suddenly I happen to notice a few "peers" getting ahead in terms of salary ... and I get hit by the same inferiority complex as before.
Actually, people 10 years younger are not my peers
Actually, the manager types aren't my peers, as grandpa pointed out repeatedly.

Q: what do I treasure more? I don't really need the 20% extra income. 
A: easy life -- PIP, stigma .. are real risks in my career.
A: beautiful wife
A: SG citizenship
A: wellness
A: cash flow freedom over 20Y or till end of my life
A: robust career. Their careers may not be so robust if you look closely

sg job market remains as slow and thin as before. Still financial jobs constitute 90% of my job pool
JC has more suitable jobs than SG has including start-up.

Singapore non-finance companies simply can't afford because the main street dev salary is much lower than U.S.

The wall st salary level is largely influenced by west coast and also main street dev salary. No such influence in SG
