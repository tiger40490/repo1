-- I spent money on robux to reduce his gaming time, but is it working?

family outing to reduce screen addiction. Cycling with dad is similar. watching a movie at home together could be counted as family time, and perhaps much better than "phone screen time".

try to reduce the (angry) outburst to a smaller flow. 

My discipline on meimei is looser than ah-boy, but it could be a good thing, as my strict confrontational stance /breeds/ anger. Anger breeds loss of control.

I tend to feel that the common advice and strategies won't help, but look at this case.

I am overly pessimistic about my son's judgement, self-control, risk of drug influence. His self-esteem and self-confidence may go lower because of my parenting attitude and manifestation through my words

Overprotective parenting -- against bad influence in U.S. youth culture. I tend to see my son as completely defenseless, lacking basic judgement.  I have a basically black/white view -- U.S. dangerous; SG safe. In fact, SG environment also has bad influences... When I came to SG from China I experienced lots of stress.

I need to accept the risk(s) of each choice I make. 

Counsellor pointed out the heavy PIP stress in my job would affect my parenting and therefore my kids!

Imagine a Chinese guy speaking broken English in Singapore or New York. Dismissed and discounted by everyone, but when it comes to driving, he is very skillful, because driving doesn't require Enlgish.

Another example is math, which doesn't require English skill. 

My son is not strong in theoretical domains, but he may prove his GTD abilities on a real job. Those who discount him would be surprise, perhaps upset.
