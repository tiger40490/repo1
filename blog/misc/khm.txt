--new: credit risk in my overseas investments
credit risk .. A single number is unable to capture the whole picture: 
In terms of the reputation at stake, Oxley is better
In terms of GRR trecï¼Œ MIH is slightly better.

The final stroke -- Grade-A being so rare, the reputation at stake is rather high. MIH as a small developer has big ambitions and puts its name into every building name.

I have trusted Megaworld, Oxley, Ritz, Delphi, AsiaProperty.
