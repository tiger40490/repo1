--fuxi jolt: Shanyou is deeply disappointed with his son's college -- lower branding relative to the peers
I (and my wife) am similarly disappointed with my son's benchmark performance.

--fuxi jolt: my renzi effort was huge but roti was .. small
.. but boy is now able to read a lot of Chinese books. Perhaps delayed compared to some kids, but much better than I feared, and miles ahead of U.S. kids.

The pleasant surprise was due to the school not me.

--fuxi jolt: I hoped that he would put up with practice to avoid more practice, but does anyone do that? Practice would be seen as a very negative experience.

--fuxi: the expert advice frowns upon all of the below
smashing is much safer than yelling or physical punishment

smacking the buttock is safer than throwing at a sibling

throwing soft toy is safer than throwing hard, heavy or sharp objects.

--fuxi jolt: Rahul's father (and Yinghui's father) always puts him down, becasue the kid is doing very well in school.

My son is lagging behind, so why I'm saying negative things? Because he doesn't care, and because I want him to feel the pain that I'm feeling.

--fuxi jolt: I may appear to be too harsh to boy compared to meimei.
I could defend myself saying that meimei is self-driven and shows absorbency, but to some observers (perhaps GP or boy himself), this may look like double-standard.

Need to be more harsh to meimei, but always with a valid reason.

I praise meimei more and more, but scold boy more and more !

-- fuxi: Cigna counselor chat
my anger towards boy is rather impulsive (irrational). I tend to attribute "all my pains" to this boy, when the real reason is my own reaction.

Remember DeepakG's words? 

The biggest risk is harm to him (also to myself), and to our bond. In a way, I need to always keep that risk in mind.

anger mgmt !

-- smacking and shouting

What would be a real sabotage of daddy's coaching effort? How about passive resistance?
How would a dicerning parent decide when to give up?

If not dicerning enough, then I would hit bitter contention, painful disappointment, wheel-spinning, self-hate, regretable ROTI, losing my cool

--fuxi: boy enjoys board game without being very good. but it is a better past time than screens
I was never good at any board game, 

--fuxi: should we remind him of the secondary school he picked?
Is he feeling any motivation? Perhaps non-zero
I need to be extremely careful not to turn it into negative motivation or ridicule

Q: $25 basketball paid too much?

The basketball buying experience is probably one of the defining experiences.
The main (perhaps implicit) message I sent across is -- If you are going to ????, then we can only spend a small amount. If you are going to keep this basketball for a long time, then we can spend a little more. 
I think he got the message, even though he may not use it frquently.
My estimate of that "frequency" is emotionally biased and unreliable.
Therefore, my answr to Q1 is also biased.

I too believe the first few versions of anything we buy are only for trying out. However in this case, we bought three previous versions -- way too high.

--fuxi: lost my cool. In hind sight, I did notice it and briefly considered leaving the scene but I felt that would be a defeat of a parent by a child!

Actually boy had already conceded once and agreed to listen to me showing him my method, but in the end he was "punished" as a result.... and feeling cheated.

I did raise my voice many times,,, a sign of losing my cool.

For a moment, I wanted to hit him or smash something (better than a smack),,, a sign of losing my cool.

Self-awareness is my key strength. Compared to other guys, I am better able to step out of myself and observe the person.

I need to recognize my limitation as a father and coach. One of the biggest limitations is losing my cool.
If and when I acknowledge my limitation, I should get help.

When hitting boy, it's important to have another parent present. Boy and I were both lucky that grandparents were around, to help maintain a balance, which is very much needed when I lose my cool but continue to engage in confrontational facetime.

Word problems with fractions are the toughest for boy. He would need to apply his mind and persevere

--fuxi
big idea -- behaviors that generate unpredicable rewards would quickly become habits.

This is at brain level, and proven in animals too.

--fuxi: boy experiences a lot of internal resistance to math practice esp pattern recog in wordy problems
I also experience the same with chin-up, stretching and coding drill

If no choice due to strict rule from dad, then not so much suffering and resistance.

Self-discipline without external help is harder.
