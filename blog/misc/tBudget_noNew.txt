--fuxi: t-efficiency at parenting
reading books -- efficient
blogging -- efficient
preparing worksheet -- efficient
outing -- extremely high t-cost
face time -- high t-cost and losing my cool

--fuxi (jolt): In terms of roti, yoga has less transient, more lasting benefits than most "endeavors" including most tech xx .. churn and fashion.

In contrast, software tech is like hairstyle -- what's dominant for the current decade is fashionable but not always techically superior.

--fuxi: compared to c++US days,
more time on boy -- far more than half my spare time
more distractions at home
more time talking to wife ... good. Was too little 
huge amount of time on family outing ... need to work on tcost and roti. 
less time on food preparation, thanks to maid + wife
less time on commute
more hours in office

--fuxi: One of the biggest challenges during this hibernation -- very few proven, effective usages of precious personal time including plenty of leaves
* (safe default) more time in office to capture the absorbency, extend the honeymoon
* weight management? demands time and absorbency, and frustrating
* more frq exercise
* c++ critical mass maintenance, but without IV :(
? boy's academics? frustrating,,, losing my cool
? per investment, esp. on Robinhood?

--fuxi:
My books on self-improvement, finance/economics knowledge, …. are not bearing fruits. Am not an intellectual as I was in my 20’s.

--fuxi: t-spend on BGC trip
dominated by meaningless sight-seeing and legwork.

I wanted 1) yoga 2) driving 3)work but only yoga took place

Tue I got up early and wanted to work, but was constantly preparing to go out for TIN legwork.

--fuxi:
"Let's walk around suntec for 30 minutes before the superpark" Sounds reasonable, but is likely (50% chance) to breed self-hate, guilt .. due to appalling roti

--fuxi: with boy on my bgc trip, I had to adjust my schedule for his meals etc. Huge waste of time.
I need to be firm -- stay home and spend my time more productively like reading, blogging, yoga

--fuxi:t-spend on laptop buy?
:) thinking/analysis was done in office, much better than on the go
:) I brought reading material to simlim
the 3-4 hours spent in simlim was kind of sight-seeing enjoyment. I found out that u.s. price is still lower but not a lot

--fuxi: 
i feel there's real conflict between my work honeymoon, parenting, yoga, early sleep, ...

Jolt: when i find myself in the honeymoon, I'd sleep late, take taxi home .. because the localSys absorbency is so precious. If I wait till next morning, I could lose it.

There's a huge emotional involvement in the math sessions with dabao, and I can lose my cool. Am not good at compartmentization

sacrificing work honeymoon ... for boy's math is questionable because
* Drive must come from within. Without it, we will be micro-managing, or driving with brake on
* risk of frustration ... missed punch
* risk of regret
* no proven method, so why keep investing precious resources into this unpromising, venture
* his job, not my job
* honeymoon is golden, precious, fleeting, 
* I decided long ago that I will only make time for him if he meets my conditions. Breaking my conditions is unwise and regretful. Tough!

Q (tough): boy is only asking me to help him do his homework not learning zbs. Is it good idea to sacrifice my work honeymoon?

now i can no longer afford to put 120% of my time into mlp (gtd, localSys...). 
* continue to strive towards early sleep, early rise
* continue to manage the call to grandparents
* work from home is ineffective, so if in the mood it is still a good idea to spend overtime in office
* perhaps reduce workout time

--fuxi: Q: if I follow Raymond's model and spend a lot of time with boy, then where would that time come from?
reduce blogging?
reduce outing?

Q: which past job would let me spend more time with boy? for a few months, not for years
OC is best
RTS boss was pushy, heartless and not considerate

Again, I feel it depends on coworker benchmark, localSys i.e. your brainpower vs brainpower baked into localSys... and other factors I may be missing .

--fuxi: working with boy on his problem sums is the least efficient item in my t-budget. 
A big red-flag item.
Need to control the tcost
I think a core issue is losing my cool
Once I lose my cool then better go to office

Overall, time spent coaching boy on his math has better roti than 
* watching TV/movie, 
* reading/watching news, 
* surfing, curiosity searching, 
* licai including huge t-spend on expense tracking, bx, and varioius account monitoring/analysis as a blackhole -- if I dig deeper I always find something I didn't know.
* micro-optimization on gadgets ...

--9 Nov I witnessed boy could read a Chinese story JiangXiaoYa fluently

--fuxi: seems very hard to "work" at home while managing boy's math drill. Problem is context switching tcost
Not ready to give up yet.

Bigger problem is losing my cool

Need to find the "killer app" to make it work
How about workout as a burn?
How about english blogging?
How about tech blog review/update?
... somehow I tend to demonize all of the above !

Coding drill is not strategic either ! Workout is more strategic

I can record the time usage over a few evenings and ask "how could we improve? What's a better profile?"

--nothing new. integrate with t_focus@GTD and the 'timeMgmt' category in open blog
Yoga eats into work and family time..requires a lot of time including commute, preparation, arriving in advance and trying to read/blog there, (or kicked out) 

my time at home is limited:
* household chores -- leave to maid if possible
* time for boy
* multiplication table with memmei
* non-tech blogging+emailing is a huge contender
* tech xx including QQ, zbs, coding ... i would probably give up.

My hours in office are scarce :
* tech xx including QQ -- need to cut further. Might be tough and need optimization
* GTD -- camp out if in the mood
* localSys explore -- for long term productivity etc
* frequent breaks
* phone call to BJ
