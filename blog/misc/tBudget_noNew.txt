the growing book/magazine/newspaper pile presented a /baggage/, an obligation.. 

luckily, my collection are mostly free. I think this is the most effective solution to this persistent concern. 
I want to tell myself to be less possessive, to travel light, to let go more readily

--fuxi: excessive blogg@@
part of my current comfortable ezlife is plenty of spare time for blogging. Satisfying, rewarding, but at the cost of tech xx pace, parenting, localSys

--fuxi: during circuit breaker, family distraction is now a full-blown assault
I feel frustrated and disappointed many times a day.

* hardware breakdowns
* questions on everything in the house
* heated discussions on boy's PSLE. Real stress real strain. Real risk of affecting my work
* health conditions 
* frequent conflicts with grandma
* degradation of wellness
* degradation of concentration during work hours
* i often feel the need to go home early. But I should capture the localSys mood

I thought grandparents could reduce my distraction stemming from boy's studies, but I think this distractions is actually worsening. I probably have no one to blame but myself.

-- fuxi: with cash flow, I constantly look out for ways to Reduce waste
with time usage, I constantly look out for ways to Increase productive use. 

Why the difference? You can't slow down or store the flow of time. You can only make better use (a bit more) of the 24H given to you each day.
 
--no blog: 
ERE Jacob pointed out that many early retirees have too much free time and not enough meaningful projects to occupy the free time. "Free from financial worries, but free to do ...."

That's not how I feel in my carefree life now.

Q: carefree? why am i still so short of time? not really carefree?
* parenting -- requires a huge amount of time? "Require" is the wrong word. Parenting sucks up unlimited amount of time, but the time is often not very productive. 
* BGC -- lots of decisions
* gold, additional bx -- can provide more cushion 
* stocks --
* critical mass maintenance --
* body-buiding -- 

As revealed to my sis, there's still livelihood anxiety under the surface.

-- no blog: per finance is possibly strategic but no absorbency required. therefore doesn't feel like burn

--fuxi: 
My G3 1stAid targets all require cognitive theraupy
1) PIP, damaged good
2) FOLB, slow track

--new: XR asked: so much free time what r u doing@@
if I focus my attention on XR's question about how I make use of my free time on the job, I would derive some awareness, some pain, but probably not a lot of motivatio to change.

If I have 4H/d freed up compared to past jobs, then 
1H spent on parenting
2H spent on blogging/emailing including investments such as overseas property
some hour spent on workout
some hour spent on DIY home improvement
less time spent on tech learning than before

my outing time with boy is still very very high, but better than P2 time when focus was on renzi. 2020 outing trips tend to be joint exercise.

In a way, I have no better usage of my increased spare time. The tech xx doesn't feel so satisfying. Blogging is the most satisfying, more than workout.

In Bayonne, I would spend it on workout, blogging, tech xx

--fuxi
when would I have time for 
* general nlg colorful, highly readable books about our body, transportation
* reduce the git-blog files

--fuxi: weekend roti target is important in my recent experience. 
Q: Is it possible that on some weekends I don't notice the low roti? 
A: Unlikely. The poor roti would inevitably become obvious and irratating, similar to money wasted.

In contrast, my weekday roti can also become very low but i do put in more effort... never as indulgent and lazy as on weekends

--fuxi jolt: family outing: extremely low roti,high tcost
The Cigna counsellors advocate family outing for stress relief and family bonding. I agree, but I don't think it is the most efficient. It is legitimate pleasure for sure. (Can we reduce it to once in two weeks? Just give some excuse like weather, appointments...)

In a way, people (average or high intelligence) save money exactly for pleasures such as family outing. I guess it's important to be aware of the tcost, although the awareness can create stress, guilt... 

Analogy -- I think before we enjoy a fancy meal, we need at least some awareness of the high $cost and BMI cost. Life is mostly about pain, duty, effort, livelihood,,, and much less about pleasure (享受).

My Safari experience is somewhat better. Food was a controlled indulgence. .. If I always say NO then family bonding may suffer.  Family bonding might be more important than career, investment, asset mgmt etc
--new: t-allocation: no need2earn more..
t_stress
See also stress-light days

some high flyers live under stress (including my style of constant study). 
Other high fliers (My sister? Rahul?) work hard and play harder.. usually big spenders. 

Nowadays I often feel I don't need to earn more so I want to increase the amount of (personal or family) time in peaceful leisure.

How about leisure reading? Pleasure but /decadent/indulgent/. 
How about social gathering, networking events? Not so enjoyable, and very time-consuming.
exercise, QQ, reflective blogging ... are much better.

--fuxi: spare time: now^c++US
jolt: compared to c++US days, I still have some non-trivial spare time.
I used to "burn" some of it on coding drill (2H/W), yoga(6H/W), workout etc

Now the 'burn' is (higher or lower) -- spent on parenting, household chores, (mini) workout, localSys, 

Managing the various enrichment programs -- is partly parenting, partly household duty

gadget management -- about 3 hours a week.

family outing -- is huge tcost. The time I could utilize for blogging or learning is very little. There's also the wrong-time temptation.

No wonder I have so little time left for tech xx. This analysis is valuable as it addresses the guilt, self-hate, sense of stagnation, lack of progress.

--fuxi: current guilty t-spends:
* read about covid19
* too much chitchat with grandpa -- often makes me feel blessed but also generates zsms
* shopping trip with boy, even though I buy healthy foods and builds bonding with boy
* git-blogging on MRT -- smart and efficient, but now I hate myself for doing this everyday.
* update wordpress from git-blogging -- more efficient than previously, but still zsms!
* research about SG vs other countries -- quite strategic!

Overall, I feel like missing the two ingredients of "burn"
1) self-discipline
2) materialistic ROTI

Remember I wanted tell the 10-year old tanbin "no one is that strong. Everyone is weak and helpless and deserve punishment/ridicule for being weak." This zsms (and self-hate) is based on exorbitant expectations of self-discipline, martyrdom and self-mastery. The standard is based on an unrealistic concept of weaknesss vs strength. More often, the expectation is based on peer comparison and benchmarking.

The yardstick is relative (to peers) not absolute. By absolute standard, I have ffree and ought to enjoy my carefree life so I don't need to work hard on any front except wellness !

So after "pushing" myself with half the strength for a few months after Cambodia trip, I now notice the cumulative effect of the half-effort. Now I no longer allow myself to stay this "low". However, in fact, during this "low" period, 
* I did lots of CIV with friends
* I wrapped up both MIH and BGC investments
* I helped boy on math, and engaged YoungProdigy. I repaired the bonding with quality facetime more than once
* I did huge amount of jogging
* I was able to get up early on most days
* I continued my diet in terms of starch, raw veg, fruits, 

All of the above were somehow dismissed. In this perception, I ignore or discount those and other observable/realized gains in wellness, family bonding, ,,, due to the "burn" factors above.

--no blog: I'm tuned in to myself. I think the current driver is spare time utilization, or the zsms thereof.
Burn/rot is mostly materialistic pursuit + self-discipline ... martyrdom?

In the typical weekend, median hours spent on 'burn' is about 2 hour such as tech xx, localSys, workout or academic coaching
In the most 'burn' weekend, I can hit 10-20 hour, never 40 hours
This weekend I have achieved
* gate skirt -- lots of time, research, tweaking, and courage in the face of uncertainty.
* math coaching incl meimei
* friday jogging , chin-up
* diet control

To satisfy that driver (and that judge) I push myself to jogging or office

cognitive sms-therapy: 
I need to drive home the sms "the gate fixture has big impact on family wellbeing". No hurry and I don't want to hire a contractor just for it. 
I have spare time so this is a good use of my spare time.
I can derive a bit of joy

What's strategic -- 
localsys? No
stretch? Yes but no power surge in that space
coach my son on wordy problems? No 
coach my son on self-discipline and confidence? possibly

--fuxi: when overloaded with commitments in investment, parenting,,,

* mlp project
* help boy with math -- stressful, fearful of anxiety. Better postpone to when both of us are in better mood
* bgc title -- no real urgency. need to slow down
* tax filing and hrblock fee payment (from citibank)? no real hurry
* starhub bill -- can check later; will create stress

Go to office and work a bit but take leaves, to avoid stress/guilt and sleep deprivation -> immune system under strain

I should consider taking half-day leaves, and spend many hours blogging to bring back the much-needed clarity 

Many people spend office hours on those personal commitments. UnWise?

If busy with projects, those Projects might be affected (worst case -- overlooked). Even if you are skillful to avoid any impact, the juggling is likely to create stress.

If not busy at work, then I tend to feel guilty for taking advantage of employer

--fuxi: 
I used to consider my social engagements low efficiency -- missing both ingredients of "burn"

Well, some of those hot-burn items turned out not so effective after all:
eg: QQ
eg: coding drill
eg: renzi training

--fuxi: 
for tech, most people read too fast without enough cross-reference and review as I do.
For gz, I don't find the reading very relevant. 

for investment, perhaps I read too little and blog too much?

for parenting, perhaps I read and blog too little and discuss too much. Parenting is mostly self-education, self-discovery, self-coaching

--fuxi: t-efficiency at parenting
reading books -- efficient
blogging -- efficient
preparing worksheet -- efficient
outing -- extremely high t-cost
face time -- high t-cost and losing my cool

--fuxi (jolt): In terms of roti, yoga has less transient, more lasting benefits than most "endeavors" including most tech xx .. churn and fashion.

In contrast, software tech is like hairstyle -- what's dominant for the current decade is fashionable but not always techically superior.

--fuxi: compared to c++US days,
more time on boy -- far more than half my spare time
more distractions at home
more time talking to wife ... good. Was too little 
huge amount of time on family outing ... need to work on tcost and roti. 
less time on food preparation, thanks to maid + wife
less time on commute
more hours in office

--fuxi: One of the biggest challenges during this hibernation -- very few proven, effective usages of precious personal time including plenty of leaves
* (safe default) more time in office to capture the absorbency, extend the honeymoon
* weight management? demands time and absorbency, and frustrating
* more frq exercise
* c++ critical mass maintenance, but without IV :(
? boy's academics? frustrating,,, losing my cool
? per investment, esp. on Robinhood?

--fuxi:
My books on self-improvement, finance/economics knowledge, …. are not bearing fruits. Am not an intellectual as I was in my 20’s.

--fuxi: t-spend on BGC trip
dominated by meaningless sight-seeing and legwork.

I wanted 1) yoga 2) driving 3)work but only yoga took place

Tue I got up early and wanted to work, but was constantly preparing to go out for TIN legwork.

--fuxi:
"Let's walk around suntec for 30 minutes before the superpark" Sounds reasonable, but is likely (50% chance) to breed self-hate, guilt .. due to appalling roti

--fuxi: with boy on my bgc trip, I had to adjust my schedule for his meals etc. Huge waste of time.
I need to be firm -- stay home and spend my time more productively like reading, blogging, yoga

--fuxi:t-spend on laptop buy?
:) thinking/analysis was done in office, much better than on the go
:) I brought reading material to simlim
the 3-4 hours spent in simlim was kind of sight-seeing enjoyment. I found out that u.s. price is still lower but not a lot

--fuxi: 
i feel there's real conflict between my work honeymoon, parenting, yoga, early sleep, ...

Jolt: when i find myself in the honeymoon, I'd sleep late, take taxi home .. because the localSys absorbency is so precious. If I wait till next morning, I could lose it.

There's a huge emotional involvement in the math sessions with dabao, and I can lose my cool. Am not good at compartmentization

sacrificing work honeymoon ... for boy's math is questionable because
* Drive must come from within. Without it, we will be micro-managing, or driving with brake on
* risk of frustration ... missed punch
* risk of regret
* no proven method, so why keep investing precious resources into this unpromising, venture
* his job, not my job
* honeymoon is golden, precious, fleeting, 
* I decided long ago that I will only make time for him if he meets my conditions. Breaking my conditions is unwise and regretful. Tough!

Q (tough): boy is only asking me to help him do his homework not learning zbs. Is it good idea to sacrifice my work honeymoon?

now i can no longer afford to put 120% of my time into mlp (gtd, localSys...). 
* continue to strive towards early sleep, early rise
* continue to manage the call to grandparents
* work from home is ineffective, so if in the mood it is still a good idea to spend overtime in office
* perhaps reduce workout time

--fuxi: Q: if I follow Raymond's model and spend a lot of time with meimei, then where would that time come from?
reduce blogging?
reduce outing?

Q: which past job would let me spend more time with kids? for a few months, not for years
OC is best
RTS boss was pushy, heartless and not considerate

Again, I feel it depends on coworker benchmark, localSys i.e. your brainpower vs brainpower baked into localSys... and other factors I may be missing .

--fuxi: working with boy on his problem sums is the least efficient item in my t-budget. 
A big red-flag item.
Need to control the tcost
I think a core issue is losing my cool
Once I lose my cool then better go to office

Overall, time spent coaching boy on his math has better roti than 
* watching TV/movie, 
* reading/watching news, 
* surfing, curiosity searching, 
* licai including huge t-spend on expense tracking, bx, and varioius account monitoring/analysis as a blackhole -- if I dig deeper I always find something I didn't know.
* micro-optimization on gadgets ...

--fuxi Feb24: seems very hard to "work" at home while managing boy's math drill. Problem is context switching tcost
Not ready to give up yet.

Bigger problem is losing my cool

Need to find the "killer app" to make it work
How about workout as a burn?
How about english blogging?
How about tech blog review/update?
... somehow I tend to demonize all of the above !

--nothing new. integrate with t_focus@GTD and the 'timeMgmt' category in open blog
Yoga eats into work and family time..requires a lot of time including commute, preparation, arriving in advance and trying to read/blog there, (or kicked out) 

my time at home is limited:
* household chores -- leave to maid if possible
* time for boy
* multiplication table with memmei
* non-tech blogging+emailing is a huge contender
* tech xx including QQ, zbs, coding ... i would probably give up.

My hours in office are scarce :
* tech xx including QQ -- need to cut further. Might be tough and need optimization
* GTD -- camp out if in the mood
* localSys explore -- for long term productivity etc
* frequent breaks
* phone call to BJ
