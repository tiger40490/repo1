In any domain, the U.S. tends to produce large numbers of influential figures (considering the U.S. population), much higher than BRIC countries.

However, a much larger number of Americans struggle against livelihood, often falling into hardship temporarily or indefinitely.

What's a simple yardstick for hardship and struggle? Perhaps the WBank's international poverty line?

Singapore is very different. The poor are outnumbered by the wen1bao3 class. Therefore, the government can more easily take care of them. If you look at the number of influential individuals, Singapore's talent pool is not outstanding.

(Most people don't have such a choice, but for those who have) what's your personal goal in choosing a country? Sg is a good choice if you want a comprehensive safety net, and vulnerable protection[kids, elderly, displaced].

U.S. is good if you have aspirations and want to make a name for yourself. 

Image, reputation, credibility, competitive strength is dominated by influential figures, therefore the U.S. ranks top in most domains. That helps the U.S. attract global talents, and stay on top.
