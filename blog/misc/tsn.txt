--new blogpost: tsn: elusive^achievable gains
[tags t_othRisk, t_framework]
when I tsn, i aim at multiple target 'gains' as in a pyramid
strategic value is the most elusive, comparable to HuKun taking his brother as role model. More strategic is my rental property investment
salary hike is one of the least likely [CVA]
i hope to open up new job markets at similar pay. I enjoy wider range of oppo and being in-demand
.. but what if the new "market" is unsuitable?
i hope to broaden my capability-base incl dnlg. 
I don't want all my eggs in one basket... hedging
.. but the broad base may not be so relevant
i hope to build my self-confidence about learning
.. but sometimes not much self-confidence boost
i hope to keep my mind active and engaged, rather than doing the same boring job over 5Y

(Not really about tsn) i also want to strengthen my position, extend my lead on the body-building race. This effort takes huge amount of energy

if all else fail, i hope to avoid waste my precious spare time - burn/rot

My thick->thin insight into c#, SQL, swing, quant ... are not needed at present. Future? How about my current heavy t-investment in socket, TMP, c++11...?

Focus today is ROTI, NOT about churn. Socket, SQL, core c++ are actually the best-performing tech bets in terms of robust demand and shelf-life. 

If you stay within core java (like XR and many friends), then you don't need to learn these other skills, but are they better off now? Diminishing return in ROTI?

I think it's impossibly hard to keep keep up ROTI. I can aim for accu, thick->thin, cross-pollination, churn resistance, sustained focus, traction, engaging, ... but ROTI is still underwhelming.

ROTI is a huge "deflator" of my enthusiasm, motivation, absorbency.. I think I need rational expectations.

Among the biggest 10 branching out (tsn) from java/SQL/perl , I still favor c++/socket/py/mktData.

--  no blogpost: long-term orgro=elusive
long-term orgro is elusive. Biggest success I can think of is c++ (thanks to lots of IV) but in terms of salary increasae, I can't think of any... perhaps quant dev

swing -- rare engagement + orgro, thick->thin but abandoned !

c# -- i made sacrifices for deep-dive, and in return experienced rare engagement + orgro + thick->thin. I have since given up the direction, as c# is not so relevant to my current direction.
