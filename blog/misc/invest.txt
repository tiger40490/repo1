--new blogpost: %%peers' burn rate: y higher
I discussed with grandpa about a huge difference between me and my colleagues' burn rates. 
This difference is rooted in their long-term optimism about their earning growth and stock market returns. 

(In contrast, my self-confidence about my salary sustainability is based on IV.)

One thing easy and really useful to do with money matters is break-down analysis. 
I can see my younger (and some in 40's) colleagues spending more on food, rent, mortgage, car, vacations, entertainment, gadgets, kids' enrichment .. 
These are often big-ticket items or creature-comfort spending and clearly luxury IMO

Many believe food is never a big ticket item, but I think they spend $40/D i.e. $15k/Y vs my 4k/Y.

Note I can't (allow myself to) cut further down below my peers because my family would then feel deprived.
