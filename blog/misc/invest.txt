--new blogpost: %%peers' burn rate: y higher
I discussed with grandpa about a huge difference between me and my colleagues' burn rates. 
This difference is rooted in their long-term optimism about their earning growth and stock market returns. 

(In contrast, my self-confidence about my salary sustainability is based on IV.)

One thing easy and really useful to do with money matters is break-down analysis. 
I can see my younger (and some 40's) colleagues spending more on food, rent, mortgage, car, vacations, entertainment, gadgets, kids' enrichment .. 
These are big-ticket items or creature-comfort spending and clearly luxury IMO

Note I can't (allow myself to) cut further down below my peers because my family would then feel the deprivation.

Will reconsider maid. Luxury but might free up lots of precious time.

AsiaPropertyDev has  current campaign to pay 20% in Y1, 21% in Y2 ... 24% in Y5 if client commits 50k. Last payment is 50k * 1.24.

I told Jill this contractual return is too high and a sign of desperation but Jill said CEO adjusts campaign features constantly.

I shared with Jill my observation -- once a while a reputble company disrupts a mature market with drastically reduced cost to customers and captures huge market share
* fsm
* vanguard
* robinhood
* quality free software with source code
* yoga classes offered free or at 9 classes/$32

--review (not constantly distracted by) the stocks I bought?
* look for declines and buy more. perhaps focus on up to 10 known brands.
* evaluate dividend received vs price adjustment? tbudget = 0
xp: FSM funds are a distraction

--fuxi: sheild prem increase
Colin Tan said my low-end plan premium went up by a few percent (vs 50% hike for the private-hospital plans)

If you don't want the hike, then go for the 95% coverage
