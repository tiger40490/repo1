--new blogpost: backyard usage
Q: given a backyard, what usages do I find valuable?

swimming? too small
basketball? no fun

Many of these usages require expensive set-up, not worth it if used lightly

--new blogpost: %%peers' burn rate: y higher
I discussed with grandpa about a huge difference between me and my colleagues' burn rates. 
This difference is rooted in their long-term optimism about their earning growth and stock market returns. 

(In contrast, my self-confidence about my salary sustainability is based on IV.)

One thing easy and really useful to do with money matters is break-down analysis. 
I can see my younger (and some in 40's) colleagues spending more on food, rent, mortgage, car, vacations, entertainment, gadgets, kids' enrichment .. 
These are often big-ticket items or creature-comfort spending and clearly luxury IMO

Many believe food is never a big ticket item, but I think they spend $40/D i.e. $15k/Y vs my 4k/Y.

Note I can't (allow myself to) cut further down below my peers because my family would then feel the deprivation.

Will reconsider maid. Luxury but might free up lots of precious time.

--review (not constantly distracted by) the stocks I bought?
* look for declines and buy more. perhaps focus on up to 10 known brands.
* evaluate dividend received vs price adjustment? tbudget = 0
xp: FSM funds are a distraction

--fuxi: shield prem increase
Colin Tan said my low-end plan premium went up by a few percent (vs 50% hike for the private-hospital plans)

If you don't want the hike, then go for the 95% coverage
