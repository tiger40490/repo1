-- this weekend need to transfer the monthly allowance to wife

--Q: my predicted burn rate with maid? 7k
Q: is it even constructive to set a target?
I usually need (and benefit from) certainty, control, clarity ... --> assurance and confidence, but it can take a lot of effort (I ended up doing it twice a year) and generate some stress.

--rename this to ... cashflow.txt?

--too much SGD or USD?
After we relocate to U.S. we will have some SGD reserve, growing thanks to HDB rental income. What use do we have for this growing pile of SGD? 
* perhaps as wife's reserve. I think she prefers SGD
* perhaps to top up CPF 
* Perhaps to hedge against USD devaluation. 
* Perhaps convert to USD to invest in US or Asia.
* put my surplus SGD into CPF-life at age 55.

Until the relocation, I think my USD would be in surplus. 

Any property big buy is likely in USD, but unlikely in SG 

However, when USD is on the rise, I have a chance to gain "access" to it by converting to SGD. Worst case it goes up further and never comes down, so i would invest into cpf-life

Leaving USD bank notes at home is a constant worry and stressor

--fuxi: ocbc 
young saver's account will have min balance only when meimei reaches 18

for ATM access, i will put my own money, not kid's money in this account.. Same as mayb. Alternatively, I can make do without ATM access.

--Q: what's the best use of additional 100k?
Some will actually spend it on fancy vacations
some will actually save it up to support top school districts or educational programs
I will consider
* lower-paying job with more satisfaction
* more time with grandparents

--new
Many fellow parents (plan to) spend so much on their kids because .. they want-to not pressured-to. Chinese parents feel good about martyrdom -- saving up and spending it on kids education. 

Labor of love... However, Some (33 to 50%) of my peers appear to be under pressure to spend such huge amounts, due to peer pressure and societal expectation like a "norm".

How am I different?
I don't plan to spend on branded college, so there's a 50/50 chance I won't start saving until 4Y before college
I don't want to spend on luxury vacations as an "education" -- unnecessary and too costly
I do consider taking lower jobs to spend more time with kids.
I plan to spend on kids' non-academic pursuits, as Jenny on swimming

====update blogpost on 
Again, why my peers don't feel ffree
* For their USD 90k burn rate with employer-sponsored health benefit, at 4% reliable return, they need 2.25M invested.
* For my SGD 40k burn rate with medishield, at 6% rental yield, I only need SGD 700k invested

My advantages are 1) burn rate 2) yield

--Let's look at their burn rate:

I discussed with grandpa about a huge difference between me and my colleagues' burn rates. 
This difference is rooted in their long-term optimism about their earning growth and stock market returns. 

(In contrast, my self-confidence about my salary sustainability is based on IV.)

One thing easy and really useful to do with money matters is break-down analysis. 
I can see my younger (and some in 40's) colleagues spending more than I do on food, rent, mortgage, car, vacations, entertainment, gadgets, kids' enrichment .. 
These are often big-ticket items or creature-comfort spending, and clearly luxury IMO

Many believe food is never a big ticket item, but I think they spend $40/D i.e. $15k/Y vs my 4k/Y.

Note I can't (allow myself to) cut further down below my peers because my family could then feel deprived.
