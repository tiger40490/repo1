-- update .. 
(updating an existing blogpost will take longer)
Through my late 40's to 50, in which technial domain will I maintain my competitive high ground?

core Java language? Remarkably stable
xLang concurrency
xLang dStruct
perl? Unfortunately perl6 has moved
drv pricing + bond math [Type1 dnlg] ? Yes because programmers don't study the math
byte-level parsing
WallSt architecture [Type3 dnlg]

--fuxi informal feedbacks during year-end party
"You are process oriented, which is missing in the local team. We are not used to so many questions so we ignored some of your questions. We assume each team member has maturity and needs only a pointer and can figure out the rest." In zed I used to feel the same about asking questions, but in GS it all changed. 

* Gary -- needs to speak out. Not taking initiative to show leadership.
* Anurag -- very sharp guy, but i think he is fast at the expense of quality. Nevertheless, he is probably very sharp.

It's really dangerous to openly talk about other team members in front of other people whom we may not know so well.
These 2 guys are sophisticated but I think their habit is quite reckless. 
However, if we don't take this opportunity now, then we may not know how we think of each other.

I was rather bold when talking about Anurag in public. I think that might be the first unsafe comment of the night.

-- fuxi: c++ displaced [C, cobol, Delphi, VB...] before java diplaced c++. Now java market share is eroded by js, py, go-lang etc.
losing to py in data-centric systems.
losing to js in web apps. Many features are moving from server side to client side. 
-- update: java is better...
After java5, the core lang is now more stable than c++ in terms of IV topics

Even though jxee job market is volatile, the coreJava niche job market enjoys robust demand.

My strength in low-level details is far more valuable in java than py, perl, SQL etc.

compared to c++, cdd/job ratio is not very different, but the java cdd pool is low-calibre. In coreJava, I can easily stand out.
--fuxi: wq.l felt govtech is not a technology laggard. He is attracted by that and the job stability. 
Work load is not lighter than elsewhere in his experience. However, I would say many private employers are more aggressive more pushing more ruthless.

Is age a problem? wq.l felt yes because the younger developers have more flexibility in salary requirement. However, I feel the younger dev also has an expectation of rising income. Any signs any evidence that "My career may not be as promising as thought, not growing as fast as my cohort" tend to be devastating. In other words, the older dev is allowed to be slower, mediocre, more low-energy (as I told Sachin).

-- fuxi: IT consulting service offered by mgmt consulting firms ... is facing competition from the original vendors providing similar consulting services.
Advantage to the former: multi-product offering. 
Once a client decides to go with a single vendor, they could let go the consulting firm. 

-- fuxi: The CoreData presentation introduced many new technologies in data management , including elastic cloud, data warehouse, ETL, MOM, noSQL ..  

These domains suffer high churn. Luckily, I didn't join Ab-initio. I think in these job interviews, there's no coding or low-level QQ quizzes, but probably lots of tool knowlege required. I recall the spring/hibernate interviews. If you acquire lots of tool knowledge, you will still lose the coding or QQ interviews.

java is relevant to all of them.
python is relevant to many of them.
C# is less prevalent.
C/c++ is too low-level, not associated with these high-level tools.

I actively stay away from high-churn technologies (languages) such as javascript, GO, Spark, Spring, NoSql, XML, Json

In my first 5 programming years I embraced the newest languages perl/php/javascript simply because I needed to cast my net wide. Slowly I gravitated towards mature, over-the-peak technologies like SQL, Unix, C, socket.

new languages claim to displace perl, java, c/c++ etc, but time will tell a different story. 
C# didn't dethrone java; python didn't completely eliminate perl; c is still widely used.

noSql claims to displace RDBMS, but time will tell a different story.

Mostly U.S. firms. Web2.0 and HFT. I think they benchmark with U.S. wage levels.

Chinese web2.0 shops (bytedance > tencent > shopee) can pay $7k/M to .. new (or recent) graduates before you negotiate for even higher.

--new: critical mass on socket IV
I have a bit of critical mass on socket IV.

Those writing networking/socket programs outside C are on the peripheral/sideline. Those programming languages depend on the C API. C++ class/template libraries are in a similar situation. All of them are too high-level.

Therefore, I believe my past socket QQ interview questions are alien to those high-level candidates.

-- fuxi: refresh on localSys^QQ^nontech-blog
limited memory capacity, unable to hold everything in L1 cache. Some content must fetch from disk.

Most people who claim an expertise do have some expertise, even if exaggerated slightly. Most audience won't bother to verify the credentials.

My UChicago GPA is 100% authentic. In a fast-moving market, credibility and assurance from known-brands matter. Probably needed it in a declining phase of my career. It's insurance protection for my career.

My java/c++ QQ knowledge is not advanced expertise, but is enough to pass many external benchmarks.

They speak a shrewd, politically correct yet insightful language. In contrast, I speak my plain, long-winded, foolhardy language, sometimes without thinking too much. Remember my exchange with LSAgain? In the end, I have survived on my tech IV skills. Some of these guys move up, gain OC-effectiveness, but who cares about those things?

For 3 jobs I postponed my start date

* Qz -- to maximize the most relaxing phase of any job
* Macq -- to extend the job hunt (on bench) after securing an offer. I was already in good shape for c++ interviews in SG.
* MLP -- Similar to Macq case, but not on bench. Before I secured the MLP offer, I had created a valuable momentum and peak absorbency for coding drill.

This write-up is too vague at this stage.

Writing work emails, I often feel unsure of the nuances and potential reactions (ever so subtle) in the recipients. Work email etiquette is too numerous, too nuanced for me.

Actully this 'unsure' feeling might be a sign of my sensitivity and maturity.

Some of my so-called peers are much more confident about these nuances. They write quick, informal, barely acceptable English sentences, sometimes too short sometimes too lengthy. But they are confident there's nothing offending. They are often managers. I often feel inferior to them.

Actually written communication is still my relative strength compared to spoken communication. My weakness is more severe in spoken communications since I have very little time to react, to process the message I send across.

Sometims everyone has very little time to react, but most people are more natural more confident than I am.

For all my career esp. after 35, my competitive strengths in theoretical + details are evergreen and vital advantages in tech IV.

I tend to look up towards U.S. and HK as high-income countries. Here's my critical assessment
* for inet tech professionals: Yes U.S. (not HK) is much higher than SG, but BR is also higher, so brbr is unclear.
* for WallSt techies: Yes U.S. and HK are higher-income than SG and offer many more jobs, but BR is higher. Brbr is probably inferior to SG.
* for main street techies: U.S. (not HK) is higher-income than SG, but BR is higher. Brbr is unclear.

for many peers (LS, Sunil, CNA...), the main goal is higher income but for me dev-till-70 is more valuable.

Contract job market is better for me not THEM.

Core java is one of the best tech domains. I can stick to java (keeping c++ critical mass). THEY may need to accept some corporate technology stack like cloud or Qz or data analytics.

Tech IV skills (coding drill and QQ) are absolutely essential to me not THEM.
They only need to pass IV once a while, and try to stay in one job for years. 
If tech IV and competing with youngsters is a painful process for them, then they would not keep practicing.

-- fuxi: back to home town like a king
LS once shared his view that at the same salary (say, 200k) in the U.S. he would be somewhat affluent, but in China he would be super rich in comparison with his /fellow countrymen/. I guess this is a fundamental (therefore powerful) motivator for some people in my circle.

As a less extreme but more widespread case, the covid19 economic fallout puts some tech workers in an enviable position relative to their fellow countrymen.

Q: is it intrinsic or extrinsic motivation? Not sureQ: how is FOMO related? I think in U.S. he would feel the FOMO fear but in China he would be the target of envy.

Why I bother with this question? Because this is a subtle factor in my choice of the country for my family

.. BGC and Cambodia experiences:
For a few days I did live like such a king, but the feeling was not really satisfying.

.. brbr: To me, when comparing U.S. vs "lower" countries, BRBR is more important than this factor.

--fuxi: threading is a core IV topic in java, but remain a "superstructure" topic in c++, in the form of c++11 thread and pthreads.

I think java threading is simpler and accessible to regular app developers whereas c++ threading remains part of the vast array of advanced topics.

I think my progress in my c++ QQ IV since 2011 was mostly in the core QQ topics. I achieved some thick->thin and critical mass.

--fuxi: microsoft acquired Mono project and produced dotnet core (Sunil) as a jvm challenger to run on non-windows platforms

I think mono project may be better off as independent but endorsed by Microsoft

--fuxi: oth: system architect career path that Qihao described 
I'm biased against such a career path. I think some interviewers expect the contractor to bring valuable experience to the table and propose solutions (to be decided by the app owner)

Q: was I able to play that role? 
A: I think Josh actually felt I was able to. I think that was at a micro level, but I might be able to at higher level as well.

A: I think Venkat and Shubin actually noticed it 

I think Yang, Chad... were more successful doing this, though I didn't like Yang's java solutions. 

I probably have a blogpost on my past record. Overall, I think this "promise" is not easy to deliver. My track record was mixed.

In recent jobs, I have not been very keen, determined to overcome the challenges and propose new ideas. To score a point, I don't really need to get it implemented. 

I feel at Mvea I lost the initial drive.

--fuxi: plowback into c++
After my java conquest, I decided to avoid build-up to jxee. I decided to deepen and branch-out to c++.

I believed the stability of c++ would favor older coders like me, but now I feel c++ is mostly chosen by HFT i.e. type2. 
The type1/type3 WallSt c++ shops represent roughly half the market and (yes!) provided some small ROI.

c++ did help my coreJava QQ.

c++ did strengthen my profile and confidence at web2.0 interviews, as coreJava isn't so dominant therein.

Overall, the plowback is effective but underwhelming. 
It would be more effective where coreJava is less dominant, as in web2.0 and microsoft shops.

As soon as we start to work towards better salary , we are on a slippery slope. 
We may feel we are on a reasonable ground, with a reasonable goal, but down the slope there is irrationality, desperation, greed, self-hate, inferiority...
we tend to keep up with the Jones's. Many people compare with the wrong peer group .. including the web2.0 shops
We tend to neglect many valuable things that at end of our lives we would recognize as more important than the rat race

One of the jolting, awakening (一盆凉水) questions is - Granted other people earn a lot more, but i don't need that much money to live a comfortable life, so why do I feel inadequate so often?

I told many friends that I work hard to prepare for interviews but I am Very selective about where to join. 
I focus mostly on the salary level in the WallSt contract market, not the perm salaries. 
This kind of attitude is one small step towards a more rational, more pragmatic perception of the rat race
