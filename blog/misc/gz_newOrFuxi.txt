* boss approval ? still important
* bonus amount? LG2
* commute? LG2
* Y-junction neglect due to work stress? LG2
* good sleep? important
* career longevity? important
** dnlg-math? important only for job IV moat over the long term
** in contrast, salary now is secondary
* opportunity to collaborate with US/EU? important
* opportunity to work on weekends? important

The spectacular office building and view, and the jogging path nearby generates stress rather than relief.

--new: critical mass on socket IV
I have a bit of critical mass on socket IV.

Those writing networking/socket programs outside C are on the peripheral/sideline. Those programming languages depend on the C API. C++ class/template libraries are in a similar situation. All of them are too high-level.

Therefore, I believe my past socket QQ interview questions are alien to those high-level candidates.

-- fuxi: refresh on localSys^QQ^nontech-blog
limited memory capacity, unable to hold everything in L1 cache. Some content must fetch from disk.

* top 200 of the nontech blogposts in recrec -- refresh is time-consuming
* QQ, CIV pearls -- (about 50% in blog) need to focus on the evergreen, xref and thick->thin
** learn new pearls? LGlp unless it gets linked in via xref. 
* localSys -- I never really allocate enough time on refresh. Maybe I should.

--fuxi: common reasons against moving to U.S. in their mid-30s
These deep, real reasons help me understand my position, my SWOT

..they need to rebuild a career, because U.S. doesn't recognize Singapore experience.
In a way, my move to web2.0 would be similiar.

..The promised good jobs in U.S. may not be available to them.
Competitive interviews.

..uncertainty and risk, vs stable, secure current job in SG
..racial discrimination
..immigration complications

Most people who claim an expertise do have some expertise, even if exaggerated slightly. Most audience won't bother to verify the credentials.

My UChicago GPA is 100% authentic. In a fast-moving market, credibility and assurance from known-brands matter. Probably needed it in a declining phase of my career. It's insurance protection for my career.

My java/c++ QQ knowledge is not advanced expertise, but is enough to pass many external benchmarks.

remote coding test is unauthenticated and never more than a screening test, not a ranking test to rank candidates.

Ranking always requires face-to-face interview.

-- no blog: in the zoom seminar on receiving feedback, the 5 active participants are all the same types
* eloquent
** my English might be slightly better
* shrewd
* somewhat ambitious moving up to a more senior or more lucrative position in the same team.
** am OK with no bonus no raise, and AVP job title iff secure

They speak a shrewd, politically correct yet insightful language. In contrast, I speak my plain, long-winded, foolhardy language, sometimes without thinking too much. Remember my exchange with LSAgain? In the end, I have survived on my tech IV skills. Some of these guys move up, gain OC-effectiveness, but who cares about those things?

For 3 jobs I postponed my start date

* Qz -- to maximize the most relaxing phase of any job
* Macq -- to extend the job hunt (on bench) after securing an offer. I was already in good shape for c++ interviews in SG.
* MLP -- Similar to Macq case, but not on bench. Before I secured the MLP offer, I had created a valuable momentum and peak absorbency for coding drill.

This write-up is too vague at this stage.

Writing work emails, I often feel unsure of the nuances and potential reactions (ever so subtle) in the recipients. Work email etiquette is too numerous, too nuanced for me.

Actully this 'unsure' feeling might be a sign of my sensitivity and maturity.

Some of my so-called peers are much more confident about these nuances. They write quick, informal, barely acceptable English sentences, sometimes too short sometimes too lengthy. But they are confident there's nothing offending. They are often managers. I often feel inferior to them.

Actually written communication is still my relative strength compared to spoken communication. My weakness is more severe in spoken communications since I have very little time to react, to process the message I send across.

Sometims everyone has very little time to react, but most people are more natural more confident than I am.

jGC knowledge is high-churn. The insight and halo you build loses value over 10 years.

--fuxi: untitled
For all my career esp. after 35, my competitive strengths in theoretical + details are evergreen and vital advantages in tech IV.

Performance (including bigO, but excluding field turning) is all about details.

In contrast, speed coding is less of "my game". It is like a sprint race for a footballer.

--new: envious of U.S. superior income
I tend to look up towards U.S. and HK as high-income countries. Here's my critical assessment
* for inet tech professionals: Yes U.S. (not HK) is much higher than SG, but BR is also higher, so brbr is unclear.
* for WallSt techies: Yes U.S. and HK are higher-income than SG and offer many more jobs, but BR is higher. Brbr is probably inferior to SG.
* for main street techies: U.S. (not HK) is higher-income than SG, but BR is higher. Brbr is unclear.

However, there are many other factors such as social safety net, job opportunities, edu options,

--new: untitled
for many peers (LS, Sunil, CNA...), the main goal is higher income but for me dev-till-70 is more valuable.

Contract job market is better for me not THEM.

Core java is one of the best tech domains. I can stick to java (keeping c++ critical mass). THEY may need to accept some corporate technology stack like cloud or Qz or data analytics.

Tech IV skills (coding drill and QQ) are absolutely essential to me not THEM.
They only need to pass IV once a while, and try to stay in one job for years. 
If tech IV and competing with youngsters is a painful process for them, then they would not keep practicing.

-- fuxi: back to home town like a king
LS once shared his view that at the same salary (say, 200k) in the U.S. he would be somewhat affluent, but in China he would be super rich in comparison with his /fellow countrymen/. I guess this is a fundamental (therefore powerful) motivator for some people in my circle.

As a less extreme but more widespread case, the covid19 economic fallout puts some tech workers in an enviable position relative to their fellow countrymen.

Q: is it intrinsic or extrinsic motivation? Not sureQ: how is FOMO related? I think in U.S. he would feel the FOMO fear but in China he would be the target of envy.

Why I bother with this question? Because this is a subtle factor in my choice of the country for my family

.. BGC and Cambodia experiences:
For a few days I did live like such a king, but the feeling was not really satisfying.

.. brbr: To me, when comparing U.S. vs "lower" countries, BRBR is more important than this factor.

I had open conflicts with managers in SCS, VZ, GS, albeit mild conflicts in Barcap

--fuxi: threading is a core IV topic in java, but remain a "superstructure" topic in c++, in the form of c++11 thread and pthreads.

I think java threading is simpler and accessible to regular app developers whereas c++ threading remains part of the vast array of advanced topics.

I think my progress in my c++ QQ IV since 2011 was mostly in the core QQ topics. I achieved some thick->thin and critical mass.

--fuxi: microsoft acquired Mono project and produced dotnet core (Sunil) as a jvm challenger to run on non-windows platforms
Let's see how it catches on

I think mono project may be better off as independent but endorsed by Microsoft

--fuxi: oth: system architect career path that Qihao described 
I'm biased against such a career path. I think some interviewers expect the contractor to bring valuable experience to the table and propose solutions (to be decided by the app owner)

Q: was I able to play that role? 
A: I think Josh actually felt I was able to. I think that was at a micro level, but I might be able to at higher level as well.

A: I think Venkat and Shubin actually noticed it 

I think Yang, Chad... were more successful doing this, though I didn't like Yang's java solutions. 

I probably have a blogpost on my past record. Overall, I think this "promise" is not easy to deliver. My track record was mixed.

In recent jobs, I have not been very keen, determined to overcome the challenges and propose new ideas. To score a point, I don't really need to get it implemented. 

I feel at Mvea I lost the initial drive.

--fuxi: plowback into c++
After my java conquest, I decided to avoid build-up to jxee. I decided to deepen and branch-out to c++.

I believed the stability of c++ would favor older coders like me, but now I feel c++ is mostly chosen by HFT i.e. type2. 
The type1/type3 WallSt c++ shops represent roughly half the market and (yes!) provided some small ROI.

c++ did help my coreJava QQ.

c++ did strengthen my profile and confidence at web2.0 interviews, as coreJava isn't so dominant therein.

Overall, the plowback is effective but underwhelming. 
It would be more effective where coreJava is less dominant, as in web2.0 and microsoft shops.

--fuxi: the hottest c++ job domain is HFT, but

in SG k-12 schools, i quickly had a deep and complete feeling that no local student was bold, innovative like me, and all were too conformable and compliant.

In hind sight, I can see that some small percentage of local students were unconventional like me, but they didn't want to show it.

* foreign students in local schools -- In local schools, there are also many foreign students, but I consider Malaysian students local.
* non-local schools -- I would guess in international schools the culture would be more diverse, with students from far away or developed countries
* Singapore students educated overseas -- some of them are not so conformable.
* university instead of 1-12 -- I found more local students like me
* At the workplace -- many local graduates are not so conformable.

The peerComp tends to be based on very limited facts and mostly biased imagination.

--in terms of QQ (hard questions by definition), 
95% of the c++0x features cluster around mv-semantics. 

I think this is because c++ is a low-level language.

Also the other template features (beside forward()) are not so prominent.

As soon as we start to work towards better salary , we are on a slippery slope. 
We may feel we are on a reasonable ground, with a reasonable goal, but down the slope there is irrationality, desperation, greed, self-hate, inferiority...
we tend to keep up with the Jones's. Many people compare with the wrong peer group .. including the web2.0 shops
We tend to neglect many valuable things that at end of our lives we would recognize as more important than the rat race

One of the jolting, awakening (一盆凉水) questions is - Granted other people earn a lot more, but i don't need that much money to live a comfortable life, so why do I feel inadequate so often?

I told many friends that I work hard to prepare for interviews but I am Very selective about where to join. 
I focus mostly on the salary level in the WallSt contract market, not the perm salaries. 
This kind of attitude is one small step towards a more rational, more pragmatic perception of the rat race

If I were in a high-cost location where typical household burn rate is 15k, then I would be under pressure to earn more just to keep up.

At Macq, I was unable to impress bosses.

sg job market remains as slow and thin as before. Still financial jobs constitute 90% of my job pool
JC has more suitable jobs than SG has including start-up.

Singapore non-finance companies simply can't afford because the main street dev salary is much lower than U.S.

The wall st salary level is largely influenced by west coast and also main street dev salary. No such influence in SG
