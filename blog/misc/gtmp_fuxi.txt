when we see new foreign products advertized in Singapore, we often see "top-selling in <countryABC>". For food, fashion products, immediately I wonder "would it be a hit or a flop in this local market?"

It depends on the cultural affinity between the originating country and the target country.

I see good affinity between Japan and Sgp, between China and Sgp for food innovation only, between U.S. and Europe, between U.S. and Latam thanks to the large Latino population in U.S.

Which country has the best track record and best chance of bridging the most culture gaps? I feel U.S. is above the rest, followed by Europe, and then Japan.

In any domain, the U.S. tends to produce large numbers of influential figures (considering the U.S. population), much higher than BRIC countries.

However, a much larger number of Americans struggle against livelihood, often falling into hardship temporarily or indefinitely.

What's a simple yardstick for hardship and struggle? Perhaps the WBank's international poverty line?

Singapore is very different. The poor are outnumbered by the wen1bao3 class. Therefore, the government can more easily take care of them. If you look at the number of influential individuals, Singapore's talent pool is not outstanding.

(Most people don't have such a choice, but for those who have) what's your personal goal in choosing a country? Sg is a good choice if you want a comprehensive safety net, and vulnerable protection[kids, elderly, displaced].

U.S. is good if you have aspirations and want to make a name for yourself. 

Image, reputation, credibility, competitive strength is dominated by influential figures, therefore the U.S. ranks top in most domains. That helps the U.S. attract global talents, and stay on top.

In contrast, those other cops were wounded while fighting.

There's no bridge over the Amazon. For most of its course, the river flows through the Amazon Rainforest, where there are very few roads and cities. 

Named by a European, after Greek mythology.

For kids and also adults, when we act aggressively, we need to bear in mind the different aggressive actions.

Worst category is physical (and verbal) aggression, including a small push. In Chinese schools, teachers often ask "who was the first kid to hit the other side?"

Similar to physical aggression, if a kid is angry against someone, the kid can refuse to help that someone. Depending on the context, a helping hand is often considered basic courtesy, so a refusal to help is clearly personal and a passive aggression.

Smashing and angry yelling are not in that category. These are displays of indignation, protest. These can also cross a line in the sand and become aggression, but we usually can see the transition. I feel most of the time, smashing and yelling are not aggressive.  I'm not condoing these actions, but it's important to notice the level of damage -- Smashing something expensive is still less damaging than a push or various forms of verbal aggressions.

-- fuxi: archive/hide threads on wechat/whatsapp
The list of wechat contacts, the list of linkedin contacts are filled with people I seldom NEED to contact. I dare not delete them because I have no other way to recover their contacts!

The high cost -- With wechat (linkedin much better), these people receive too much sunshine simply because they appear on this wechat list. 

1) It's better to remove them from wechat contact if I have other ways to find them, such email or through other friends.
2) For some other contacts, it's better to archive/hide the conversation thread. This feature is similar to Archive on gmail.
3) ^^^^ In the end, my wechat front page should show only 9 worthwhile contacts.

The wechat/whatsapp/linkedin lifestyle is for people whose personal time and priorities fall within their (large) circle of friends. This lifestyle is a very poor match for my needs. 

I do have a need to connect with a small circle of "friends and family". I much prefer 1) meet-up 2) email. Phone call is a distant third choice. Chat is the worst choice for me.

He actually believe his active workload at age 84 is harming his health. I feel irrelevance would be more detrimental to his health, but perhaps he has never thought of irrelevance.
