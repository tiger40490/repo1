-- fuxi: Tokyo subway tickets
At many subway stations, the fare charts include two versions. Version 1 is (probbly simpler map) same-company. Version 2 is cross-company.

Eg: From Tawaramachi to Asakusa, there are two types of tickets

1) same-company (cheaper)... If you travel (including transfers) entirely within one company's network, then you won't need a connecting ticket.
2) cross-company (higher cost) i.e. connecting ticket .. If there is any transfer between two networks like between Toei and TokyoMetro, then you need to exit one system Before you can enter the other system. At the "other system" entrance, your type 1 ticket would fail!

-- fuxi or new: restaurant side dishes 
In most restaurants and in most side dishes [appetizer, dessert,,,], portion size is below half the portion size of a main dish, but price is usually above 70% of a standard main dish. Clearly lower value for money.

Desserts are even smaller than side dishes. 

I wonder why this high cost. I think restaurant cost is not so much on the raw material. Cost of 2x portion of a side dish is perhaps 3% higher. In contrast, main cost is probably labor cost including taking order, explaining, wash-up.

Rabid infected wolves .. account for most of the attacks
unprovoked attacks are rare but do happen

Unarmed human need to find weapons such as sticks. Even a short blade could be valuable. Your teeth and nails are useless.

An unarmed man has close to zero chance to defeat an adult wolf
* man has weight and height advantages. Wolf would drag him to the ground.
* wolf is far superior in agility and can dodge your blows or kicks. I think your futile strikes would soon wear you down.
* wolf has no vulnerability like men's exposed neck and face. It's hard to hit its eyes.
* man has strong kicks (than arms) but hard to use as defense against a wolf
* wolf is far superior in running, so men has no hope of outrunning a wolf.

wolf could bite on your wrist first. A few bites could break your bones. The final kill is on the neck, presumably after the hands are crippled.

This topic goes beyond the gz blog. I hope this bpost lives on.

why by and large older people tend to become better (verbal) communicators? because of daily practice and continuous learning.
The "practice" is interactive and the learning comes with immediate and continuous feedback.

Exception -- some less-used vocab may become rusty. I guess writing a dairy helps you retain vocabulary.

I read more and more respected authors echoing a personal reflection -- a prepared/planned journey to end of one's life is a less painful, less regretful, more fulfilling journey.

One Chinese academic wrote that over the next 10 years of his life (80s), he reminded himself of two serious adversities -- sudden death, and disabilities. (He wrote two essays about 渴望猝死 and wheelchairs.)

I tend to plan for (no fixation) job loss and income drop. Now I also plan for health decline in myself and my parents (not my wife). I think it is a good idea to think about death well before we are forced to. These topics make worthwhile discussions with friends, but might be too negative for the family.

In the last few (up to 12) months, my subconscious definition of success has shifted from successE to successZ.
Why zqbx? It's becuase of challenges. 
I think my challenges are real, not frivolous complaints of a spoilt kid.
They require zqbx, resilient attitude and continuous effort

My aging parents.
My effort on EDyw, workout, 
my strugles in parenting 
my slowly declining productivity, but my memory shows no decline
self-doubt about my fitness for finDev job market
challenges in dhost billing, site blocking
challenges in overseas rEstate

An element of successE is buffer/shield. (I have many bposts on these keywords .. close2heart) They protect my ezlife

eg: pay rise and big bonus get me more pressue from expectation, not more successE ... 

I think some of these struggles can break a person, or keep a person in lower class.
Self-motivation, self-regulation, based on self-understanding can be a change agent.
Blogg and cognitive self-help can make a huge differnece in these struggles.

Imagine you have been struggling against a serious personal disadvantage in a new place, you then notice another personal disadvantage. It would look worse than it actually is. Your self-esteem (self-image) is already compromised and vulnerable before this second blow.

A few powerful examples:

eg: when I first came to SG. I struggled with English. Then I notice my age is older than my classmates.
eg: when I first came to U.S. I struggled with "status" and (mostly tech) interview. Then I notice my wife's lack of education and English skills.
eg: When Satya (MSFT CEO) and wife had their first child with a problem, he took it in his stride. Then his second child also needed a lot of help, as he said in an interview.

-- [22] update or fuxi
Among many Chinese peers like ML.J,,,,   Yang was very playful with the controllers, all of them China girls. I just felt uncomfortable playing such a role.

When I reconnected with Li Meiqin sometimes in the early 2000s, my friend the businessman Weifeng.Xiao urged me to disclose her number to him. (WF.X had nothing to lose.) I had to pick up the phone and call Li again.. uncomfortable!
Now, WF.X was very comfortable on the phone, but I was more comfortable writing emails. At that age, I lacked the insight, the self-knowledge to see that huge, glaring personality difference. I felt I must muster up courage (to call people) if I were to amount to anything... wrong perception, wrong judgement.

WF.X also used "distrust" as a threat "If you don't give her number to me, then it shows your distrust". Actually, it's nothing to do with trust! If a dying grandma told her doctor not to reveal something to her surviving husband, and the doctor agreed, then he has to keep his promise. Nothing to do with trust for the husband.

I see good affinity between Japan and Sgp, between China and Sgp for food innovation only, between U.S. and Europe, between U.S. and Latam thanks to the large Latino population in U.S.

How would you feel if your citizenship application (and only yours) is refused 3 times without explanation?

How would you feel if your GreenCard application is delayed by your employer for 5 years, but you realized it is across the board?

How would you feel receiving a doughnut bonus (Andy.Zh** ?), but you get to know it's across the board for all AVPs?

For kids and also adults, when we act aggressively, we need to bear in mind the different aggressive actions.

Worst category is physical (and verbal) aggression, including a small push. In Chinese schools, teachers often ask "who was the first kid to hit the other side?"

Similar to physical aggression, if a kid is angry against someone, the kid can refuse to help that someone. Depending on the context, a helping hand is often considered basic courtesy, so a refusal to help is clearly personal and a passive aggression.

Smashing and angry yelling are not in that category. These are displays of indignation, protest. These can also cross a line in the sand and become aggression, but we usually can see the transition. I feel most of the time, smashing and yelling are not aggressive.  I'm not condoing these actions, but it's important to notice the level of damage -- Smashing something expensive is still less damaging than a push or various forms of verbal aggressions.

how do I practice some driving to prevent forgetting
Can I practice in China?

--fuxi jolt:
https://psychcentral.com/blog/5-gifts-of-being-highly-sensitive/ shows I'm sensitive to everything but other people's feelings, but this might be oth!

--fuxi: buy 1 get 1 free
I found this offer completely useless.

Sometimes they may suggest that you give away the 2nd unit as a gift. I have never liked the idea.

I don't want to waste my time listening to such a useless offer.

--fuxi jolt: when I get fixated on brank I had better remember Maslow's perception@reality

* Look, this guy has a fancy car... but a car is a liability not an cashcow assets like div stock
* Do they have a beautiful wife?
* Do they have a branded degree?
* Do they have an accomplished father?
* Do they have a healthy mother?
* Do they have two lovely kids?

--fuxi: good to review my reactions to random adversities
* trespass
* credit card fraud
* overcharge on my accounts

--fuxi: worst stressful period=2008-09
After boy was born, my stress profile deteriorated quickly over long and short term. T-budget strain.. heavy responsibility
I had no passive income  to supplement my salary,,, belt-tightening
My stress profile was significantly worse than 2006 in SG, despite my higher income. 

fear of job loss
I had no "multiple countries" to choose from. I fact I felt trapped and unwanted. I briefly considered quitting the U.S. returning to SG...
PIP was the main stressor
Salary was low -- actually a stressor since U.S. burn rate was much higher than in SG.
long commute from Brooklyn. Couldn't afford $2.5k rental in Jersey City.
Camp-out was a relief
java market depth as a parachute, cushion and safety net, was unavailable to me at that time.

--fuxi: grandpa said I need to slow down in speaking

--the 2 recurring pains captured in my blogs
1) PIP
2) peer comparison -- such as left-behind, brank (but how about beautiful wife, wellness, edu credentials)

Now I can name the 3rd recurring pain -- boy's current (rather than longer-horizon) academic situation, such as (but not limited to) motivation level and time-mgmt

--fuxi: bindi's suggestion:
look in the mirror and tell yourself "You are good enough".

Q: Do you ever think it's vulnerable to acknowledge and disclose your true weakness?
A: Sometimes I believe it's a sign of strength, but only when the weakness is something I am comfortable with, not my worst weakness

====martyrdom 
martyrdom is fundamentally related to my burn/rot concept

-- Origin of this word -- One who voluntarily suffers death as the penalty for refusing to renounce their religion

-- idealist purity
By my standard, every human is lazy, weak, loser

-- no pain no gain -- is A related phrase. I addressed this point when a MorganStanley colleague described my extreme diet as self-discipline (more like self-restraint). I said deprivation is unsustainable.

-- Burn/rot is mostly materialistic pursuit + self-discipline ... martyrdom?

--jolt:
my introspective self-discovery is iterative, self-correcting and endless like editing a wikipedia article. 
I don't feel very effective because there are always too many things I don't understand about myself...

However, I never feel inferior (hopeless compared to "them") as felt in yoga, coding practice, or moving-up

--no blog
If no kids, then I feel I would have won the war against FOMO and pretty much all the battles I care to fight.

If no wife, then I would have won more completely more comfortably.

--fuxi: 
Singaporean amateur sports participants tend to use high-end equipment because... they can afford it.

I used to say that despite the world-class facilities, SG is not producing world-class athletes. 

Now I feel a major goal of the SG government is promoting physical wellness of the average Singaporeans. So quality of facilities do matter. 

--fuxi:
Chinese students are no longer the most motivated once in college. Other nationalities catch up as they find the motivation.

I think my son may be that type of late bloomer

My sister is a late bloomer. She didn't give up working hard.

On the job, I can see the Chinese colleagues NOT more motivated than other nationalities, not at all.

--no hurry Q: am I avoiding the tough and high-leverage "burn" jobs?
* yoga ... is by far the toughest job... actually am taking on the challenge 
* jogging .. is more comfortable than yoga
* pull-up and push-up
* coding drill
(QQ is more comfortable than coding drill)
* BGC planning  -- am taking it on by talking to Raymond and Chun Tih. Not really high leverage.
* boy's math -- am taking it on
* work project and localSys xx -- am taking on some of the challenges. 
* FX robot? not so tough
* standing to work

--fuxi: more popular more powerful tools != always better
even though there are more powerful tools than treeSizeFree, I found this tool simple and effective.

Even though there are more powerful tools than wordweb, I found this tool simple and effective.

--fuxi: do not remove usb cable from TV while transferring files.

--fuxi: endocrinology -- sounds like end of creek
--fuxi: tech xx on youtube
why my friends all prefer videos to reading text, even for tech xx
it requires less focused attention.
I feel most of them don't re-visit.

--Filipinos (Caribbeans? Nigerians?) can speak decent Eng but 
Most can't earn a living in US/UK/Canada/Australia or Singapore.

Language proficiency is necessary but insufficient... There are huge cultural differences between two English-speaking countries at different affluence levels.

Affluence (more than the technology) determines the culture.

--fuxi: the more carefully I prepare something, the higher my risk of disappointment
* eg: prepare math worksheet for boy
* eg: wife or mom prepares a meal for me
* eg: quant study
* eg: many weekends bring boy out and study renzi

--new?
Over this hibernation period I could target
respect at work
weight and diet habit 
boy's studies -- benchmark++
net savings, 
fitness -- esp. yoga, 
coding drill -- hard to measure
QQ gain -- easier than coding drill
...

qSG period I focused on some questionable targets (dnlg QQ, C++/c# trec, branch-out, renzi) and didn't feel fulfilled, probably due to PIP. I did achieve basic ffree and trec in c++.

c++US period I had success with c++ trec, weight, yoga, coding drill, housing plan, but rather few visible progress.

as I age, more resources focused on wellness, parenting, per-investment, unfortunately less on tech xx

I can possibly focus on maintenance -- coreJava, c++. coding drill? Not sure

Which do I prefer? #all relatively unbalanced, but realistic

Scenario 1: maintain the super-healthy weight (64kg) and diet; some respect; no visible progress esp. with boy

Scenario 2: QQ build-up, maintain c++critical mass, keep up coding drill, weight maintain at 66 kg but no other visible progress

Scenario 3: huge time on math without benchmark improvement; some respect; but no visible progress.

Scenario 4: some time on math without benchmark improvement; some respect; some QQ/codingDrill; weight back up to 67 - 70kg

--fuxi: 
as soon as I set up an "expectation" in any of these areas (often for self-motivation), i can hit disappointments, stress, tough "adjustments"
* intimacy
* GC
* bonus
* consistent coding drill
* weight, chin-up, consistent yoga
* my cholesterol level
* boy's math

--fuxi: Over the 2019 final days in the U.S. i felt very lucky
* surprise improvement -- C++ critical mass while coreJava remains a competency
* surprise improvement -- CIV is now becoming my 2nd competitive advantage after QQ
* [unbroken] health + vitality 
* [unbroken] marriage
* new plan of dev-till-70
* surprise improvement -- most young talents shun the contract job market, for fundamental reasons, leaving the field wide open to me.
* surprise improvement (tentative) -- startup and web2.0 shops are emerging as new frontiers, beside ibanks. Remember the c#/quant/swing adventures
* surprise improvement (short term) -- contract rate slowly rising

With my marketable skills + health, in the U.S. everything will work out in my personal life, 
* even though U.S. convenience level is low
* even though U.S. commute is much worse than SG. Some WFH will help.
* even though my kids may not become top students
* even though my wife may not find meaningful job

--fuxi x 2
enjoying the airport lounge food, I feel my kids would feel .... privileged?
But I don't want them to feel inferior when they don't have it. So perhaps the feeling of privilege is a double-edged sword, to be managed.

Perhaps most of us can't remove the sense of privilege or inferiority/deprivation.

I have a chance to emerge from the crowd and remove that sense. I have intellectual power

--fuxi x 3
perhaps I have an adjustment problem with negative feedback. 
The problem is my reaction to the feedback. 
I feel my sister and my son may be more effective. 

I feel I can do better. I can learn coping strategies. 
I can relax as grandpa suggested. 
I can learn to live in peace with the negative feedback. 
If I put in a reasonable effort and manager accepts it without a bonus, then I feel I can be happy. 
If I put in a reasonable effort but manager clearly indicates "unacceptable", then I feel i would take action to leave

Overall, my reaction to PIP is weaker than my reaction to IV setbacks. 
Traditionally, one of my strengths is positive attitude to IV setbacks. 
It is easy to look at the gap and feel hopeless.

Parenting also requires this capacity. [[Learned optimism]]] listed Permanent as one hallmark of pessimists.

The honeymoon of engagement (on coding drill, localSys, GTD, emailing to friends ..) is joy and pleasure in itself.

eg@engage: morning quiet time... the zone
eg@engage: on flights
eg@engage: weekend coding assignments

-- fuxi x 1: intrinsic mtv is rather rare in most commercial domains

Arts (including fine arts..) are more likely. Personalized service (like nursing, counseling) also possible

--fuxi x 2:
After reading A.Brooks, I assumed that grandpa's health would suffer if he loses relevance after retirement. 

He is very sure it won't happen. He said people in his circle basically keep working until physically unable. He foresees his life to be really busy for a few more years until his health prevents him from working. 

He actually believe his active workload at age 84 is harming his health. I feel irrelevance would be more detrimental to his health, but perhaps he has never thought of irrelevance.
