-- [23]fuxi: how do immigration authorities identify elite talent
For academic talent, research output would be the criterion used by immigration authorities (like an academic employer). However, most elite talents are not in academia.

Criterion: education credentials. "Top 100 unviersity" lend more credibility than almost anything else

Criterion: salary, as decided by an employer with due diligence

-- [23] fuxi: fixation on high school ranking]China
China gaokao is an objective, nation-wide benchmark, usable as a benchmark to rank thousands of high schools. Usable doesn't mean "meaningful", but the ranking (esp. within a city) is a constant fixation among parents.

Q: Why rank universities by the research output including prizes? Because universities exist to conduct research and guide public decision making. Research impact is a //yardstick of excellence and value-creation.

Q: Why rank unviersities by graduate employment [employer recognition, outstanding alumni,,,]? Because universities exist to groom young, productive knowledge-workers.

Universities build and polish their brands over decades, and use their brands to attract students, employer roadshows, staff, researchers/research-funding, donation,,, 
As in any domain, university brands compete for mind share. 

Do these factor apply to high schools? Partially. For example, it's rarely meaningful to benchmark high schools internationally, using pseudo-benchmarks like math Olympiad.

In the China high school landscape, the only real ranking criteria is benchmark result. This kinda ranking is highly emotive and over-emphasized, a national obsession. In many families, the obsession stems from parents' worry over "average high school" that usually means "no chance to a top college" like a 985/211 college.

Branding generates an emotional response among alumni, and a personal motivation to boost a alma-mater's ranking. 

Among my peers, the facination motivates us to monitor my alma-mater's ranking ... a recreational energy-sink.

My ffree calc, my devTill70 plan, my 95 longevity target ,,, all have an implicit assumption of /adequate/ health.

Are these plans and forecasts simplistic?

I think some dose of optimism is good. Positive thinking. 
My specific, measurable goals are effective goals. 
Resilience is a foundation of this optimism. 

In my declining years, I need human support more than financial support. I feel Sgp system provides more human support. In another country, even with a million dollars, you can't get sufficient support. 
You will feel lucky/unlucky primarily due to your health and your support network, rather than pff or brank.

Still, career longevity is crucial as it provides social interaction in addition to an income stream.

After listening to congcong situation, my focus shifted to "howLuckyIWasAsStudent" .. lucky and confident

I feel the China gaokao system is a ruthless pyramid with poor upward mobility -- 

* stratification among colleges has probably increased (985/211) due to 扩招. Even though some 2nd/3rd tier college graduates do become "successful" (successC), parents and the society at large ignore them as statistical outliers
* top high schools have a near "supply monopoly" to top colleges

In China middle schools, if you want top collge, then your chance is low if you don't get into a top high school. Average high schools seldom produce such strong candidates for gaokao. I went though high school system myself and I know it. I also confirmed with a few China friends.
In China high schools, if you want a top college, then you must work hard for 3 years.

In Singapore, many average high schools (JC or poly) can produce candidates for NUS/NTU.

Per 1000 high school graduates, I think "elite tertiary edu resources" are more scarce in China than in Singapore.

Among many Chinese peers like ML.J, Yang was very playful with the controllers, all of them China girls. I just felt uncomfortable playing such a role.

When I reconnected with Li Meiqin sometimes in the early 2000s, my friend the businessman Weifeng.Xiao urged me to disclose her number to him. (WF.X had nothing to lose.) I had to pick up the phone and call Li again.. uncomfortable!
Now, WF.X was very comfortable on the phone, but I was more comfortable writing emails. At that age, I lacked the insight, the self-knowledge to see that huge, glaring personality difference. I felt I must muster up courage (to call people) if I were to amount to anything... wrong perception, wrong judgement.

WF.X also used "distrust" as a threat "If you don't give her number to me, then it shows your distrust". Actually, it's nothing to do with trust! If a dying grandma told her doctor not to reveal something to her surviving husband, and the doctor agreed, then he has to keep his promise. Nothing to do with trust for the husband.

In any domain, the U.S. tends to produce large numbers of influential figures (considering the U.S. population), much higher than BRIC countries.

However, a much larger number of Americans struggle against livelihood, often falling into hardship temporarily or indefinitely.

What's a simple yardstick for hardship and struggle? Perhaps the WBank's international poverty line?

Singapore is very different. The poor are outnumbered by the wen1bao3 class. Therefore, the government can more easily take care of them. If you look at the number of influential individuals, Singapore's talent pool is not outstanding.

(Most people don't have such a choice, but for those who have) what's your personal goal in choosing a country? Sg is a good choice if you want a comprehensive safety net, and vulnerable protection[kids, elderly, displaced].

U.S. is good if you have aspirations and want to make a name for yourself. 

Image, reputation, credibility, competitive strength is dominated by influential figures, therefore the U.S. ranks top in most domains. That helps the U.S. attract global talents, and stay on top.

For kids and also adults, when we act aggressively, we need to bear in mind the different aggressive actions.

Worst category is physical (and verbal) aggression, including a small push. In Chinese schools, teachers often ask "who was the first kid to hit the other side?"

Similar to physical aggression, if a kid is angry against someone, the kid can refuse to help that someone. Depending on the context, a helping hand is often considered basic courtesy, so a refusal to help is clearly personal and a passive aggression.

Smashing and angry yelling are not in that category. These are displays of indignation, protest. These can also cross a line in the sand and become aggression, but we usually can see the transition. I feel most of the time, smashing and yelling are not aggressive.  I'm not condoing these actions, but it's important to notice the level of damage -- Smashing something expensive is still less damaging than a push or various forms of verbal aggressions.

--fuxi: worst stressful period=2008-09
After boy was born, my stress profile deteriorated quickly over long and short term. T-budget strain.. heavy responsibility
I had no passive income  to supplement my salary,,, belt-tightening
My stress profile was significantly worse than 2006 in SG, despite my higher income. 

fear of job loss
I had no "multiple countries" to choose from. I fact I felt trapped and unwanted. I briefly considered quitting the U.S. returning to SG...
PIP was the main stressor
Salary was low -- actually a stressor since U.S. burn rate was much higher than in SG.
long commute from Brooklyn. Couldn't afford $2.5k rental in Jersey City.
Camp-out was a relief
java market depth as a parachute, cushion and safety net, was unavailable to me at that time.

--fuxi: grandpa said I need to slow down in speaking

--the 2 recurring pains captured in my blogs
1) PIP
2) peer comparison -- such as left-behind, brank (but how about beautiful wife, wellness, edu credentials)

Now I can name the 3rd recurring pain -- boy's current (rather than longer-horizon) academic situation, such as (but not limited to) motivation level and time-mgmt

--fuxi: bindi's suggestion:
look in the mirror and tell yourself "You are good enough".

Q: Do you ever think it's vulnerable to acknowledge and disclose your true weakness?
A: Sometimes I believe it's a sign of strength, but only when the weakness is something I am comfortable with, not my worst weakness

====martyrdom 
martyrdom is fundamentally related to my burn/rot concept

-- Origin of this word -- One who voluntarily suffers death as the penalty for refusing to renounce their religion

-- idealist purity
By my standard, every human is lazy, weak, loser

-- no pain no gain -- is A related phrase. I addressed this point when a MorganStanley colleague described my extreme diet as self-discipline (more like self-restraint). I said deprivation is unsustainable.

-- Burn/rot is mostly materialistic pursuit + self-discipline ... martyrdom?

my introspective self-discovery is iterative, self-correcting and endless like editing a wikipedia article. 
I don't feel very effective because there are always too many things I don't understand about myself...

However, I never feel inferior (hopeless compared to "them") as felt in yoga, coding practice, or moving-up

--no blog
If no kids, then I feel I would have won the war against FOMO and pretty much all the battles I care to fight.

If no wife, then I would have won more completely more comfortably.

Singaporean amateur sports participants tend to use high-end equipment because... they can afford it.

I used to say that despite the world-class facilities, SG is not producing world-class athletes. 

Now I feel a major goal of the SG government is promoting physical wellness of the average Singaporeans. So quality of facilities do matter.

Chinese students are no longer the most motivated once in college. Other nationalities catch up as they find the motivation.

My sister is a late bloomer. She didn't give up working hard.

On the job, I can see the Chinese colleagues NOT more motivated than other nationalities, not at all.

--no hurry Q: am I avoiding the tough and high-leverage "burn" jobs?
* yoga ... is by far the toughest job... actually am taking on the challenge 
* jogging .. is more comfortable than yoga
* pull-up and push-up
* coding drill
(QQ is more comfortable than coding drill)
* BGC planning  -- am taking it on by talking to Raymond and Chun Tih. Not really high leverage.
* boy's math -- am taking it on
* work project and localSys xx -- am taking on some of the challenges. 
* FX robot? not so tough
* standing to work

--Filipinos (Caribbeans? Nigerians?) can speak decent Eng but

Language proficiency is necessary but insufficient... There are huge cultural differences between two English-speaking countries at different affluence levels.

Affluence (more than the technology) determines the culture.

Over this hibernation period I could target
respect at work
weight and diet habit 
boy's studies -- benchmark++
net savings, 
fitness -- esp. yoga, 
coding drill -- hard to measure
QQ gain -- easier than coding drill
...

qSG period I focused on some questionable targets (dnlg QQ, C++/c# trec, branch-out, renzi) and didn't feel fulfilled, probably due to PIP. I did achieve basic ffree and trec in c++.

c++US period I had success with c++ trec, weight, yoga, coding drill, housing plan, but rather few visible progress.

as I age, more resources focused on wellness, parenting, per-investment, unfortunately less on tech xx

I can possibly focus on maintenance -- coreJava, c++. coding drill? Not sure

Which do I prefer? #all relatively unbalanced, but realistic

Scenario 1: maintain the super-healthy weight (64kg) and diet; some respect; no visible progress esp. with boy

Scenario 2: QQ build-up, maintain c++critical mass, keep up coding drill, weight maintain at 66 kg but no other visible progress

Scenario 3: huge time on math without benchmark improvement; some respect; but no visible progress.

Scenario 4: some time on math without benchmark improvement; some respect; some QQ/codingDrill; weight back up to 67 - 70kg

--no blogpost: my current struggles #tectonic:
^ respect and figure-out-speed ] localSys
v boy's math? Is it my job or his job? In theory If I don't take any ownership then the pressure is completely off ... but realistically?
* [t] calorie count? I feel the Singapore climate adds 5 kg, even if my starch intake is halved 3 times
v yoga? now easier once I paid the membership fee :)
v c++/coreJava critical mass maintenance 
v [t?] CIV? LG2. How about review or simple problems?
v personal finance including housing plan
* [t=tough struggle]

* intimacy
* GC
* bonus
* consistent coding drill
* weight, chin-up, consistent yoga
* my cholesterol level
* boy's math

--fuxi: Over the 2019 final days in the U.S. i felt very lucky
* surprise improvement -- C++ critical mass while coreJava remains a competency
* surprise improvement -- CIV is now becoming my 2nd competitive advantage after QQ
* [unbroken] health + vitality 
* [unbroken] marriage
* new plan of dev-till-70
* surprise improvement -- most young talents shun the contract job market, for fundamental reasons, leaving the field wide open to me.
* surprise improvement (tentative) -- startup and web2.0 shops are emerging as new frontiers, beside ibanks. Remember the c#/quant/swing adventures
* surprise improvement (short term) -- contract rate slowly rising

With my marketable skills + health, in the U.S. everything will work out in my personal life, 
* even though U.S. convenience level is low
* even though U.S. commute is much worse than SG. Some WFH will help.
* even though my kids may not become top students
* even though my wife may not find meaningful job

enjoying the airport lounge food, I feel my kids would feel .... privileged?
But I don't want them to feel inferior when they don't have it. So perhaps the feeling of privilege is a double-edged sword, to be managed.

Perhaps most of us can't remove the sense of privilege or inferiority/deprivation.

I have a chance to emerge from the crowd and remove that sense. I have intellectual power

--fuxi x 3
perhaps I have an adjustment problem with negative feedback. 
The problem is my reaction to the feedback. 
I feel my sister and my son may be more effective. 

I feel I can do better. I can learn coping strategies. 
I can relax as grandpa suggested. 
I can learn to live in peace with the negative feedback. 
If I put in a reasonable effort and manager accepts it without a bonus, then I feel I can be happy. 
If I put in a reasonable effort but manager clearly indicates "unacceptable", then I feel i would take action to leave

Overall, my reaction to PIP is weaker than my reaction to IV setbacks. 
Traditionally, one of my strengths is positive attitude to IV setbacks. 
It is easy to look at the gap and feel hopeless.

Parenting also requires this capacity. [[Learned optimism]]] listed Permanent as one hallmark of pessimists.

--fuxi x 2:
After reading A.Brooks, I assumed that grandpa's health would suffer if he loses relevance after retirement. 

He is very sure it won't happen. He said people in his circle basically keep working until physically unable. He foresees his life to be really busy for a few more years until his health prevents him from working. 

He actually believe his active workload at age 84 is harming his health. I feel irrelevance would be more detrimental to his health, but perhaps he has never thought of irrelevance.
