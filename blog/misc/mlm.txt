I feel lucky that within 12 hours, my wife calmed down. The morning after the chat, she was no longer blaming me.
She decided to give away some of her lipsticks.

I hope she realized that this scheme is likely to be illegal in Singapore. If identified as MLM, then her name would be in the police record and her career would in jepordy

--last thing to say?
If this scheme is identified as illegal MLM, then all participants (incuding the leaf level) are in breach of the law.

My police report would show that ZLH broke the law knowingly (Öª·¨·¸·¨). This is a more serios offense.

If convicted, it will affect your career in Singapore or other countries.

--police officer said "google legend age multilevel" and you will see many allegations

Reddit has a MLM list including legend age.

--acid test: refund
Personal agreement doesn't count.
Refund must clawback all the commissions paid to the uplines. A refund through a true MLM system would be hard to imagine.

--acid test: joining fee
Q: can you earn commission without buying inventory, like a property agent or car salesman

--be very respectful, not condescending
stay focused and factual
stay cool and supportive

It's good that most of her money is in securities less liquid than bank accounts.
