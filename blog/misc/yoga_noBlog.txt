--fuxi: floor fwd bend: better start with knees bent

-- fuxi: many women are married to husbands who don't pay enough attention to flexibility. Both husband and wife suffer as a result
Men are natually tighter.
I feel proud about my commitment (more than attitude) to flexibility. I think it's foresight.

-- fuxi: looking at my yoga classmates including many super-flexible women, I remind myself that they are probably unimpressive in fitness, balance, strength etc.

I realize my priorities are
1) BMI
2) cardio and muscle endurance
) strength
) flexibility
) power

So I feel my current position is superior and enviable compared to them.

--fuxi: stretch in shower: prefer sitting postures for safety.

-- fuxi: Like the challenge of sustainable yoga. Chin-up is a smaller challenge. 
I think the key is frequency. Aim at a few reps every day or every 2 days.

Yoga is not a contest. 

When I'm very tight in some part, then certain pose is tough but beneficial, and good ROI and ROTI. 
In contrast, some very flexible students don't improve and don't benefit much in terms of flexibility (they come for relaxation), and may feel compelled to go into more advanced poses. I guess those poses are more difficult and dangerous, therefore hard to practice without assistance, 

-- fuxi: flexibility is a lifelong struggle, visible weakness
Rather few parts of my life has been this difficult.

persistent, hopeless lack of positive feedback .. Promethean struggle.

-- fuxi: Belinda pointed out mobility vs flexibility (obstacle holding some body part) 
She hinted that mobility might be more important to many older people, in everyday living.

-- fuxi: buy a yoga mat
Leave it on the floor everyday. Not so much space
A kind of nudge. It may or may not be enough to overcome the huge obstacle. 

Sugg: get wife to ..

When I bought the standing desk, I also envisioned using it for leg stretch ..

~~ Disuse after honeymoon? If it can increase my practice by 1h/week for 20 weeks, it's worthwhile. But I don't envision myself keep it there for years.
cost compared to yoga classes?
cost compared to the importance of stretch?

I had a blue yoga mat for years ... 

Q: lifestyle creep, knowing that after 20 weeks it would be put away?

some yoga teacher/students probably welcome male students.

* tight male students can help make some students feel less tight
* strong male students often has better energy, balance or endurance
* teacher would feel good to have a wider range of participants

-- fuxi:
when I tell yoga teachers that I'm still beginner, they may worry that I would be negative about their teaching. 

It's like bad-mouthing past employers during a job interview.

--fuxi: advice from two BGC yoga instructors on my lower-back fwd bend.
* standard fwd-bend can also include knee-bend to provide better focus on lower-back.

Since tight hamstring often interfere with lower-back stretching, each time we need to prioritize between them. Lower back is more important than hamstring.

--fuxi: Saumik advice:
stretch should be enjoyable, not painful. I guess it should be tolerable if not enjoyable.
