BBC program on intermittent fasting features many researcher who practice intermittent fasting. However, if a research paper uses a sample size of one, then the research has zero statistical significance.

It is important to know if the the researcher himself believes the result and adopts a lifestyle consistent with it.

But that doesn't mean the practice is safe for all healthy adults.

Lesson learned from NY2024
small ice creams, small cakes worked better for BMI and waste reduction, even though higher unit cost. The pistachio cake was way too big.

I chose to relax my "delay meal" rule again (relaxed frequently in SG like company meals, family meals...) because it was impractical at that time. As HuiMei said, I need quality of life.

99% of foods advertized in mass media are calorie-dense by my standard -- high starch (#1 most common), high fat (#2 most common) [creamy]

I basically rely on Sys2 to ignore and avoid those attention grabbers, but Sys1 would be drawn to them automatically.

-- fuxi: compensation when coming home
when I come home from office, I look forward to (expectation of) a reward for the sacrifices, an unwinding of the strict control 
I feel I deserve some comfort food.

It feels too harsh to deny myself of the comfort foods.

Luckily I don't demand starch or fattty comfort foods. Fancy fruits are fine.

It is a sign of good appetite for relatively healthy foods. You don't want get rid of this appetite, do you? What you want to get rid of is the unexpected food

today's (late Jun) Chinatown lunch is famliar. Hopefully my past experience help me improve.

Better than home cooking in terms of unlimited quantity. 3 out of 4 dishes have limited quantity. At home, generally the quantity is higher.

rice .. I had a controlled indulgence. In the next few days I will reflect. There will be very limited evidence, so I may not have enough of a rational reason to change my behavior.

leftovers .. at home, I finished some of the leftovers without rice :)

street food + YueHwa .. thanks to my full stomach (https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/2021/05/02/fullnessavailability-hunger/), I didn't buy any :) Buying would lead to "obligation". So a "controlled indulgence" is a double-edged sword with unforeseen ramification.

I have tried Ikea cafe food more than 10 times. I think it's slightly healthier than average. 
Obviously, at every restaurant, your personal choice of foods is the deciding factor. Ikea tends to offer more varieties of relatively healthy choices.

Still, I believe "reasonable" self-disciple in this context is simply insufficient. Your nutrional balance is probably reasonable, but there would be too much fat and insufficient vegetables. The overall cCost would be too high.

I think majority of attractive foods are similar. It's rare to find attractive yet healthy foods. 

-- fuxi: knowing that BMI is not that critical when your nutrional mix is excellent, I still want to ask
Q: is it possible to put on weight by eating lots of carrots, and other raw veg + fruits?
A: I don't think so. In theory, possible, but I seriously doubt it.

I think the amount of meat, starch and fat might be underestimated.

many foods are advertised as "healthy" for no reason beside a trace amount of omega3 oil, or heart-healthy oil, or antioxidant or some fiber
The marketing propaganda exaggerates those small ingredients and say nothing about the excess amount of oil, sugar, animal fat, etc

Cocacola and other beverage vendors have worked for decades to improve the appeal of sugar-free products.

I think most people still find those drinks inferior and not much better than water.

I think Colacola is trying to keep the customer hooked...

Most cusomers would buy the sugar-free version once a while, and buy the sugary version most of the time. The sugar-free version makes the customer less likely to detract.

how would LKY or a rich guy deal with the temptations of home cooking?

What if money is not an issue? i would live away from family for several days when my diet gets out of control.
Or I could have a maid and give the left-over food to her.

-- fuxi or new: yongTauFoo+salad as stress relief
now at a time of stress, sitting outside Koufu food court, I really need some comfort food, to help me calm down.

However, not really hungry. No craving for ice cream or oily/starchy stuff (in fact, small portion of these foods would likely trigger a craving for bigger portion.. valuable self knowledge.)

Salad with some comfort components (not raw veg alone) is a good choice. Yong Tau Foo is a soup version of salad since raw veg is not popular in Chinese diet. It costs $5 but buys me mild stress relief without the cCost (and guilt/self-hate).

Now, in some cases I still need some more substantial comfort food. The big "salad" as a huge appetizer tends to reduce its portion.

--fuxi: bring tempting foods to office
Nowadays I bring the tempting foods to office.

The worst wrong-* temptation is night time at home. Even when I eat no starch, I still feel a loss-of-control. 

When I eat the same food the next morning or in office, I feel (much) more in-control.

--fuxi: carrot: storage cost and price tag cheaper than cucumber

--fuxi: once my stomach is stretched due to a few big meals, it tends to send stronger hunger signal earlier than before.
My mom said this many years ago. She could be right, and based on experience.

Now I have got used to big meals in 2020, I don't remember why I was able to live happily with half the food.

now vs 2019, my bmi is worse due to 4kg, even though
* i have maintained my starch abstinence and veg/fruit + milkshake
* I have maintained my meal delay
* I have maintained to some extent intermittent fasting. I believe (without enough evidence) that iFF I cut the late night meal then BMI would improve

I may have to accept status quo for now and keep working on BMI

most foods pictured in commercials are calorie-dense. Better avoid looking at them.

People get used to calorie-dense foods and crave for more. Food outlets and visual advertisements cater to their craving

Around the time of SiemReap flight booking, I ate quite a lot of starchy foods grandma bought or cooked.

This is a classic case study.

One factor is stress. The flight booking was stressful.

One factor is wrong-* temptations. In this case, there was a bit of wrong-time temptation in the morning after the flight booking. I was not hungry, but I gave in to the temptation after the food was heated.

One factor is quality of nutrition. This starchy food is not as bad as creamy cakes or ice cream. I also ate carrot for balance.
 
One of the biggest factors in my mind was quantity of calories. I can only guesstimate that the quantity was huge.

This blogpost is about diet. Beyond diet, a major factor affecting my zsms is the burn/rot/roti on that day. I had a coding drill with Ashish, one of the toughest in 3 months. I then went back to office and did a bit of work. In office I had a stressful call with NCT. I also had a useful dabao coaching session on word problem, one of the most significant in a year. The cambodia trip legwork (visa, flight) was a major effort. I also had a few lotus sessions including in ofifce.. In hindsight, I dismissed/forgot these non-trivial achievements on that day and zoomed into the diet "loss of control".

--fuxi: wellness review on 2019 bizclass flight, another daily battle
* salad very healthy, without dressing. I ate more salad today than any day over last 6M
* three servings of fruits
* rice I didn't eat up, better than before
* some stretching
* restraint on cakes, chocolate, ice cream etc, not as unconstrained as before 
* before the flight, I did eat lots of fruits + radish

--fuxi x 3: I feel Indians have a problem with slim. I feel their culture associates slim with something negative, perhaps poverty?

In Chinese culture, I can see that BMI 19 is considered unattractive.

In reality, thinning is healthy for most people.
