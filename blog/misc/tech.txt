--new blogpost: assignment^rebind across languages 
c++ assignment is comparable to a mutator method

for a non-primitive variable, java assignment is always rebinding. Java behavior is well-understood and simple, compared to python.

python assignment is always rebinding in my view, even for an int. Integer is immutable and reference counted.
In python, if you want two functions to share a single integer object, you can declare global int. 
Alternatively, you can wrap the int in a single-element list and call list mutator methods.

See my experiment in github py/88lang

adding "const" can lead to bewildering template errors that don't show any relation to const
