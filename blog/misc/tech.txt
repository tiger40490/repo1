Tower interviewer asked me to elaborate why I claim java is a very clean language compared to c++ (and c#).

I gave the example of q[=]. In java, this is either content update (for primitive data types) or pointer reseat (for reference types). No ifs or buts.

In c++ q[=] can invoke the copy ctor, move ctor, copy assignment, move assignment, conversion ctor, conversion operator. Its meaning is special for a reference variable in initilization vs update

--new blogpost: assignment^rebind across languages 
for a non-primitive variable, java assignment is always rebinding. Java behavior is well-understood and simple, compared to python.

c++ assignment is actually well-documented .. comparable to a mutator method

python assignment is always rebinding afaik, even for an int. Integer is an immutable object, reference counted.

In python, if you want two functions to share a single mutable integer variable, you can declare a global int. 
It would be in the global idic/namespace

Alternatively, you can wrap the int in a single-element list and call list mutator methods.

See my experiment in github py/88lang

adding "const" can lead to bewildering template errors that don't show any relation to const
