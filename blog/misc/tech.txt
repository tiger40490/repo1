--array is the most important data structure
C supports only array (horizontal) and struct (vertical). I feel most standard libraries across languages are designed based on the same. Array + graph are about the only data structures in those libraries and in CIV.

For comp science research, there's more energy focused on array than any other data structure.

Array (among various data structures) is the real focus of micro tuning and hardware optimizations.

--microsoft acquired Mono project and produced dotnet core to run on non-windows platforms

--Azul jvm has optimized GC
--java community support is better than c# or c++
--cloud: golang and java are the most popular languages

--bigData: java is dominant
--ML (data science): python and c++ are the top 2 languages
