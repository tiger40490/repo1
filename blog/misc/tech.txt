--new new new blogpost: java perf^simplicity
Paradoxically
java's syntax simplicity is on par with python, better than c# and much better than c++.
java's performance is on par with c# and c++, largely due to JVM and JIT

java has been popular on web servers, and crucially the newer mobile, cloud, big-data platforms, beating c++, c#, python

java's adoption rate as a foundation platform or integration-target... is better than other languages. Many products are built for java, on java or with java in mind. I'm deliberately vague here because I don't want to spend too much time analyzing this vague, general observation.


--new blogpost 1^2-pass algos
90% of the time 2-pass algo is simpler conceptually.

However, in my 2-pivot partition algo, a single-pass algo is simpler.
