more time with boy on math; less on news or general reading
more time reading bccy; less research on existing stocks
more time on wpress landing page; less on affliate
success: less time on maintaining salary; more on stock picking, esp. SG stocks as I see recovery in SG
.. stock picking needs more sunshine
less time reading CNA despite what Zeng said, but more reading vacations
sleep earlier, sacrificing the quiet hours
less movie time _b_u_t_ More leaves spent on ...
success: more c++ even if lower pay; less new tech [py, docker, cloud, crypto, GO]
diet needs more patience
improving: control DIY tcost .. _b_u_t_ more leaves
improving: more time on self-maintenance in my 40s; less time on the job or tech renewal?
