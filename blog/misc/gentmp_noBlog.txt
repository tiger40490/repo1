Over this hibernation period I could target
respect at work
weight and diet habit 
boy's studies -- benchmark++
net savings, 
fitness -- esp. yoga, 
coding drill -- hard to measure
QQ gain -- easier than coding drill
...

qSG period I focused on some questionable targets (dnlg QQ, C++/c# trec, branch-out, renzi) and didn't feel fulfilled, probably due to PIP. I did achieve basic ffree and trec in c++.

c++US period I had success with c++ trec, weight, yoga, coding drill, housing plan, but rather few visible progress.

as I age, more resources focused on wellness, parenting, per-investment, unfortunately less on tech xx

I can possibly focus on maintenance -- coreJava, c++. coding drill? Not sure

Which do I prefer? #all relatively unbalanced, but realistic

Scenario 1: maintain the super-healthy weight (64kg) and diet; some respect; no visible progress esp. with boy

Scenario 2: QQ build-up, maintain c++critical mass, keep up coding drill, weight maintain at 66 kg but no other visible progress

Scenario 3: huge time on math without benchmark improvement; some respect; but no visible progress.

Scenario 4: some time on math without benchmark improvement; some respect; some QQ/codingDrill; weight back up to 67 - 70kg

--no blogpost: my current struggles #tectonic:
^ respect and figure-out-speed ] localSys
v boy's math? Is it my job or his job? In theory If I don't take any ownership then the pressure is completely off ... but realistically?
* [t] calorie count? I feel the Singapore climate adds 5 kg, even if my starch intake is halved 3 times
v yoga? now easier once I paid the membership fee :)
v c++/coreJava critical mass maintenance 
v [t?] CIV? LG2. How about review or simple problems?
v personal finance including housing plan
* [t=tough struggle]

--fuxi: detach: am I holding too tight onto ...?
my fitness including flexibility?
my diet and weight control? 
my c++/java QQ 
my "conquest" of the age-friendly Wall St job market

--new? no
as soon as I set up an "expectation" in any of these areas (often for self-motivation), i can hit disappointments, stress, tough "adjustments"
* intimacy
* GC
* bonus
* consistent coding drill
* weight, chin-up, consistent yoga
* my cholesterol level
* boy's math

--nothing new: Over the 2019 final days in the U.S. i felt very lucky
* surprise improvement -- C++ critical mass while coreJava remains a competency
* surprise improvement -- CIV is now becoming my 2nd competitive advantage after QQ
* [unbroken] health + vitality 
* [unbroken] marriage
* new plan of dev-till-70
* surprise improvement -- most young talents shun the contract job market, for fundamental reasons, leaving the field wide open to me.
* surprise improvement (tentative) -- startup and web2.0 shops are emerging as new frontiers, beside ibanks. Remember the c#/quant/swing adventures
* surprise improvement (short term) -- contract rate slowly rising

With my marketable skills + health, in the U.S. everything will work out in my personal life, 
* even though U.S. convenience level is low
* even though U.S. commute is much worse than SG. Some WFH will help.
* even though my kids may not become top students
* even though my wife may not find meaningful job

Rahul put his heart into the job. I think my sister does that too.

My son might as well. I need to appreciate that.

I put my heart into theoretical learning, which I want to show my son

enjoying the airport lounge food, I feel my kids would feel .... privileged?
But I don't want them to feel inferior when they don't have it. So perhaps the feeling of privilege is a double-edged sword, to be managed.

Perhaps most of us can't remove the sense of privilege or inferiority/deprivation.

I have a chance to emerge from the crowd and remove that sense. I have intellectual power

perhaps I have an adjustment problem with negative feedback. 
The problem is my reaction to the feedback. 
I feel my sister and my son may be more effective. 

I feel I can do better. I can learn coping strategies. 
I can relax as grandpa suggested. 
I can learn to live in peace with the negative feedback. 
If I put in a reasonable effort and manager accepts it without a bonus, then I feel I can be happy. 
If I put in a reasonable effort but manager clearly indicates "unacceptable", then I feel i would take action to leave

Overall, my reaction to PIP is weaker than my reaction to IV setbacks. 
Traditionally, one of my strengths is positive attitude to IV setbacks. 
It is easy to look at the gap and feel hopeless.

Parenting also requires this capacity. [[Learned optimism]]] listed Permanent as one hallmark of pessimists.

The honeymoon of engagement (on coding drill, localSys, GTD, emailing to friends ..) is joy and pleasure in itself.

eg@engage: morning quiet time... the zone
eg@engage: on flights
eg@engage: weekend coding assignments

--intrinsic mtv is rather rare in most commercial domains

Arts (including fine arts..) are more likely. Personalized service (like nursing, counseling) also possible

--fuxi x 1:
After reading A.Brooks, I assumed that grandpa's health would suffer if he loses relevance after retirement. 

He is very sure it won't happen. He said people in his circle basically keep working until physically unable. He foresees his life to be really busy for a few more years until his health prevents him from working. 

He actually believe his active workload at age 84 is harming his health. I feel irrelevance would be more detrimental to his health, but perhaps he has never thought of irrelevance.

--fuxi x 2: I feel Indians have a problem with slim. I feel their culture associates slim with something negative, perhaps poverty?

In Chinese culture, I can see that BMI 19 is considered unattractive.

In reality, thinning is healthy for most people.

... Likewise, I'm brainwashed to worship brank and overvalue work place interpersonal skills. I'm not good at them but I have something better .. ffree and easy-life (as QiChongLei puts it).
--fuxi x 3: unbroken.. a few nice items
wrist watch
body scale
etone callback
intimacy
weight
