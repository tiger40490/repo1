-- update 43R
Raymond Tan of GEX described co-living in SG condo, which confirmed my hypothesis that 43R arrangement can achieve 2-3 times rental compared to renting out to a single family.

When I first analyzed 43R, I was initially unsure of that.

-- fuxi: Some Aus lenders use Sg credit report, and use disposible income. They consider any loan that's 100% serviced by CPF as ... not a loan(?)
Preferrential treatment to Singaporeans. Slightly.

-- new or update
Singaporeans have a romanticized perception of a landed or free-hold property. Relying on it for wealth-preservation is relying on the local economy over the long horizon. over 100 years, how confident are you about a local economy in, say, a muncipality?

rEstate is overrated among the Chinese. Remember Bryan of RTS?

Chinese investors also have a romanticized perception of gold, but I believe it is less reliable than gov bonds, CPF or annuities. (Also, gold has negative DYOC.)  Many want to leave gold as legacy, but I think it's much better to train the kids to be financial self-reliant.

-- fuxi or new: most upgrading home buyers would max out their borrowing capacity
Delphia of oc is a mortgage specialist. She said majority of Singapore borrowers (probably including foreigners) would max out their loan quantum. One of the most important limits is TDSR. No more than 55% (was 60) of income (including CPF) is allowed to be used for installment. 55% of total income spent on debt servicing .. sounds like low ground. 

I asked her why "majority" has such a motivation. Delphia said many want to maximize their investment. (Delphia herself felt buying at the current price level doesn't sound like good investment.) It's leveraged investment at a very low borrowing cost.

Now I recall Wallace Xu said something similar about American home buyers... they are highly sensitive to rate hike.

t_misperception
appreciation is slow in most locations. Don't believe agents who boast their appreciation potential.

Foreigner demand is dampened by ABSD, esp. in non-prime locations. such locations are mostly sold to local buyers.
