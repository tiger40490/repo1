SG and HK economies experienced fast ascent from 3rd world to 1st world.

This is rather rare. Most rEstate markets do not experience the same.

-- fuxi: CapitaLand is probably less successful less in-control in overseas projects. Don't assign the same value to CapitaLand when the country is not Sg !

-- fuxi: Some Aus lenders use Sg credit report, and use disposible income. They consider any loan that's 100% serviced by CPF as ... not a loan(?)
Preferrential treatment to Singaporeans. Slightly.

-- fuxi:
Singaporeans have a romanticized perception of a landed or free-hold property. Relying on it for wealth-preservation is relying on the local economy over the long horizon. over 100 years, how confident are you about a local economy in, say, a muncipality?

rEstate is overrated among the Chinese. Remember Bryan of RTS?

Chinese investors also have a romanticized perception of gold, but I believe it is less reliable than gov bonds, CPF or annuities. (Also, gold has negative DYOC.)  Many want to leave gold as legacy, but I think it's much better to train the kids to be financial self-reliant.

appreciation is slow in most locations. Don't believe agents who boast their appreciation potential.

Foreigner demand is dampened by ABSD, esp. in non-prime locations. such locations are mostly sold to local buyers.
