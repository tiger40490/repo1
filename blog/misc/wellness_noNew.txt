if you are serious about visible fat, then avoid meat coated with flour. More than half the times I find pieces of fat (or skin) concealed by the coating.

since boy lacks self-control, i can  bring his bad food to office and giving away
What he enjoys most is the buying not the eating !

Boy should pay for it.

most foods pictured in commercials are calorie-dense

People get used to calorie-dense foods and crave for more. Food outlets and visual advertisements cater to their craving

Around the time of SiemReap flight booking, I ate quite a lot of starchy foods grandma bought or cooked.

This is a classic case study.

One factor is stress. The flight booking was stressful.

One factor is wrong-* temptations. In this case, there was a bit of wrong-time temptation in the morning after the flight booking. I was not hungry, but I gave in to the temptation after the food was heated.

One factor is quality of nutrition. This starchy food is not as bad as creamy cakes or ice cream. I also ate carrot for balance.
 
One of the biggest factors in my mind was quantity of calories. I can only guesstimate that the quantity was huge.

This blogpost is about diet. Beyond diet, a major factor affecting my zsms is the burn/rot/roti on that day. I had a coding drill with Ashish, one of the toughest in 3 months. I then went back to office and did a bit of work. In office I had a stressful call with NCT. I also had a useful dabao coaching session on word problem, one of the most significant in a year. The cambodia trip legwork (visa, flight) was a major effort. I also had a few lotus sessions including in ofifce.. In hindsight, I dismissed/forgot these non-trivial achievements on that day and zoomed into the diet "loss of control".

Without maid, let's consider buying pre-washed leafy salad. More available in the U.S. 
In SG context... still Cheaper than maid and will boost my self-esteem.

ERE author said "The amount we spend reflects the extent of failure in our skills and imagination"

However, in wellness I beg to differ. I would take yoga classes and go for 3M dental cleaning because I know (and accept) my failure/limitation in terms of daily flossing. 

--fuxi: sitting in Manila airport gate 9 waiting room, I slowly managed to achieve lotus pose that I never thought possible.

(similarly, the raw leafy salad I ate on 3k762 was something I never thought possible.)

Seat was not as deep as a regular sofa. 
Lotus is one of my weakest poses all my life.

I deserve a lot of credit. 

Hardly noticed but tough improvement

--fuxi: advice from two BGC yoga instructors on my lower-back fwd bend.
* D/dog should prioritize lower back rather than hamstring, and therefore favor knee-bend
* standard fwd-bend can also include knee-bend to provide better focus on lower-back.

Since tight hamstring often interfere with lower-back stretching, each time we need to prioritize between them. Lower back is clearly more important than hamstring.

--fuxi: On the bgc trip, I decided and wrote down that "yoga is more important than remote work"
Yoga requires more absorbency than jogging, QQ, etc

--fuxi: today at the 2 meals with the group, I practiced bao3shan1 tactics, effectively

The milkshake, though expensive, made me feel full, and in-control, self-respected (even superior)

--fuxi: once my stomach is stretched due to a few big meals, it tends to send stronger hunger signal earlier than before.
My mom said this many years ago.

! eating lots of fruits + veg even when not hungry didn't add to my weight. I believe in the calorie numbers.

I feel starch, fat and perhaps protein do add to my weight.

Fish? Not sure

milk? not sure

--fuxi: Saumik advice:
stretch should be enjoyable, not painful.
Postures are important but Modifications are often necessary.
I feel his modifications are not effective for me. 
I would go with my own modifications.

fish pose with block support below the hip and head.

two blocks ... should not be stacked.

To satisfy my craving for chocolates, I can eat more raw veg!

--fuxi: Q: why buy mixed veg rice when I have free home cooking?
A: there are many veg (+meat) missing in my home cooking
A: qty-temptation in home cooking. Outside food is rationed
When I reach home late and the leftover is boxed up, I feel no obligation to "finish that tiny amount". 

--fuxi: Many question whether I need to lose more weight. Time will tell. I believe over 20 years they will realize I was right to focus so much on deep-green zone

Every small decision counts. I feel proud of myself.

--fuxi: for stable cholesterol level, one test per year is good enough. 
Remember to include full blood count

--fuxi: nutrient timing is invented for ultra-endurance athletes. The reserach findings are not directly applicable to the ordinary people.

--fuxi: yoga or jogging [1] can interfere with my xx/codingDrill, boy's math, work laser ...

[1] swimming is more time consuming.

mini-exercise is less interference

--fuxi: wellness review on bizclass flight
* salad very healthy, without dressing. I at the more salad today than any day over last 6M
* three servings of fruits
* rice I didn't eat up, better than before
* some stretching
* plenty of water
* moderate red wine for heart health
* restraint on cakes, chocolate, ice cream etc, not as unconstrained as before 
* before the flight, I did eat lots of fruits + radish

--fuxi: luxury, medically unnecessary -- these commercial offerings are effective for some athletes or patients, but not clinically proven to be nearly as effective as medicines
* skincare products
* hair treatments
* most MLM supplements
* meal timing
