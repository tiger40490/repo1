--fuxi: with science, his foundation is sound, much better than his math abstract thinking.
However, he is not hungry for the marks. Not focused on the marks.
Therefore, his more mature classmates have a clear advantage over him.

What's more important -- marks or learning curiosity?

--which of these two scenarios would a parent fear more:
* my kids go to a mediocre college, get a mediocre job, earning a below-median income -- https://tanbintpy.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=3590&action=edit

* ?? , renegade, deliquent ... get into trouble. Hopefully, low risk if both parents stay with the kids, but consider Aunt Genn. 

if ah-boy is just mediocre, then my harsh attitude (??????) would not help much (i tend to overestimate my influence and power on him) but could threaten the precious bonding.

--fuxi: 5 lang of love for boy
physical gifts
quality time -- keeping company. He doesn't like to be left alone, except with a screen

Q: why does love matter in this academic benchmark race?
A: because support, family bonding ,,, outweights the crazy benchmark

--fuxi: I'm STILL trying to make dabao another tanbin
This tendency is very stubborn and subtle.

He has his own strengths, interests, hobbies, preferred way to solving problems and meeting challenges ....

I have my weaknesses, limitations, faults in my making. Over many years of "adjustment" I have come to terms with some of my limitations. Now I need to accept his limitations. 

Look at Genn. As a parent how would I accept her as she is, rather than a very poor copy of me?

--fuxi: in recent years, most of the "successes" in my academic parenting required immediate reward in the form of fun activities.

It's harder to maintain the _unconditional_ love and endless patience for an older kid.

--fuxi: ????? can help avoid creating in boy a seed of fear, hatred, self-hate 

--fuxi:   no subject
most of my huge effort to help boy was on the same area -- ??, ????,????,????????, ?????
