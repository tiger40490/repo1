-- slow-cooking update livelihood blogs (S.Liu or Maslow)
[[Nomadland]] and many other movies and songs portray the livelihood pressures (even hardships) of ordinary people in relatively affluent locations (affluent as defined by global standard). For example, most Singaporeans would feel some livelihood pressure. 

For these individuals, my ezlife on the cash flow high ground is .. but a dream. 

I like mathematical criteria for that high ground, criteria like brbr, Fuller Wealth. By these criteria, my ezlife and my high ground are realistic for some of them, but they lack key incredients.

In my GEX course, I could see the livelihood pressure of many Singapore /nationals/ in their 40s, 50s and 60s

Compared to my peers, my net asset is not so remarkable. What's remarkable is my Fuller Wealth based on my target quality of life.

sg^us?

In SG, there's free and high-quality telemedicine and online counselling by chat. In U.S. such a free service would see over-demand and create long queues.

Lower-income population spend bigger portion on food + energy [gas, heating,,] Confirmed with Hai.Yi

average Singaporean spends $1k/Y on travel. I think this is higher than other nationals because
* higher disposible income 
* limited domestic tourism market
* domestic attractions are lower value than SEAsia destinations

-- fuxi
My long stay in Bayonne reassured myself that Bayonne is an acceptable location, esp. if I work in JC.
With a growing reserve, I can opt for a lower-paying job in JC, but there could be very good jobs in NYC.

Best choice for family is still living in JC and commuting to JC or NYC. 

Renting in JC is the default choice. flexibility

when I told Sheng.Zeng about SG healthcare/nursing cost in SG^Chn, he pointed out unqualified doctors (庸医), more of a problem in China
-- fuxi or new: boring stock
To various commentators, a boring stock can fit any of these descriptions.

non-volatile .. lower beta, lower chance of quick profit or big loss. Good thing for many investors including perhaps R.Xia

less news coverage, less glamour, less to talk about with friends.

limited research coverage? Actually, many boring stocks are well-researched.

-- fuxi: Jun.Z on cars
German cars are expensive if new, but less valuable than Japanese as a used car. He felt by design Japanese cars can go for many years after first 10Y.

So I had the misperception that German cars are designed better, stronger, more durable.
I think this is really a brainwash by my friends. 

I suspect there's a similar brainwash against wood houses.

in 2021 I feel our conserver lifestyle is now upgrading

Do we need all of the modern fancy conveniences? Look at Nomadland

-- fuxi: "diversity" in a neighborhood means "some concentration of my own ethnic group"

-- fuxi:
In recent years youtube ads show tons of Singapore trainers on investment.. all presenting investment at the center of personal fulfillment.

Financial health is more affected by brbr than income or asset. 

Financial health is far less important than health.

-- fuxi: financial health of LZ.Yu
mortgage outsanding is about 50% of the purchase price. I didn't ask the purchase price.

LZ.Yu said he has only one salary + some small investment income. He emphasized the reliance on his savings. 
His wife can, if so desired, find a job.

LZ needs to bankroll daughter's education beyond bachelor's because he believes Master is necessary.

If we compare property net income. Mine is probably $2k+ but his is negative.

-- fuxi: financial health of wq.l
bought a 120sqm home for 750k. 30Y mtg, serviced entirely by CPF. When there's surplus CPF balance, they would pay down the mtg.

A telltale sign of his strain -- WQ.l feels college cost would be much higher, even with the subsidies and student loans. Even before that phase, Tanko may say that unplanned events could derail their low-cost lifestyle for the next few years.

I think they are a frugal family. I think the mother has to go out and earn a salary.

No property investment. No tuition.

--fuxi: London home price
GBP 50k-100k is needed to buy an "average" home in London. Presumably, the down payment. I think this is higher than Singapore.
-- fuxi: LZ.Yu's wife said many times at least SGD 300k to complete NYU. 
-- SRS .. can buy annuity .. less tax :)
But I don't know any annuity to buy.

--fuxi: again and again, I'm facing the same dilemma:
if each decision is 20k+, then risk of mistake feels unbearable.
If each decision is 1k-, then I feel the oth, obsession, .

Can we strike a balance? I think we may need to be confident.

.. case: properties
.. case: T:US: I think we can sink in large amounts like 3k due to my prev xp
.. case: SIA: due to the commission, I think we should commit 7k+ from SRS
.. case: divAdv fund. Thanks to my prev xp I think we can commit 5k, perhaps from SRS
.. case: gold: thanks to my extensive analysis and due to the large bid/ask spread, i think we can commit bigger amounts like 3K+

--CSY said most private colleges publish an annual fee amount at least 60k
If you don't prepare in advance, can you cope with ths burn rate?

It would require a savings rate of 60k+/Y. If you receive 30k nonwork income, then it would help.

When I told him that I would try to think less of the bonus amount, he pointed out his 30k+ additional burn rate. This amount appears fairly heavy for him.

-- fuxi: barbell portfolio strategy
AA) capture superior returns from long-term irreversible growth
BB) generate stable income to cover short-term mkt volatilities

China eq .. considered AA
millennial wave(?) is also AA

REIT .. considered BB, but I think there are Reits and Reits

By and large I think the AA assets are low-div, and the BB assets are low-growth.

-- fuxi: tanko vs HF.Sun
I can tell both feel the pressure of livelihood (with/out kids). Both are suffering from workload, work stress, work life balance.

i feel tanko doesn't want to but feels pressured to work into old age, until he feels he has saved enough.
He doesn't believe in cpf-life providing sufficient cash payout for his golden years. I won't bother to ask him why.

In contrast, I feel confident to stop working any time but I choose to work full time till my 70's and possibly part-time till my 80's.

-- fuxi: the $8 spent in simlim earphone was an honest mistake. If we are too cautious about these spends, then we could become paranoid, paralyzed and too slow in everyday buying.

Changing to the charging adapter was a reasonable choice as it was not something unneeded, and I didn't know where to find cheaper versions.

-- fuxi jolt: even though I spent $10 on a new iPhone8 screen protector and it cracked around christmas, it was worth $10 simply because I didn't need to see the earlier cracks and feel guilty about my smash. 
At a deeper level, the guilt was bigger than $10.

The christmas crack was not due to negative emotion, poor quality etc, so the $10 cost was easily accepted.

--fuxi: in last Ikea meal, I criticized wife for a tiny $2.60 cheese tart (meimei didn't eat more than one bit), but I spent a much larger $16 on the lamb shank for boy

--fuxi:
After moving to Becky Ma's place at Boston beside Tuft's hospital, I predicted it would be the best rental home for us ever.

Now I predict that the current Hib19 carefree ezlife is the best ever, due to brbr and other things.

--fuxi or update one of my many tanbinvest blogposts like carefree
looking at my age group and younger peers and beyond, why am i financially carefree but they aren't?
#1 current Brbr
#2 long-term medical (including nursing) fund, retirement fund, inflation protection
#3 Fuller wealth: sizeable nonwork income on adequate assets, as measured by burn rate

But some non-financial factors are fundamental to the financial equation -- wellness, stable marriage, the country

--no blog
XH felt $2M asset would support a comfortable burn rate without salary. I said that's too hard for most people. However, I think he is not obsessed and fixated on that target... fortunately for him.

--fuxi
Retirement country's economy is a crucial factor.
My parents are receiving increasing pension. The China system is showing no risk of bankruptcy.

SG's system is mostly based on self-contribution, but the government invests the cpf fund to generate decent return for us. The SGD's strength is based on the local economy.

U.S. system appears to be broken. The social security money we contributed are pooled and distributed based on needs, not based on contribution :(

--fuxi: FCF and big investments
Some higih-earning individuals are unable to buy a home. I think my ex-colleagues Damien, Pinsky (no kids) might be among them. I imagine they don't give it priority. 

They could pay a high rent (up to 40% of their income), take a car loan to drive an expensive car, ... basically spend 99% of their salary every year. It's never hard to find ways to spend money.

The high rent, of course, goes down the drain. 

Big investments don't necessarily require high brbr, but require savings i.e. FCF.

-- new: $1k reduction ] burn rate
Compared to 2016, my burn rate is down by 2-3k, partly due to pre-school, airfare, ...

Now i understand that $1k to $2k reduction in burn rate means a lot to my (brbr and) sense of confidence, peaceful leisure, wealth. I think this reveals a fundamental difference between me and my peers dismissive of $1k reduction in burn rate.

Exclub wealth? Not enhanced by brbr improvement.

-- fuxi: %%avg return rate
properties outperformed. Even without appreciation, the rental savings alone translates to at least 4% net return
my unit trusts -- probably 2-4%
Private equity -- I managed to recover from a big loss (Airtropolis), so barely positive return overall

A rigorous calc would include unrealized pnl from mark-to-market, ...

I have a blogpost on the highest returns achieved. I think it's in compound

--fuxi: current low burn rate=temporary
I feel the long-term burn rate is SGD 5k including bx premiums, taxes, airtickets

--update blogpost on ...  sg condo not for me
Talking to a few long-term Chinese residents in Singapore, I can see the very strong consensus. Unanimously, they perceive condos as the superior investment, the "sink" of their spare cash.

Same thing has happened in HK, BJ, SH and many Chinese cities. I can see the same 3 indications of over-valuation
* resale_price/salary
* resale_price/burn rate
* rental yield

Zooming into rental yield, I can see that net RY is sinking to 2%. To generate 2.5k/M or 30k/Y, you would need SGD 1.5M invested. CPF-life delivers that same payout with about SGD 400k.

Therefore, SG condo is NOT a superior investment esp. in terms of current income.

--fuxi: compared to condos, sg landed prop has even lower rental demand and yield. See the blogpost on 1BR vs 2BR
Very few renters need such a big home.
Also, most renters don't want to drive every day. Landed properties usually lack public transport connectivity.

I would say landed properties are more of a luxury but still better than luxury cars which depreciate.

-- fuxi: do I prefer cash payment rather than card payment?
cash

card payment adds too much noise to expense tracking and search

--fuxi: I want to make wife feel my sense of wealth, but without spending too much.
Home upgrade is probably the best choice

-- fuxi
even though I'm a single-income family, my brbr is possibly better than many of my U.S. peers with compbined income much higher than mine. 

I feel if their combined income is 300k pretax, their post-tax would be 210k but their burn rate is probably 10k/M or more.

--fuxi: consider putting USD 60k to FSM to earn higher interest, but tcost a bit too high?
Find out FSM interest rate

--fuxi: div yield on cost = DY over initial cost

--fuxi: why I spend so much disposable time on personal finance, mostly ressearch and decision making? More than tech or wellness
Not completely irrational. There are rational reasons, perhaps subconscious.

-- fuxi: moat
Economic moat is popularized by Buffett and is an element of (value) stock picking

--fuxi: The most wasteful small purchases:
* basketball -- bought four so far. But there are many less visible wastes.
* board games, legos
* toys
* boy's stationeries
* kitchen utensils

Given these decisions are made consciously each time, they are much better than the invisible wastes.

Given the small sums, these wastes don't really threaten my bare-bones ffree, but they are fundamentally related to my views on deprivation, lavish etc

More damaging is buying harmful foods. We not only waste money, but also harm our health.

.. now some of the best small spends below ..
group workout
cheap exercise equipment
fancy fruits
salads
fancy dressing for raw reg
smoothie + chia
congee + chia

--jolt: car ownership in SG
I used to feel inferior to those with a car.
Now I feel I don't need a car in SG. The flexibility benefit is minimal.

Previsouly, my sense of inadequacy regarding car ownership is based on ignorance, hearsay and poor critical thinking, but such naivity is universal just like my perceived weakness in self-control. As I told Bindi, everyone is weak, but the 10-year old tanbin doesn't know it.

--jolt: basketball buying
I find it hard to accept that we bought so many and he didn't like those and insisted on a more 'suitable' one.

Look in the mirror. I had the exact same experience with tablets and with cameras. Difference -- zsms is missing in him, so is due diligence


--fuxi: jolt: pay to enter a marathon?
Mr ERE would not spend that money. Presumably he would not spend on yoga classes, packaged salad or fancy fruits.

Reality is, spending money on these things do improve my health. If you ask me to DIY at home, I know I would give up due to limited self-discipline or drive.

--fuxi: the product the company the salesman
With MIH, all three factors are equally important. First among equals is the company.

With BGC, biggest factor is the product (location)

With PeakRetail, biggest factor is the supporting companies (Shangrila + capitalLand)

With BridgeRetail, biggest factor is the product (GRR)

--fuxi: wife's allowance
make your wife feel that she could spend her money any way she wants. The 100k is her money just like her own salary. 

Trust that she won't overspend. She is not a teenager.

--fuxi: involve boy in FSM investment analysis and decision
This is more realistic, applied math

However, he has to finish his homework

--fuxi: 8% curent income assumed by Shou , is highly unrealistic.

Average 8% is possible, but chance of hitting below 4% (even negative) is perhaps 50%. I think insurers do 'smoothing' and can only deliver up to 4% current income.

Difference between 8% and 7% is huge if you rely on it as current income.

--fuxi: dbs ccard tx history: e-statatement

--fuxi: wife still feels we need higher earning because we still feel the strain of parenting due to limited financial resources.

In the U.S. I could feel the strain of long commute.

Family will probably find our home small and old. I would invest in renovation (comfort) rather than size (appreciation). We are lucky to be used to a small home.

--fuxi
I allow myself to feel superior about my burn rate and Fuller wealth, but I Don’t want to fall into the trap of benchmarking with the high earners.


--fuxi: I used to believe personal investment effort (FSM etc) is more strategic than QQ because I felt I could grow my portfolio.
Now my confidence in this effort is much lower, so I dare not put in a lot.

Also, after trying multiple investment products I realized that luck+timing is a much bigger factor than skill or (Buffett style) analysis. 

--fuxi: SRS account in DBS/posb
$15,300/Y max deposit into this account as tax exempt income. Tax saving of more than $2.4k/Y 
After 5Y (say 2030) can withdraw as 2030 income but my tax bracket in 2030 would be the lowest, because first 40k in 2030 is not taxed in Singapore.

Before 2030, During the 5Y lock-in, withdrawal penalty is 5%. Without withdrawal, we can freely invest the SRS balance into FSM not stocks.

better deposit close to end of the tax year, so most of the year I enjoy the liquidity.

Also invest some cpf OA balance into FSM

--fuxi: this 4D3N experience living in BGC is a immersion training / dress rehearsal / internship for a MYS retirement.

Now I think MYS retirement plan is based on logical reasoning + insufficient facts. It has slightly fewer uncertainties due to proximity to Singapore.

I need friends and similar people (mostly Chinese) living in the same community.

--fuxi: I need reliable history of my realized dividend yield for each of my stock
Robinhood doesn't provide it. Might be a good thing -- less distraction ...

--fuxi: For someone like Gary in his 30's, there are lots of long-term big-ticket items weighing on the mind
* kids education -- easily USD 1M
* provide housing for children when they turn 25 or something. Nowadays China parents take up this extra responsibility because they feel their children are hopeless to save up enough by themselves.
* medical -- major event or long-term care
* inflation in China

Since there's no reliable estimates on these bit-ticket costs, they tend to feel their "worries/burdens" are real.

-- fuxi: allocation between stocks, ETF and mutual funds
Rebecca said many people among her clients (and also her own parents) allocate more to mutual funds than stocks. Why? distraction, obsession, and volatility.

For U.S. market, I don't like mutual funds due to annual fees.

I asked about index ETF and she had nothing bad to say. I think for U.S. market, ETF is the default choice.

--fuxi jolt: jeju green-tea chocolate
2019 summer my family was one of thousands of turists at a famous chocolate "museum" on jeju island.

The building, the decor was exquisite. Perhaps so was the chocolate but I only had the leftover bit from my daughter's portion.

There were long queues to buy a chocolate ball for about USD 5.

At such horrible $cost + tcost + ccost, you get a real savory experience, right? Well, not in my case. Greentea always ranks as one of my least favorate chocolate flavors, even though this particular rendition was probably a bit more appealing. 

So I didn't join the queue. 

I guess my kids really enjoyed joining the queue for something supposed to be exciting... They don't know what they really enjoy. 

How about buying a high-floor apartment? High $cost and also access tcost but I don't get anything meaningful.
How about buying a quiet suburb home without public transport connectivity?
