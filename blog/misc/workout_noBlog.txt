-- fuxi or update which one?
I attended UrbanDen(beneath CIMB) yoga class with 20 other students, the first big yoga class in a year.

-- fuxi: why I envy those JPM5600 runners?
I shared with Jason. Subconsciously, I am relying on my performance number to prove to myself (and others) that I'm able to defy aging, and my body's overall fitness is comparable to those 30+. 

CAD revelation is a stark indication of aging of my heart arteries. ( My heart and other organ are still young and bealthy. ) I find it hard to accept that aging has taken place so fast.

The JPM5600 will not be a usable proof going forward.

In terms of my body flexibility, EDyw, energy level, eyesight, speed coding,,, I have noticed aging signs for years. What's different this time round? Well, CAD has a host of lifelong implications. I'm grieving my losses more than EDyw or earlier.
