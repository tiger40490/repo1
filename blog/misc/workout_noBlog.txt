-- fuxi or update which one?
I attended UrbanDen(beneath CIMB) yoga class with 20 other students, the first big yoga class in a year.
Some of the students near my mat were, like deja vu, so flexible as to put me to shame. 

.. Sinking feeling. 
If you have been working out on CRE, strength, etc but neglected flexibility, you are bound to hit a sinking feeling .. left behind.

Quality of life.

Suppose you go to a developing country where everyone you see is slim, mobile, able-bodied, and flexible, you may hit a sinking feeling like -- In the grand scheme of things, how valuable is your net worth?
Concrete example -- YY.Tao has an enviable net worth, but complained about his knee condition. As we age, such conditions are less likely to improve and recover.

-- fuxi: why I envy those JPM5600 runners?
I shared with Jason. Subconsciously, I am relying on my performance number to prove to myself (and others) that I'm able to defy aging, and my body's overall fitness is comparable to those 30+. 

CAD revelation is a stark indication of aging of my heart arteries. ( My heart and other organ are still young and bealthy. ) I find it hard to accept that aging has taken place so fast.

The JPM5600 will not be a usable proof going forward.

In terms of my body flexibility, EDyw, energy level, eyesight, speed coding,,, I have noticed aging signs for years. What's different this time round? Well, CAD has a host of lifelong implications. I'm grieving my losses more than EDyw or earlier.

Many (not enough to become consensus) studies find that to build muscle strength/endurance,
light-weight x [20->30] reps can be as effective as heavy-weight x [5-12] reps

-- fuxi: I guess competition drives down the price
Aura yoga: $55 for 10D unlimited. Good for when I return to office
-- fuxi: learn (on video) the basics of air-boxing to add fun to jogging. 
-- fuxi: the MLP monitor in Room2 can become a hindrance to the more-standing initiative. Detach it at times.

--fuxi: jogging, not yoga, gives me the confidence that I can be avialble for my son for many years.
Basically cardio wellness is the main concern.

To a lesser extent, yoga also improves my long-term wellness.

jogging is a great wellness hobby. Compared to yoga, swimming etc, jogging routine is much more "flexible"  -- Requires fewer facilities, therefore, no timing restrictions when in the mood.

--fuxi: for a retired athelete, the lifelong wellness depends on the lifestyle in post-retirement.

Most visible lifestyle factor is each person's BMI profile.
