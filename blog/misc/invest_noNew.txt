--fuxi: consider putting USD 60k to FSM to earn higher interest, but tcost a bit too high?
Find out FSM interest rate

--fuxi: div yield on cost = DY over initial cost

--fuxi: why I spend so much disposable time on personal finance, mostly ressearch and decision making? More than tech or wellness
Not completely irrational. There are rational reasons, perhaps subconscious.

--fuxi: consider transferring $1k OA -> SA, but this would reduce my investable amount

-- fuxi: moat
Economic moat is popularized by Buffett and is an element of (value) stock picking

--fuxi: The most wasteful small purchases:
* basketball -- bought four so far. But there are many less visible wastes.
* board games, legos
* toys
* boy's stationeries
* kitchen utensils

Given these decisions are made consciously each time, they are much better than the invisible wastes.

Given the small sums, these wastes don't really threaten my bare-bones ffree, but they are fundamentally related to my views on deprivation, lavish etc

More damaging is buying harmful foods. We not only waste money, but also harm our health.

.. now some of the best small spends below ..
group workout
cheap exercise equipment
fancy fruits
salads
fancy dressing for raw reg
smoothie + chia
congee + chia

--jolt: car ownership in SG
I used to feel inferior to those with a car.
Now I feel I don't need a car in SG. The flexibility benefit is minimal.

Previsouly, my sense of inadequacy regarding car ownership is based on ignorance, hearsay and poor critical thinking, but such naivity is universal just like my perceived weakness in self-control. As I told Bindi, everyone is weak, but the 10-year old tanbin doesn't know it.

--jolt: basketball buying
I find it hard to accept that we bought so many and he didn't like those and insisted on a more 'suitable' one.

Look in the mirror. I had the exact same experience with tablets and with cameras. Difference -- zsms is missing in him, so is due diligence


--fuxi: jolt: pay to enter a marathon?
Mr ERE would not spend that money. Presumably he would not spend on yoga classes, packaged salad or fancy fruits.

Reality is, spending money on these things do improve my health. If you ask me to DIY at home, I know I would give up due to limited self-discipline or drive.

--fuxi: the product the company the salesman
With MIH, all three factors are equally important. First among equals is the company.

With BGC, biggest factor is the product (location)

With PeakRetail, biggest factor is the supporting companies (Shangrila + capitalLand)

With BridgeRetail, biggest factor is the product (GRR)

--fuxi: wife's allowance
make your wife feel that she could spend her money any way she wants. The 100k is her money just like her own salary. 

Trust that she won't overspend. She is not a teenager.

--fuxi: involve boy in FSM investment analysis and decision
This is more realistic, applied math

However, he has to finish his homework

--fuxi: 8% curent income assumed by Shou , is highly unrealistic.

Average 8% is possible, but chance of hitting below 4% (even negative) is perhaps 50%. I think insurers do 'smoothing' and can only deliver up to 4% current income.

Difference between 8% and 7% is huge if you rely on it as current income.

--fuxi: dbs ccard tx history: e-statatement

--fuxi: wife still feels we need higher earning because we still feel the strain of parenting due to limited financial resources.

In the U.S. I could feel the strain of long commute.

Family will probably find our home small and old. I would invest in renovation (comfort) rather than size (appreciation). We are lucky to be used to a small home.

--fuxi
I allow myself to feel superior about my burn rate and Fuller wealth, but I Donâ€™t want to fall into the trap of benchmarking with the high earners.

--sugg: transfer some 1k from OA to SA just to live through it.
Ask CPF to compute the additional interest earned each year
Can do this during lunch break

--fuxi: I used to believe personal investment effort (FSM etc) is more strategic than QQ because I felt I could grow my portfolio.
Now my confidence in this effort is much lower, so I dare not put in a lot.

Also, after trying multiple investment products I realized that luck+timing is a much bigger factor than skill or (Buffett style) analysis. 

--fuxi: SRS account in DBS/posb
$15,300/Y max deposit into this account as tax exempt income. Tax saving of more than $2.4k/Y 
After 5Y (say 2030) can withdraw as 2030 income but my tax bracket in 2030 would be the lowest, because first 40k in 2030 is not taxed in Singapore.

Before 2030, During the 5Y lock-in, withdrawal penalty is 5%. Without withdrawal, we can freely invest the SRS balance into FSM not stocks.

better deposit close to end of the tax year, so most of the year I enjoy the liquidity.

Also invest some cpf OA balance into FSM

--fuxi: this 4D3N experience living in BGC is a immersion training / dress rehearsal / internship for a MYS retirement.

Now I think MYS retirement plan is based on logical reasoning + insufficient facts. It has slightly fewer uncertainties due to proximity to Singapore.

I need friends and similar people (mostly Chinese) living in the same community.

--fuxi: I need reliable history of my realized dividend yield for each of my stock
Robinhood doesn't provide it. Might be a good thing -- less distraction ...

--fuxi: For someone like Gary in his 30's, there are lots of long-term big-ticket items weighing on the mind
* kids education -- easily USD 1M
* provide housing for children when they turn 25 or something. Nowadays China parents take up this extra responsibility because they feel their children are hopeless to save up enough by themselves.
* medical -- major event or long-term care
* inflation in China

Since there's no reliable estimates on these bit-ticket costs, they tend to feel their "worries/burdens" are real.

--fuxi:
Any high-return products not audited could be a vehicle for money laundering
The criminals are willing to pay a fee (say 22%) to wash their black money into white money. The 22% becomes profit for the investment firm so the firm can generate high return for retail investors like me.
