--fuxi: mrt manual top-up can let me feel the cahs flow

--fuxi: wife still feels we need higher earning because we still feel the strain of parenting due to limited financial resources.

In the U.S. I could feel the strain of long commute.

Family will probably find our home small and old. I would invest in renovation (comfort) rather than size (appreciation). We are lucky to be used to a small home.

--fuxi
I allow myself to feel superior about my burn rate and Fuller wealth, but I Donâ€™t want to fall into the trap of benchmarking with the high earners.

--fuxi: Ashish's INR CD 
convert SGD->INR, invest for 1Y for 7%, convert back to SGD.
cost: bank FX spread
risk: FX ~ 2% a year
tcost is very low. Just transfer $1k to Ashish

--sugg: consider investing CPF-OA balance into U.S. 
Should be able to beat 3.5%
no guilt no hurry

* If recreational amount, then too much tcost.
* If 20k, then I need to convince myself to take the plunge. I would say that long term prospect is good.

--sugg: transfer some 1k from OA to SA just to live through it.
Ask CPF to compute the additional interest earned each year
Can do this during lunch break

--fuxi: I used to believe personal investment effort (FSM etc) is more strategic than QQ because I felt I could grow my portfolio.
Now I know that my confidence in this effort is much lower than expected, so I dare not put in a lot.

Also, after trying multiple investment products I realized that luck is a much bigger factor than skill or analysis. 

--Ashish on retirement destination
Singapore is the best city for retirement, esp. for older Singapore citizens like the older me.

--fuxi: Raymond on retirement destinations
Raymond plans to stay rented in A then B then C for a year each time, perhaps including China.

Healthcare is key. If not so healthy, then better stay near home base i.e. sg.

--fuxi: SRS account in DBS/posb
$15,300/Y max deposit into this account as tax exempt income. Tax saving of more than $2.4k/Y 
After 5Y (say 2030) can withdraw as 2030 income but my tax bracket in 2030 would be the lowest, because first 40k in 2030 is not taxed in Singapore.

Before 2030, During the 5Y lock-in, withdrawal penalty is 5%. Without withdrawal, we can freely invest the SRS balance into FSM not stocks.

better deposit close to end of the tax year, so most of the year I enjoy the liquidity.

Also invest some cpf OA balance into FSM

--fuxi: this 4D3N experience living in BGC is a immersion training / dress rehearsal / internship for a MYS retirement.

Now I think MYS retirement plan is based on logical reasoning + insufficient facts. It has slightly fewer uncertainties due to proximity to Singapore.

I need friends and similar people (mostly Chinese) living in the same community.

--fuxi: I need reliable history of my realized dividend yield for each of my stock
Robinhood doesn't provide it. Might be a good thing -- less distraction ...

--fuxi: For someone like Gary in his 30's, there are lots of upcoming big-ticket items weighing on the mind
* kids education -- easily USD 1M
* provide housing for children when they turn 25 or something. Nowadays China parents take up this extra responsibility because they feel their children are hopeless to save up enough by themselves.
* medical -- major event or long-term care
* inflation in China

Since there's no reliable estimates on these bit-ticket costs, they tend to feel their "worries/burdens" are real.

--fuxi:
Any high-return products not audited could be a vehicle for money laundering
The criminals are willing to pay a fee (say 22%) to wash their black money into white money. The 22% becomes profit for the investment firm so the firm can generate high return for retail investors like me.
