BGC: more time researching less time talking

boy's math: more research, more coaching less telling
^ workout, esp. exercise corner + home + office mini-exercise

--I still beat myself up in terms of ROTI ..
* reading boy's exam papers ... doesn't help my career
* localSys .. doesn't help me keep my QQ knowledge afresh, or help maintain my sense of long-term security
* ..

I should really ask myself what are more strategic -- not QQ not coding drill not localSys. Wellness is most strategic.

QQ can help me on interviews, but wellness has more long-term benefits

I should ask what risks are higher. Perhaps IV failure is an unlikely risk, compared to PIP, overweight, inflexibility, PSLE, ... In such a scenario, i may need to accept the fading of my c++ QQ level. In fact, c# and quant already accepted. Java is a lucky case -- critical mass, slow changing question bank ...

Also some things need to be taken care of even if they require tons of low-ROTI legwork -- BGC, boy's academics...

Lastly, git-blogging is a pillar. I can't afford to cut (t-spend) on my pillars.

--I used to believe personal investment effort (FSM etc) is more strategic than QQ because I felt I could grow my portfolio.
Now I know that my confidence in this effort is much lower than expected, so I dare not put in a lot.

Also, after trying multiple investment products I realized that luck is a much bigger factor than skill or analysis. 

--important not urgent
BGC rental set-up on the legal aspect

study boy's exam results. I don't aim to improve his score, but rather take on a joint project and build teamwork.

--fuxi (jolt): In terms of roti, yoga has less transient, more lasting benefits than most "endeavors" including most tech xx .. churn and fashion.

In contrast, software tech is like hairstyle -- what's dominant for the current decade is fashionable but not always techically superior.

--fuxi: compared to c++US days,
more time on boy -- far more than half my spare time
more distractions at home
more time talking to wife ... good. Was too little 
huge amount of time on family outing ... need to work on tcost and roti. 
less time on food preparation, thanks to maid + wife
less time on commute
more hours in office

--fuxi: One of the biggest challenge during this hibernation -- very few proven, effective usages of precious personal time including plenty of leaves
* (safe default) more time in office to capture the absorbency, extend the honeymoon
* weight management? demands time and energy
* more frq exercise
* c++ critical mass maintenance, but without IV :(
? boy's academics? potentially frustrating
? QQ+zbs on cloud
? per investment, esp. on Robinhood?
? quant refresh?

--why no CIV? +ve Feedback loop is now broken
Out-ranked by
* parenting including boy's math. Detached supervision is hard. 
* family time? what is it?
* ramp up -- driven by respect, self-respect, honeymoon
* yoga

How about mini sessions like yoga, skip-rope, chin-up?

--fuxi: important but not urgent:
flexibility, bone density
coding drill -- I feel i won't forget the past problems.
c++ critical mass maintenance
