--new jolt:
i have been utterly unfair in my assessment of family-time utilization. 
* yoga -- considered not burn and low ROTI... Actually extremely hard. Actually more strategic than the coding drill etc, 
* work out with kids -- considered not burn and low ROTI (too much wasted time) .. Actually tough, and builds family bound. Arguably no less strategic than QQ
* strength training -- considered not burn, not hard enough.
* prepare math worksheet -- considered not burn, not hard enough, not strategic, not related to my career
* review zbs -- considered not burn not IV-relevant.
* review GTD -- considered not burn not IV-relevant.
* review QQ -- considered not burn and not strategic
* bring boy out shopping as reward for him -- considered high tcost low ROTI but extremely important to his +/-ve feedback loop 

Overall, I was fixated on materialistic ROTI and self-discipline over the lazy self

--Give yourself time
As Martin Thompson put it, time is the most important factor.

give yourself time to experience yoga. Find your own practice. Could be totally different from other people's practice

give yourself time to understand your own kids. Tough process. Non-trivial.

Give yourself time to experience diet and calorie restriction. Tough for everyone. Lifelong learning. Find your own system.

--fuxi: increase/reduce time allocation
^ proj and localSys xx
? QQ + coding drill
^ boy's arithmetic drill - preparation
? boy's arithmetic drill - face time ... too high
^ shopping with boy as a reward
^ meimei
^ exercise corner + home + office mini-exercise
? yoga
^ mini stretches
v stadium - tcost
v nutritional research
v personal finance as recreation
? blogging to manage everything
? call to parents -- need grandpa's support
v discussion with friends
v recording weight measurements

--fuxi: compared to c++US days,
more time on boy -- far more than half my spare time
more distractions at home
more time talking to wife ... good. Was too little 
huge amount of time on family outing ... need to work on tcost and roti. 
less time on food preparation, thanks to maid + wife
less time on commute
more hours in office


--new: q3SG phase t-utilization in contrast to this hibernation:
History is a mirror

too much time spent with boy.. extremely low roti. 
Need to be more calculating on tcost. Beware of long trips but boy really appreciates it.
msfm? low roti. Huge tcost like 10~15h/week per subject
personal investment? too much time on fsm + oanda
extra time in office? too much non-work
yoga? insufficient positive feedback, too much physical pain, slightly too much $cost pressure
(how do I improve yoga this time round?)

--biggest challenge during this hibernation -- very few proven, effective usages of precious personal time including plenty of leaves
* (safe default) more time in office to capture the absorbency, extend the honeymoon
* weight management? demands time and energy
* more frq exercise
* c++ critical mass maintenance, but without IV :(
? boy's academics? potentially frustrating
? QQ+zbs on cloud
? per investment, esp. on Robinhood?
? quant refresh?

--why no CIV? +ve Feedback loop is now broken
Out-ranked by
* parenting including boy's math. Detached supervision is hard. 
* family time? what is it?
* ramp up -- driven by respect, self-respect, honeymoon
* yoga

How about mini sessions like yoga, skip-rope, chin-up?

--important but not urgent:
flexibility
coding drill
c++ critical mass maintenance
