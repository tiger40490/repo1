--fuxi: compared to c++US days,
more time on boy -- far more than half my spare time
more distractions at home
more time talking to wife ... good. Was too little 
huge amount of time on family outing ... need to work on tcost and roti. 
less time on food preparation, thanks to maid + wife
less time on commute
more hours in office

--new: I am so used to measuring roti in terms of gz including tech xx and work projects, but i was always philosophical about income

As I age, it is fundamental to increase the weightage on wellness, parenting, taking care of grandparents, marriage ...

For wellness, the huge effort may not produce visible effect !

As to parenting efforts, again huge tcost but slow improvement

--new: q3SG phase t-utilization in contrast to this hibernation: 
too much time spent with boy.. extremely low roti. Need to be more calculating on tcost. Beware of long trips.
msfm? low roti. Huge tcost like 10~15h/week per subject
personal investment? too much time on fsm + oanda
extra time in office? too much non-work
yoga? insufficient positive feedback, too much physical pain, slightly too much $cost pressure
(how do I improve yoga this time round?)

--a month into my hibernation, my time (i.e. laser, O2) still feels so precious
priorities? 

new job -- localSys, respect, ...
help my son's math exams
blogging -- analysis and juggling, like OS scheduler, competing with the tasks being scheduled
LG-recreation: time with meimei
LG-recreation: per-investment
LG2: discussion with friends. Email is far more efficient
LG2: discussion with grandparents
LG2: coding drill, 
LG2: c++maintenance? Lucky I could rely on the critical mass
LG2: yoga + workout? mini-workout is very time-efficient
+ food preparation: maid is great time-saver
+ commute is a huge time-saver
+ git-blogging + smemo-blogging whenever and wherever I have the inspiration

--biggest challenge during this hibernation -- very few proven, effective usages of precious personal time including plenty of leaves
* (safe default) more time in office to capture the absorbency, extend the honeymoon
* weight management? demands time and energy
* more frq exercise
* c++ critical mass maintenance, but without IV :(
? boy's academics? potentially frustrating
? QQ+zbs on cloud
? per investment, esp. on Robinhood?
? quant refresh?

--why no CIV? +ve Feedback loop is now broken
Out-ranked by
* parenting including boy's math. Detached supervision is hard. 
* family time? what is it?
* ramp up -- driven by respect, self-respect, honeymoon
* yoga

How about mini sessions like yoga, skip-rope, chin-up?

--important but not urgent:
flexibility
coding drill
c++ critical mass maintenance
