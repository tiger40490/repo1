--after grandparents come over, family distraction is now a full-blown assault
I feel frusrated and disappointed many times a day.

* hardware breakdowns
* questions on everything in the house
* heated discussions on boy's PSLE. Real stress real strain. Real risk of affecting my work
* health conditions 
* frequent conflicts with grandma
* degradation of wellness
* degradation of concentration during work hours
* i often feel the need to go home early. But I should capture the localSys mood

I thought grandparents could reduce the distraction due to boy's studies, but I think this distractions is actually worsening. I probably have no one to blame but myself.

..coping with the distractions when entire family is here
luckily office is nearby and work hours are flexible
more time in office on ... localSys or QQ or blogging

--fuxi: increase/reduce time allocation
= blogging to manage everything
= investment
^ mini-exercise in exercise corner + home + office 
v stadium, swimming, yoga studio - rewarding but tcost

^ proj and localSys xx? Capture i.e. increase if in the mood
= QQ + coding drill? Capture

boy's math: more research, more coaching less telling
^ boy's arithmetic drill - preparation
v boy's arithmetic drill - face time ... too high

--fuxi: important not urgent
flexibility, bone density
coding drill -- I feel i won't forget the past problems.
c++ critical mass maintenance

--fuxi (jolt): In terms of roti, yoga has less transient, more lasting benefits than most "endeavors" including most tech xx .. churn and fashion.

In contrast, software tech is like hairstyle -- what's dominant for the current decade is fashionable but not always techically superior.

--fuxi: compared to c++US days,
more time on boy -- far more than half my spare time
more distractions at home
more time talking to wife ... good. Was too little 
huge amount of time on family outing ... need to work on tcost and roti. 
less time on food preparation, thanks to maid + wife
less time on commute
more hours in office

--fuxi: One of the biggest challenges during this hibernation -- very few proven, effective usages of precious personal time including plenty of leaves
* (safe default) more time in office to capture the absorbency, extend the honeymoon
* weight management? demands time and absorbency, and frustrating
* more frq exercise
* c++ critical mass maintenance, but without IV :(
? boy's academics? frustrating,,, losing my cool
? per investment, esp. on Robinhood?
