Maslow explored perception of reality in self-actualization. 

one of the deepest and most wide-spread misperceptions is the invalid peer group -- wrong distro.
Brank is something I don't need to feel completely satisfied with my life.

A related misperceptions is top schools.

The most poisonous misperception is PIP -- one person's judgemtn of me (PIP) overrides all other assessments. In fact, I received PIP only in Macq. The Stirt and GS warnings were temporary as I officially recovered

Another deep-rooted misperception is 'burn' hours in my spare time.
This prejudiced perception/framework has long dominated my weekend planning, my self-review, ... but is it wholistic or even fair? I think this is like focusing on 1) height and 2) education in the China dating advertisements.

A minor misperception is the importance of raw celery. I think the evidence is very limited to suppport that it's that extremely valuable.
So if it tastes so awful why must I push myself hard to eat it?

--weekends: limiting factor is not spare time (like O2) but absorbency
inufficient absorbency for localSys
inufficient absorbency for jogging, stretch
inufficient absorbency for coding drill

Jolt: Before I scold ah-boy about his absorbency deficiency, look in the mirror.

--fuxi: more spare time (including leaves) can "buy" me
lower-body flexibility
cardio fitness
more therapeutic, reflective blogging

--after grandparents come over, family distraction is now a full-blown assault
I feel frustrated and disappointed many times a day.

* hardware breakdowns
* questions on everything in the house
* heated discussions on boy's PSLE. Real stress real strain. Real risk of affecting my work
* health conditions 
* frequent conflicts with grandma
* degradation of wellness
* degradation of concentration during work hours
* i often feel the need to go home early. But I should capture the localSys mood

I thought grandparents could reduce the distraction due to boy's studies, but I think this distractions is actually worsening. I probably have no one to blame but myself.

..coping with the distractions when entire family is here
luckily office is nearby and work hours are flexible
more time in office on ... localSys or QQ or blogging

--fuxi: increase/reduce time allocation
= blogging to manage everything
= investment
^ mini-exercise in exercise corner + home + office 
v stadium, swimming, yoga studio - rewarding but tcost

^ proj and localSys xx? Capture i.e. increase if in the mood
= QQ + coding drill? Capture

boy's math: more research, more coaching less telling
^ boy's arithmetic drill - preparation
v boy's arithmetic drill - face time ... too high

--fuxi: important not urgent
flexibility, bone density
coding drill -- I feel i won't forget the past problems.
