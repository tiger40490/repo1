--new? time^absorbency..2 scarce resources
see also blogpost on absorbency domains

time is a /limiting factor/ (with a twin sister) because when I try to break through and reach the next level on something, I often hit a /ceiling/ not in terms of my capacity but in terms of time. 

That is A common experience shared by many, therefore easy to understand. The more subtle experience is the limiting factor of productive mood. 
This phrase is vague and intangible, so sometimes I speak of "motivation" -- not exactly same and still vague. 
Sometimes I speak of "absorbency" as a more specific proxy. 

Xp: I often take leave specifically to provide time for myself but usually can't achieve the expected ROTI.

xp: I took many leaves to attend an IV. The time + absorbency is a precious combination that leads to breakthrough. If I only provide time to myself, most of the time I don't achieve much in terms tech learning.

* the zone -- (as described in my email) i often need a block of uninterrupted hours. Time is clearly a necessary but insufficient condition.
* yoga -- the motivation is very rare, far fewer than jogging
* time for workout -- I often tell my friends that lack of time sounds like an excuse given the mini-workout option. Well, free time still helps a lot, but motivation is more important in this case.
* localSys -- absorbency is more rare here than coding drill, which is more rare than c++QQ which is more rare than java QQ
* face time with boy -- math practice etc.. the calm, engaged mood on both sides is very rare and precious. I tend to lose my cool even when I make time for my son.
* laptop working at train stations -- like MRT stations or 33rd St ... to capture the mood. Available time by itself is useless

--fuxi: increase/reduce time allocation
^ proj and localSys xx
^ yoga
^ boy's arithmetic drill
? nutritional research
? QQ + coding drill
v personal finance
v blogging
v call to parents

--spare time usage:
yoga
stadium
^ exercise corner + home + office mini-exercise
v coding drill
boy's math
git-blogging?
v food preparation
v emailing or meeting with friends? 
shopping with boy as a reward

--no blog: compared to c++US days,
more time on boy -- far more than half my spare time
more distractions at home
more time talking to wife ... good. Was too little 
huge amount of time on family outing ... need to work on tcost and roti. Perhaps I should come home early to exercise, study(?), blog ... (so as to reduce tcost)
less time on food preparation, thanks to maid + wife
less time on commute
more hours in office

--I am so used to measuring roti in terms of gz including tech xx and work projects

As I age, it is fundamental to increase the weightage on wellness, parenting, taking care of grandparents, marriage ...

For wellness, the huge effort may not produce visible effect !

As to parenting efforts, again huge tcost but slow improvement

--qSG phase t-utilization in contrast to this hibernation: 
yoga? insufficient positive feedback, too much physical pain, slightly too much $cost pressure
.. how do I improve this time?
too much time spent with boy.. extremely low roti. Need to be more calculating on tcost. Beware of long journey
msfm? low roti. Huge tcost like 10~15h/week per subject
per investment? too much time on fsm + oanda
extra time in office? too much non-work

--a month into my hibernation, my time (i.e. laser, O2) still feels so precious
priorities? 

new job -- localSys, respect, ...
help my son's math exams
blogging -- analysis and juggling, like OS scheduler, competing with the tasks being scheduled
LG-recreation: time with meimei
LG-recreation: per-investment
LG2: discussion with friends. Email is far more efficient
LG2: discussion with grandparents
LG2: coding drill, 
LG2: c++maintenance? Lucky I could rely on the critical mass
LG2: yoga + workout? mini-workout is very time-efficient
+ food preparation: maid is great time-saver
+ commute is a huge time-saver
+ git-blogging + smemo-blogging whenever and wherever I have the inspiration

--biggest challenge during this hibernation -- very few proven, effective usages of precious personal time including plenty of leaves
* (safe default) more time in office to capture the absorbency, extend the honeymoon
* weight management? demands time and energy
* more frq exercise
* c++ critical mass maintenance, but without IV :(
? boy's academics? potentially frustrating
? QQ+zbs on cloud
? per investment, esp. on Robinhood?
? quant refresh?

--why no CIV? +ve Feedback loop is now broken
Out-ranked by
* parenting including boy's math. Detached supervision is hard. 
* family time? what is it?
* ramp up -- driven by respect, self-respect, honeymoon
* yoga

How about mini sessions like yoga, skip-rope, chin-up?

--important but not urgent:
flexibility
coding drill
c++ critical mass maintenance
