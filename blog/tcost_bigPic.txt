--fuxi: In terms of roti, yoga has less transient, more lasting benefits than most "endeavors" including most tech xx -- churn and fashion.

In contrast, software tech is like hairstyle -- what's dominant for the current decade is fashionable but not always techically superior.
--fuxi: increase/reduce time allocation
^ orgro tech xx, in the long run
^ coatching boy
^ workout, esp. exercise corner + home + office mini-exercise
^ wellness research, in the long run
^ proj and localSys xx
? QQ + coding drill
^ boy's arithmetic drill - preparation
? boy's arithmetic drill - face time ... too high
^ shopping with boy as a reward
^ meimei
? yoga
^ mini stretches
v stadium - tcost
v nutritional research
v personal finance as recreation
? blogging to manage everything
? call to parents -- need grandpa's support
v discussion with friends
v recording weight measurements

--fuxi: compared to c++US days,
more time on boy -- far more than half my spare time
more distractions at home
more time talking to wife ... good. Was too little 
huge amount of time on family outing ... need to work on tcost and roti. 
less time on food preparation, thanks to maid + wife
less time on commute
more hours in office

--new: q3SG phase t-utilization 
History is a mirror

too much time spent with boy.. extremely low roti. 
Need to be more calculating on tcost. Beware of long trips but boy really appreciates it.
msfm? low roti. Huge tcost like 10~15h/week per subject
personal investment? too much time on fsm + oanda
extra time in office? too much non-work
yoga? insufficient positive feedback, too much physical pain, slightly too much $cost pressure
(how do I improve yoga this time round?)

--One of the biggest challenge during this hibernation -- very few proven, effective usages of precious personal time including plenty of leaves
* (safe default) more time in office to capture the absorbency, extend the honeymoon
* weight management? demands time and energy
* more frq exercise
* c++ critical mass maintenance, but without IV :(
? boy's academics? potentially frustrating
? QQ+zbs on cloud
? per investment, esp. on Robinhood?
? quant refresh?

--why no CIV? +ve Feedback loop is now broken
Out-ranked by
* parenting including boy's math. Detached supervision is hard. 
* family time? what is it?
* ramp up -- driven by respect, self-respect, honeymoon
* yoga

How about mini sessions like yoga, skip-rope, chin-up?

--fuxi: important but not urgent:
flexibility, bone density
coding drill -- I feel i won't forget the past problems.
c++ critical mass maintenance
