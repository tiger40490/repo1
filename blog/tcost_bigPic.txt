Consider JackZ and Raymond's situations. At my age and (my economic) level, what endeavors (spaceshuttle) are really strategic?
1) wellness lifestyle improvements like yoga, sustainable diet habits, BMI
2) dev-till-70 accu, plowback,,, including QQ and CIV
? academic parenting? No. I prioritize motivation, bonding, coaching 
? learn div-stock as diversification for my rental properties
? learn time-saving devices and techniques including commute, blogging

--fuxi: after grandparents come over, family distraction is now a full-blown assault
I feel frustrated and disappointed many times a day.

* hardware breakdowns
* questions on everything in the house
* heated discussions on boy's PSLE. Real stress real strain. Real risk of affecting my work
* health conditions 
* frequent conflicts with grandma
* degradation of wellness
* degradation of concentration during work hours
* i often feel the need to go home early. But I should capture the localSys mood

I thought grandparents could reduce the distraction due to boy's studies, but I think this distractions is actually worsening. I probably have no one to blame but myself.

--fuxi: increase/reduce time allocation
= blogging to manage everything
= investment
^ mini-exercise in exercise corner + home + office 
v stadium, swimming, yoga studio - rewarding but tcost

^ proj and localSys xx? Capture i.e. increase if in the mood
= QQ + coding drill? Capture

boy's math: more research, more coaching less telling
^ boy's arithmetic drill - preparation
v boy's arithmetic drill - face time ... too high
