-- update blogpost on more/less?
Fact: for some of us, we always feel insufficient allocation to this or that aspects of our life. Ocassionally, we feel some overallocation, too.

Our allocation decision is dynamic, fluid and largely run by System1, therefore never perfect.
I mean Allocation of time + System2 resources [attention, energy, absorbency...]

I feel the need to constantly review our past allocation decisions over short and long histories.

The higher ground I want to push toward is a situation where I find very few items constantly starved/underserved, and ideally the "starvation" is more evenly spread out to all areas.
On this higher ground, I would really remember a few success stories of adjustment. The success stories empower me to endeavor to adjust my allocation strategy, rather than powerless guilt.

At my age and my level of ffree, why do I still worry about coblood waste, and too much idle time? zqbx is one of the 4 def@success

Time wasted in pain, or other unintended wastes of time are always regrettable and should be minimized. 

Planned down time (idle time) can be free of pain. 
To me, down time is a prolonged period of doing nothing, free of extraneous stimuations. Boredom can be good, as a BBC program reported.
I guess down time can be a deeper recharge but today I will assume this deeper recharge doesn't work for everyone.

I think down time is not bad for some retirees and some younger people. So far, I have limited appreciation for down time.  Jacob of ERE pointed out the "freedom TO" challenge. 90% of the time, I still have goals, and purposes and I still push myself towards them.

One growing purpose is the need to live longer for my kids. (Longevity requires long-term effort, practice and time.) I feel I can add value to their lives. If I live longer, I can better control my surplus assets and decide how to use it to help my children and possibly their children.

-- fuxi: with cash flow, I constantly look out for ways to Reduce waste
with time usage, I constantly look out for ways to Increase productive use. 

Why the difference? You can't slow down or store the flow of time. You can only make better use (a bit more) of the 24H given to you each day.
 
--fuxi: during circuit breaker, family distraction is now a full-blown assault
I feel frustrated and disappointed many times a day.

* hardware breakdowns
* questions on everything in the house
* heated discussions on boy's PSLE. Real stress real strain. Real risk of affecting my work
* health conditions 
* frequent conflicts with grandma
* degradation of wellness
* degradation of concentration during work hours
* i often feel the need to go home early. But I should capture the localSys mood

I thought grandparents could reduce my distraction stemming from boy's studies, but I think this distractions is actually worsening. I probably have no one to blame but myself.

-- fuxi: if I continue to negelect workout, coding drill, QQ,,, for too long, zsms would likely grow,
even though I put in more hours into my projects
even though I spend more time with grandparents
even though I spend more time with kids

I feel these t-spends are more important but doesn't meet my "burn" standard -- roti + self-discipline

weekend roti is a counter-productive concept esp. in terms of family time and babysitting boy -- high tcost low visible ROTI.
