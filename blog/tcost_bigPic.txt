Consider JackZ and Raymond's situations. At my age and (economic) level, what endeavors (space shuttle) are most strategic?
1) wellness lifestyle improvements like yoga, sustainable diet habits, BMI
2) dev-till-70 accu, plowback,,, including QQ and CIV
? academic parenting? No. I prioritize motivation, bonding, coaching 
? learn div-stock as diversification for my rental properties
? learn time-saving devices and techniques including commute, blogging

--fuxi: more spare time (including leaves) can "buy" me
lower-body flexibility
cardio fitness
more therapeutic, reflective blogging

However, limiting factor is not only spare time (like O2) but absorbency
inufficient absorbency for localSys
inufficient absorbency for jogging, stretch
inufficient absorbency for coding drill

Jolt: Before I scold ah-boy about his absorbency deficiency, look in the mirror.

--after grandparents come over, family distraction is now a full-blown assault
I feel frustrated and disappointed many times a day.

* hardware breakdowns
* questions on everything in the house
* heated discussions on boy's PSLE. Real stress real strain. Real risk of affecting my work
* health conditions 
* frequent conflicts with grandma
* degradation of wellness
* degradation of concentration during work hours
* i often feel the need to go home early. But I should capture the localSys mood

I thought grandparents could reduce the distraction due to boy's studies, but I think this distractions is actually worsening. I probably have no one to blame but myself.

..coping with the distractions when entire family is here
luckily office is nearby and work hours are flexible
more time in office on ... localSys or QQ or blogging

--fuxi: increase/reduce time allocation
= blogging to manage everything
= investment
^ mini-exercise in exercise corner + home + office 
v stadium, swimming, yoga studio - rewarding but tcost

^ proj and localSys xx? Capture i.e. increase if in the mood
= QQ + coding drill? Capture

boy's math: more research, more coaching less telling
^ boy's arithmetic drill - preparation
v boy's arithmetic drill - face time ... too high

--fuxi: important not urgent
flexibility, bone density
coding drill -- I feel i won't forget the past problems.
