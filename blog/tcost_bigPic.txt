--no blog: compared to c++US days,
more time on boy -- far more than half my spare time
more distractions at home
more time talking to wife
more time on family outing
less time on food preparation, thanks to maid + wife
less time on commute
more hours in office

--qSG phase t-utilization in contrast to this hibernation: 
yoga? insufficient positive feedback, too much physical pain, slightly too much $cost pressure
.. how do I improve this time?
too much time spent with boy.. extremely low roti. Need to be more calculating on tcost. Beware of long journey
msfm? low roti. Huge tcost like 10~15h/week per subject
per investment? too much time on fsm + oanda
extra time in office? too much non-work

--a month into my hibernation, my time (i.e. laser, O2) still feels so precious
priorities? 

new job -- localSys, respect, ...
help my son's math exams
blogging -- analysis and juggling, like OS scheduler, competing with the tasks being scheduled
LG-recreation: time with meimei
LG-recreation: per-investment
LG2: discussion with friends. Email is far more efficient
LG2: discussion with grandparents
LG2: coding drill, 
LG2: c++maintenance? Lucky I could rely on the critical mass
LG2: yoga + workout? mini-workout is very time-efficient
+ food preparation: maid is great time-saver
+ commute is a huge time-saver
+ git-blogging + smemo-blogging whenever and wherever I have the inspiration

--biggest challenge during this hibernation -- very few proven, effective usages of precious personal time including plenty of leaves
* (safe default) more time in office to capture the absorbency, extend the honeymoon
* weight management? demands time and energy
* more frq exercise
* c++ critical mass maintenance, but without IV :(
? boy's academics? potentially frustrating
? QQ+zbs on cloud
? per investment, esp. on Robinhood?
? quant refresh?

--why no CIV? +ve Feedback loop is now broken
Out-ranked by
* parenting including boy's math. Detached supervision is hard. 
* family time? what is it?
* ramp up -- driven by respect, self-respect, honeymoon
* yoga

How about mini sessions like yoga, skip-rope, chin-up?

--important but not urgent:
flexibility
coding drill
c++ critical mass maintenance
