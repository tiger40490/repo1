--if I continue to negelect workout, coding drill, QQ,,, for too long, zsms would likely grow,

even though I put in more hours into my projects
even though I spend more time with grandparents
even though I spend more time with kids

I feel these t-spends are more important but doesn't meet my "burn" standard -- roti + self-discipline

weekend roti is a counter-productive concept esp. in terms of family time and babysitting boy -- high tcost low visible ROTI.

Consider JackZ and Raymond's situations. At my age and (my economic) level, what endeavors (spaceshuttle) are really strategic?
1) wellness lifestyle improvements like yoga, sustainable diet habits, BMI
2) dev-till-70 accu, plowback,,, including QQ and CIV
? academic parenting? No. I prioritize motivation, bonding, coaching 
? learn div-stock as diversification for my rental properties
? learn time-saving devices and techniques including commute, blogging

--fuxi: after grandparents come over, family distraction is now a full-blown assault
I feel frustrated and disappointed many times a day.

* hardware breakdowns
* questions on everything in the house
* heated discussions on boy's PSLE. Real stress real strain. Real risk of affecting my work
* health conditions 
* frequent conflicts with grandma
* degradation of wellness
* degradation of concentration during work hours
* i often feel the need to go home early. But I should capture the localSys mood

I thought grandparents could reduce the distraction due to boy's studies, but I think this distractions is actually worsening. I probably have no one to blame but myself.

--fuxi: increase/reduce time allocation
= blogging to manage everything
= investment
^ mini-exercise in exercise corner + home + office 
v stadium, swimming, yoga studio - rewarding but tcost

^ proj and localSys xx? Capture i.e. increase if in the mood
= QQ + coding drill? Capture

boy's math: more research, more coaching less telling
^ boy's arithmetic drill - preparation
v boy's arithmetic drill - face time ... too high
