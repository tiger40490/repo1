I have heard the conventional and expert advice for years -- make school-age children more independent.
Now I think it may fail miserably for a few percent of the kids. My son could be one of them. 

I (grandpa too) feel he is many years younger than other 11-year olds, in terms of academic motivation and self-discipline. Such motivation requires a form of long-term vision. Some young kids lack any long-term vision. They can't see beyond the next week.

Therefore, grandpa now advocates
* use outside tuitions
* parents to baby-sit him for his studies

The P6 increased workload demands significant effort ,,, usually from the pupil, but in this case, from parents (and tutor) since dabao can't find the /energy/ from within.
