Hi Ashish,

I will find my H1b employers and forward you the email threads.

Your suggestion: deadlift .. bold idea, worth trying.

My suggestion: get regular CAD screening on treadmill, if your cholesterol or family history are concerning. Very active people (like marathon runners) can also have CAD or get heart attack.

My suggestion: avoid distance learning if you embark on quant program. (I'm biased.)
reason 1: my experience shows me that I learn more by interacting with classmates in-person. Similarly, the tutorials are conducted onsite, and I learn more.
reason 2: distance learning qualification is less credible. Some employers may even ask "How did you work and study at the same time? How was campus life? Did you try any overseas exchange program?"

You gave me several eye-openers about my next job change (when I lose current job)

Small firms in Singapore .. Thanks for sharing your experience. I agree that they are less selective, less strict in hiring.

Quant dev roles .. I hear you that quant dev roles are growing in local job market. This could be a promising green field for me when I change job in Singapore. I'm good at math, with a branded qualification.

Pay cut .. just like you, I don't mind low salary, as low as 3k/M (as my friend Jason suggested). You are right to point out that a subsequent employer may offer me no more than 15% increment over 3k/M... Well, I will take a calculated risk. Life is an adventure. As you said, I'm kinda "financially free", and I have the U.S. option.
