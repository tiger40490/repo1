sacrifice conventional success for healthy longevity

Hi Zeng Sheng,

A few years ago, in my WeChat voice message, I was advocating a form of a minimalist lifestyle for healthy longevity. This lifestyle may not give me healthier longevity, but it gives me a better probability. Living a healthy long life is both art and science, rather than precisely programmed as in software. 
•	eating less (below half the "average" amount for a Chinese adult), but eating slowly to savor the food
•	less tasty food.. watch out for over-indulgence
•	frequent workout .. pushing (hard) towards 5 "active days" a week. Each person must define what amount of workout qualifies as an active day.
•	.. For many busy adults, 3 to 6 mini-workouts can add up to an active day.
•	walk and bike more, drive less; take stairs more
•	stand more, sit less, whereas cross-legged sitting (popular in yoga) is a form of stretch.
•	more sleep .. like 7-9 hours
•	more intimacy with a single sexual partner. Aim at life-enhancing intimacy, not over-indulgence.
•	more expressive writing .. I find it life-enhancing
•	probably more meditation (including praying and yoga) .. am inexperienced
•	reduce distractive screen time; more audio or radio, and reading on hardcopy
So far, I have excluded many mega factors (poverty, environment, healthcare..) since my focus here is "lifestyle" for healthy longevity. Now we come to the controversial part -- I aim lower on most of the conventional "success" endeavors. (These are the focus of Singapore's speakers/trainers and also Singapore's wealth banking industry.) 
•	I aim to earn enough (from work or nonwork) to support my family and my simple lifestyle, but not keep earning more and more to satisfy endless greed
•	I don't envy high responsibilities at work including many leadership roles
•	top schools and a branded degree .. not directly relevant to healthy longevity. In my experience, these "achievements" do, to some extent, enhance life chances including healthy longevity. Not a deciding factor in most lives I have seen.
•	lucrative jobs in top companies .. are nice but not necessary 
•	home size .. I always feel Singaporean Chinese tend to want bigger and newer homes. Not necessary to healthy longevity
•	fame and influence .. not necessary for healthy longevity 
•	finer things in life .. are usually "lifestyle creeps" in my view, and not necessary for healthy longevity
•	I don't aim to vacation in many countries ..  not necessary for (my idea of) healthy longevity 
I recently took a quick look at Paul Allen's life (Steve Jobs is another example). He co-founded Microsoft and had serious cancers since 29, and died at 65. He achieved his goals in a wide range of meaningful endeavors, but do I want to trade place with him? For a few years perhaps, but not for good. 

I think 庄子 has several gems of wisdom including one about a big useless tree. I won't discuss Zhuangzi here. I recently read [[think, fast and slow]] by the Nobel Economics winner Daniel Kahneman. Do I prefer my healthy but mediocre long life (yes it will be a long life, am sure)? Now I think it's better than Paul Allen's or Steve Jobs's lives.
