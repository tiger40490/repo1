Hi Liu Shuo,

Hope your parents are safe in Beijing and also your in-laws (in Shanghai?)

Today something reminded me of a suggestion/recommendation you gave me some years ago, when you said a teaching career might be best for my later career. You didn't say but I will assume you meant "after 55". 

I think the context was my master's program in math, so i assume you meant teaching math or CSci (Computer Science).

Many things have changed since, and I don't see a high probability (like 5%) to take up a full time teaching career by 55. 

Q: looking at the last few years, why would I want or don't want a full-time teaching career? Below are some Yes/No factors.

[yes factor] demand .. Since 10 years ago, demand for CSci and math education has been rising, and I have the basic credentials to teach at high-school or associate-degree levels. My wife is professionally trained in pre-school Chinese, and we discussed running a Chinese language school in the U.S. 

[yes factor] interest .. I have a bit of interest in teaching Chinese, math or programming. I like it better than cleaner job, driver job, retail sales, full-time volunteering,,,

[no-factor] workload .. workload, intensity, mental stress level ... have improved over 5Y for the_SWE_jobs_I_focus_on. In some SWE jobs, I only work less than half the time in a year. I often get close to no work for a month. Crucially, I always can get my job done, on time, with quality. For this reason, I have less motivation to change career.

[no-factor] interviews .. are still within my range for the_SWE_jobs_I_focus_on. (Obviously many SWE interviews are beyond my abilities such as architect, team lead, or bay area $300k SWE jobs.) By 55, I think I can keep up.

[no-factor] tech churn .. has improved significantly over 20Y for the_SWE_jobs_I_focus_on. Churn was a slow-n-steady killer in the interview game and on the job. We were brainwashed that "If you don't upgrade to new technology (and lose your heavy investment in older technology), then you couldn't survive". Well, I still use the technologies I have studied 15Y ago.

[no-factor] salary .. has increased significantly (over 5Y) for the_SWE_jobs_I_focus_on. I'm hearing USD 200k without bonus for many of my peers on WallSt.
