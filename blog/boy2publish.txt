--new: CSY's BostonU kid
jolt: 
Shanyou's son had academic talents in high school but refused to study. He "only" managed to earn a half-scholarship to study comp science in Boston University.
Shanyou felt "what a waste -- he could get into ivy league". 
I'm feeling the same about my son. As I criticize CSY for his parenting attitude/perception, I have to admit that I am in the same trap -- 五十步笑百步.

This is one of the elements of reality I have to accept.

--new: am still fixated on benchmarks
fuxi jolt: why i say his math is weaker than his Eng, Sci etc?
Because his percentile in this class, but ...
.. but his low score is often due to attention to details
.. but wordy problems are hard for everyone
.. but his "higher" classmates might be using rote techniques, with poor clarity of thinking

Because I'm comparing his clarity of thinking to ME in wordy problems vs science etc !
.. but i should mostly compare him to his contemporary

--new jolt: I would speak uplifting langauge if he is weak
If my kid is genuinly weak in wordy problems, and lacks self-confidence, I would create uplifting words to build up his confidence.

Right now, Am doing the opposite -- He is improving but am using harsh words to cut him in half. I do it due to his attitude/motivation. 

Sherleen, grandpa and wife (over many months) all pointed out that my words (I would add "perception") on dabao's math standard are too negative. I am at my worst when talking about pattern recognition in wordy problems. Grandma sometimes echos my negativity. I use these words well before I lose my cool.

Perhaps grandma's attitude/perception is not a role model, but a negative example of anger management.

However, It is unfair to put 100% of the blame on grandma. I'm (at least 90%) responsible for my own action.

Grandpa issued the gravest warning -- my words would decimate dabao's self-esteem, confidence.

Sherleen said "uplifting" after she noticed dabao's lack of self-esteem. Now I think that for some individuals, affirmative words are a key language of love. I should read the book (online) to understand this one languge of love.

--new: don't-care: inefficient study->no time to play
dabao is not bothered with the fact that he has close to no time for play because he spends all his time on homework and tuition
I feel he has little desire to get more free time. 

i feel the pain of heavy homework+tuition is not an unberable pain to him.

I feel he doesn't really know what he wants to do with his spare time or how to convert spare time to enjoyment, so he doesn't bother to create spare time.

Playtime is frequently ineffective as a motivator to him. An aimless boy?

--new jolt: my huge t-spend with boy in q3sg was not so stupid.
It was an experiment comparable to my msfm, my c++, my c#, my overseas investment...

Experiment are risky in terms of disappointments. 

His renzi was (is) strategic to me. I took a calculated risk. 
In hind sight, I had no better use of my spare time. I couldn't save my spare time in a freezer for later use.

Without these experiments, could we discover .

-- new: Jack Zhang on parenting
高压 discipline ..

Observe what the kid wants and fulfill his needs.

keep the communication open as they go through adolescence. 

Accept some variations in individual personalities.

Curiosity is a good thing in a kid.

..JackZ on my family migration
U.S. migration might be more risky for your kids then for you

Make sure you still have enough time for your kids when you are working here. Short commute (like 95G) would be huge.

Parent's time is a key factor in Raymond's success story.

JackZ: If you feel your son is likely to become a manager type, then perhaps the wordy problem skills (abstract logical skills) are not really relevant in the long run. Self-confidence is arguably more important.

Both Jack and grandpa foresee that my derogatory remarks could easily damage boy's confidence.  I use such harsh words to get his attention, but apparently the net effect is counterproductive. Jack suggested -- paste reminder on your computer, in your cockpit, on the mirror ... to remind yourself.

Given the lack of interest in wordy problems, U.S. culture would probably emphasize encouragement not forced practice.
