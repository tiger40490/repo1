--new: comparing math standard SG^US^CN
jolt: his math skills overall, if benchmarked in U.S., might be an A-.

His wordy problem performance might be B+.

His SG classmates' math standard, if benchmarked in China, might be a B, because I know from experience that China's math standard is higher.

China students would look down on these SG counterparts because "their tough problems are so easy for us. They are just hopeless."

--new : SG wordy problem has a negative effect 
jolt:
the wordy problems in Singapore math classes have a negative effect, if not an overall negative aspect in the Singapore education system.
It has a negative effect on my wife and me.
If we are in the U.S. the math training may be too simple but no such unnecessary anxiety.
I try to be rational about these wordy problems but I find myself trapped. 

Since c++US days, I have told myself to avoid this part of the exam. 

--new: Good questions@math coaching sessions
jolt: 
Q: in my recent wordy problem face time, is boy making an effort 
I would say yes.

Q: Is he learning a reusable method?
Am 51% confident

Q: Is he paying attention?
Am 60% confident

--new: math: fun learning sites
sugg: to boy, MRT is a big fancy maze, maps are toys, ikea is a big toy.
Therefore, many math problems can be delivered via online play-learn, but I would need to find those websites.

Khan academy? 

ROTI? May not be effective.

--new: train kids2b self-dependent
I have heard the conventional and expert advice for years -- make school-age children self-dependent.
Now I think it may fail miserably for a few percent of the kids. My son could be one of them. 

I (grandpa too) feel he is many years younger than other 11-year olds, in terms of academic motivation and self-discipline. Such motivation requires a form of long-term vision. Some young kids lack any long-term vision. They can't see beyond the next week.

Therefore, grandpa now advocates
* use outside tuitions
* parents to baby-sit him for his studies

The P6 increased workload demands significant effort ,,, usually from the pupil, but in this case, from parents (and tutor) since dabao can't find the /energy/ from within.

--new: don't-care: inefficiency->no-time2play
dabao is not bothered with the fact that he has close to no time for play because he spends all his time on homework and tuition
I feel he has little desire to get more free time. 

i feel the pain of heavy homework+tuition is not an unberable pain to him.

I feel he doesn't really know what he wants to do with his spare time or how to convert spare time to enjoyment, so he doesn't bother to create spare time.

Playtime is frequently ineffective as a motivator to him. An aimless boy?

-- new: Jack Zhang on parenting
高压 discipline ..

Observe what the kid wants and fulfill his needs.

keep the communication open as they go through adolescence. 

Accept some variations in individual personalities.

Curiosity is a good thing in a kid.

..JackZ on my family migration
U.S. migration might be more risky for your kids then for you

Make sure you still have enough time for your kids when you are working here. Short commute (like 95G) would be huge.

Parent's time is a key factor in Raymond's success story.

JackZ: If you feel your son is likely to become a manager type, then perhaps the wordy problem skills (abstract logical skills) are not really relevant in the long run. Self-confidence is arguably more important.

Both Jack and grandpa foresee that my derogatory remarks could easily damage boy's confidence.  I use such harsh words to get his attention, but apparently the net effect is counterproductive. Jack suggested -- paste reminder on your computer, in your cockpit, on the mirror ... to remind yourself.

Given the lack of interest in wordy problems, U.S. culture would probably emphasize encouragement not forced practice.
