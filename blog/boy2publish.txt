--new: CSY's BostonU kid
jolt: 
Shanyou's son had academic talents in high school but refused to study. He "only" managed to earn a half-scholarship to study comp science in Boston University.
Shanyou felt "what a waste -- he could get into ivy league". 
I'm feeling the same about my son. As I criticize CSY for his parenting attitude/perception, I have to admit that I am in the same trap -- 五十步笑百步.

This is one of the elements of reality I have to accept.

--e-games: not all equal
Not all games are created equal, equally addictive, ,,
Boy won't prefer a parent who is ignorant of the different games.

I told grandpa that he has a bias against Hongkongers. I too have a bias against e-games.

--new: wordy problems: as academic as 作文
In terms of practical value
2-star: if he doesn't like Chinese compo and puts in no effort, I am not so worried.
3-star: But wordy problems are somewhat impractical, kinda contrived. Why do I worry so much?
4-star: If he doesn't like arithmetics and puts in no effort, I worry about his foundation skills.

However, I feel the biggest limitation is immaturity -- no inner drive to overcome the basic laziness that's inherent in every person.

jolt: I realized long ago that the Chinese composition requirement is unrealistic for many kids. 
Too much pressure. 

Now I feel the math wordy problems are highly contrived. Equation is the right method but not taught. Fuck the system!

Similarly, the science marking system (keyword-based) is contrived and stupid.

The SG quantity of practice is possibly too much at high school level, even for a China high school student in 1991.
Will the U.S. quantity be more effective more appropriate for my son?

Over 2 years, I gradually realized that my Singapore classmates mostly showed speed but shallow understanding in math and physics. 

I feel IF my son shows enough understanding, but insufficient speed, I should avoid applying the SG exam standard.

If in another country the quantity/speed is 50% lower, he may be doing just fine. Perhaps at P3 he was at that position.
So is he too slow at arithmetics? My assessment is, tragically, influenced by the SG exam system.
I want to say fuck the SG exam system. Fuck the contrived wordy problems.
If I spend some time analyzing quantity/speed (Not complexity) in U.S. P5 math exams (common standard?), I will get some idea what's "normal" in another system.

Now I may need the inner strength to withstand the pressure from the SG school system. The streaming, the "caste", the PSLE 3-digit scores,

fuxi: jolt: not 90% of the Chinese parents tell me to be strict
I feel perhaps 40-60% of the Chinese parents practice that.

(I feel for their kids Strict probably works better than in my case.)

--new: LorongChuan swim trips: t-overspent
jolt
t-spend with boy's swim (esp. the Lor Chuan trips) was over-spent, but how about my other lasers like
QQ
MSFM
personal investment
camp-out

Are they more strategic? I doubt it

--new jolt: my huge t-spend with boy in q3sg was not so stupid.
It was an experiment comparable to my msfm, my c++, my c#, my overseas investment...

Experiment are risky in terms of disappointments. 

His renzi was (is) strategic to me. I took a calculated risk. 
In hind sight, I had no better use of my spare time. I couldn't save my spare time in a freezer for later use.

Without these experiments, could we discover .

-- new: Jack Zhang on parenting
高压 discipline ..

Observe what the kid wants and fulfill his needs.

keep the communication open as they go through adolescence. 

Accept some variations in individual personalities.

Curiosity is a good thing in a kid.

..JackZ on my family migration
U.S. migration might be more risky for your kids then for you

Make sure you still have enough time for your kids when you are working here.

Parent's time is a key factor in Raymond's success story.

JackZ: If you feel your son is likely to become a manager type, then perhaps the wordy problem skills (abstract logical skills) are not really relevant in the long run. Self-confidence is arguably more important.

Both Jack and grandpa foresee that my derogatory remarks could easily damage boy's confidence.  I use such harsh words to get his attention, but apparently the net effect is counterproductive. Jack suggested -- paste reminder on your computer, in your cockpit, on the mirror ... to remind yourself.

Given the lack of interest in wordy problems, U.S. culture would probably emphasize encouragement not forced practice.
