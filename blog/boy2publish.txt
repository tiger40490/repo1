--new: wordy problems: what help needed
I feel what he needs is not academic help, but a ton of encouragement and some control 温和的坚持. Consider my yoga experience.

I advocated for a long time to stop tuitions, but now I feel we could pay a tutor and I can (avoid) take time off from work.

My dismal ROTI is a real pain and negative feedback.

--%%renzi regime ^ Raymond's approach on math
infinite patience infinite time.  Accept low commitment accept short attention span accept give-up attitude (Mrs Goh's observation).

I think Sakamoto teacher is similar.

See my blogpost on renzi. In hindsight, I feel the hours (actually months) spent on his renzi was too high.

If you plant a cucumber and it doesn't grow well, would you blame the cucumber? No but you need to assess the time you put in.

--new: [19]wanted2reduce boy's math practice
jolt
I decided in NY to come home and reduce boy's math workload -- saturation, eroding confidence/interest..

The "perseverance" slogan is directly against my plan.

The real obstacle is not brain power, but will power, or (intrisic or extrinsic) motivation.

--new: Good questions@math coaching sessions
jolt: 
Q: in my recent wordy problem face time, is boy making an effort 
I would say yes.

Q: Is he learning a reusable method?
Am 51% confident

Q: Is he paying attention?
Am 60% confident

--new: math: fun learning sites
sugg: to boy, MRT is a big fancy maze, maps are toys, ikea is a big toy.
Therefore, many math problems can be delivered via online play-learn, but I would need to find those websites.

Khan academy? 

ROTI? May not be effective.

--new: train kids2b self-dependent@@
I have heard the conventional and expert advice for years -- make school-age children self-dependent.
Now I think it may fail miserably for a few percent of the kids. My son could be one of them. 

I (grandpa too) feel he is many years younger than other 11-year olds, in terms of academic motivation and self-discipline. Such motivation requires a form of long-term vision. Some young kids lack any long-term vision. They can't see beyond the next week.

Therefore, grandpa now advocates
* use outside tuitions
* parents to baby-sit him for his studies

The P6 increased workload demands significant effort ,,, usually from the pupil, but in this case, from parents (and tutor) since dabao can't find the /energy/ from within.

--new: don't-care: inefficiency->no-time2play
dabao is not bothered with the fact that he has close to no time for play because he spends all his time on homework and tuition
I feel he has little desire to get more free time. 

i feel the pain of heavy homework+tuition is not an unberable pain to him.

I feel he doesn't really know what he wants to do with his spare time or how to convert spare time to enjoyment, so he doesn't bother to create spare time.

Playtime is frequently ineffective as a motivator to him. An aimless boy?

--new: self-restraint in Chinese/Buddhist parenting
Western culture emphasizes hard driving, achievement, so I think some motivated or high-achievers have limited self-restraint

gaming is the prime example.

I should talk to more people with a gaming hobby, or smoking hobby, ... Rahul is one
These individuals could be very motivated, hard-working, high-flying

I think grandpa is a huge influence on me, but perhaps there are some more successful individuals in his circle with some of those habits.

--new: bell-curve benchmark: i can't influence fellow students
jolt

I feel I need to focus more on motivation than benchmark. The fixation on academic ranking is frustrating because it’s always relative to fellow students. I have zero control over the performance of fellow students.

Each kid has a different needs. My son may need more time to wind down before he starts his homework.

--new: ##good parents: wife+me
* both kids are healthy
* screen time is limited
* boy takes care of meimei
* they are reasonably good on academics, beyond benchmark grades

-- new: Jack Zhang on parenting
高压 discipline ..

Observe what the kid wants and fulfill his needs.

keep the communication open as they go through adolescence. 

Accept some variations in individual personalities.

Curiosity is a good thing in a kid.

..JackZ on my family migration
U.S. migration might be more risky for your kids then for you

Make sure you still have enough time for your kids when you are working here. Short commute (like 95G) would be huge.

Parent's time is a key factor in Raymond's success story.

JackZ: If you feel your son is likely to become a manager type, then perhaps the wordy problem skills (abstract logical skills) are not really relevant in the long run. Self-confidence is arguably more important.

Both Jack and grandpa foresee that my derogatory remarks could easily damage boy's confidence.  I use such harsh words to get his attention, but apparently the net effect is counterproductive. Jack suggested -- paste reminder on your computer, in your cockpit, on the mirror ... to remind yourself.

Given the lack of interest in wordy problems, U.S. culture would probably emphasize encouragement not forced practice.

--new: happy mediocre child
I need to keep this image of my son. It is a good, practical goal.

I can see that if academic pressure were lower, and his relative academic weakness were not so visible, then everyone would be happier.

Over the long horizon, I told myself to accept a happy mediocre child. This prospect feels like a personal weakness in FOLB 
* Chinese compo weakness in lower middle school
* limited leadership capacity

Over the short term, I need to accept a below-average level of confidence, drive, self-control, goal/desire...Grandpa calls it immaturity.
