I decided in NY to come home and reduce boy's math workload -- saturation, eroding confidence/interest..
The "perseverance" slogan is directly against it.

My first hand experience shows that he has forgotten many recent problems he solved.  We don't need more problems; we need re-practice.

--jolt: when i feel boy will fail his exams, I need to remember tutor's words -- he is much better than many slow, rebellious kids, so he will pass for sure, despite his weaknesses in arithmetic, apply-his-mind, carelessness etc

I criticized Shanyou for his "shame" about his son, but what about my feeling of inferiority about my son's math benchmark performance?

--jolt:
Without the bmark crisis, 
I wouldn't see his arithmetic weakness due to years of neglect
I wouldn't say he is so lazy. Perhaps he is more motivated than many kids of another country.
I wouldn't see his poor clarity of thinking and pattern recognition
I wouldn't feel so negative about his tech career

--jolt: I realized long ago that the Chinese composition requirement is unrealistic for many kids. 
Too much pressure. 

Now I feel the math word problems are highly contrived. Equation is the right method but not taught. Fuck the system!

The SG quantity of practice is possibly too much at high school level, even for a China high school student in 1991.
Will the U.S. quantity be more effective more appropriate for my son?

Over 2 years, I realized that my Singapore classmates mostly showed speed but shallow understanding in math and physics. 

I feel IF my son shows enough understanding, but insufficient speed, I should avoid applying the SG exam standard.

If in another country the quantity/speed is 50% lower, he may be doing just fine. Perhaps at P3 he was at that position.
So is he too slow at arithmetics? My assessment is, tragically, influenced by the SG exam system.
I want to say fuck the SG exam system. Fuck the contrived word problems.
If I spend some time analyzing quantity/speed (Not complexity) in U.S. P5 math exams (common standard?), I will get some idea what's "normal" in another system.

Now I may need the inner strength to withstand the pressure from the SG school system. The streaming, the "caste", the PSLE 3-digit scores, 

--new jolt: he has strengths that can compensate for his limited absorbency for abstract...
* geometry
* science
* English reading as a pleasure ... so precious

--new jolt: absorbency and effort
my criticism on boy is mostly about effort and absorbency. 
but my own absorbency is also limited. So is my wife's absorbency. 五十步笑百步。 I'm unable to do x leetcode problems a week!

I think I know the consequences better than he does.
I guess he lacks self-discipline, seriously lacking

I think my son is making serious effort. His math talent and absorbency (abilities) is limited. If that's the case we have no reason to blame him. We should accept him as he is.

Is Absorbency part of effort or abilities? Now I don't know. In my case, it's abilities. In my son, i tend to see it as effort... double standard!

--new (jolt): crucial to compare his science to his math.
his science is not "P2 level" as his math is.

I'm lacking the tech knowledge to judge his scientific learning.

--jolt: double-standard
if he doesn't like Chinese compo and puts in no effort, I am not so worried.

If he doesn't like math and puts in no effort, I worried about his foundation skills!
