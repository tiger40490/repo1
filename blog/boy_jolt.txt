--Shanyou's son had academic talents in high school but refused to study. He "only" managed to earn a half-scholarship to study comp science in Boston University.
Shanyou felt "what a waste -- he could get into ivy league". 
I'm feeling the same about my son

This is one of the elements of reality I have to accept.

--I commit two common mistakes re boy's study:
my reward/discipline should not be based on peer comparison
should not be based on effort either. Hiring mgr often tells inteviewee "if you can finish your work well you can come late and leave eary". 

--boy has a point: if i don't come home during lunch break, and spends my time in some forgettable way, i won't feel so disappointed.

The fact that boy is not so competitive at A/B/C/D should not be used as a whip to beat myself up for my decisions to spend time coaching him.

Somehow am not celebrating every small improvement in boy. 

need to make him see that dad's bar is not too high.

--e-game
Not all games are created equal, equally addictive, ,,
Boy won't prefer a parent who is ignorant of the different games.

--q: does he ever find the "checklist" useful against careless mistakes?
If not, he won't use it in exam.

Before his next math sheet, ask him "What common mistakes do you tend to make?" Ask him to write it on a sticker. Then after he finishes the sheet, ask him to check each question.

The process of conceiving the checklist and using it is conscious and active learning.

--new: renzi coaching effort: review
With renzi, for 2 years I had a steady and clear focus (not fixated on benchmark). Clearly better than other parents. 

Still, one crucial missing link -- xxxq. He didn't want to apply his mind.

Now in 2019, my son's renzi is much better than I feared. (By the way, he is also stronger than half of his classmates, but not my focus.) 
Yet, using result to judge my effort can be very unfair and discouraging. 
Result implies measurement against some yardstick, and it implies some expectation.
Perhaps my effort was good and helpful, but due to lack of xxxq, his progress was slower than expected.

别人的孩子轻轻松松考到 250 分， 我家孩子怎么也到不了 200 分。。。

(peer comparison!)

全国统一考试 造成这种严重误区。 在美国很多家长 （我猜测非亚裔） 坚决反对全州范围统一考试。 美国各小学各中学每年自主出题。 有的很难有的不太难，两校学生没法分数不可比。 对大器晚成的学生更人道,更仁慈, 更耐心。

--jolt:
t-spend with boy's swim (esp. the Lor Chuan trips) was over-spent, but how about the then other lasers like
QQ
MSFM
licai
camp-out

Are they more strategic? I doubt it
--jolt
Why is XR (or anyone in his shoes) so fixated on the expert diagnosis? Subconsciously we take it as a court judgement.

In reality, a grade-A academic child can become mediocre in college or professionally, while a grade-D child can turn out rather decent.

--jolt: my huge t-spend with boy in q3sg was not so stupid.
was an experiment comparable to my msfm, my c++, my c#, my overseas investment...

Experiment are risky in terms of disappointments. 

His renzi was (is) strategic to me. I took a calculated risk. 
In hind sight, I had no better use of my spare time. I couldn't save my spare time in a freezer for later use.

Without these experiments, could we discover .

--new blogpost: jolt: the time spent blogging about boy is
therapeutic.

Also, the time spent preparing his math worksheet is therapeutic.

I'm good at these even though these take up huge amount of energy and precious quiet time.
Luckily I don't feel worn out by these efforts.

I feel at my age, parenting IS a main job, comparable to my day job. 
Actually, Career progression is NOT my main responsibility at this stage of my life.

--new blogpost: jolt: my care-less attitude and t-spend on meimei is possibly good, according to grandpa.

--jolt:
when you feel you are angry with boy about his attitude and effort, cool down for a few seconds and ask yourself "Be honest, are you zen about the peer comparison rat race?"

Grandpa is more zen.

--new blogpost: jolt: for many of my peers, their parents set high bars and don't praise them.

For my son, i need to set my bar very low and praise him for every small improvement.

--new blogpost: jolt: not 90% of the Chinese parents tell me to be strict

I feel perhaps 40-60% of the Chinese parents practice that. 
(I feel for their kids Strict probably works better than in my case.)

--new blogpost: jolt: every time I say something negative about my son, I should precede and follow it with something positive. 

Not easy

--jolt: what if I'm still in NY?

Q: Is it a crisis in terms of his math, diet, ..? 

Q: Am I coaching him to become much better? 
A: I think I have some influence but not dramatic. Without me he would still grow as a normal kid

--new blogpost: jolt:
the word problems in Singapore math classes have a negative effect, if not an overall negative aspect in the Singapore education system.
It has a negative effect on my wife and me.
If we are in the U.S. the math training may be too simple but no such unnecessary anxiety.
I try to be rational about these word problems but I find myself trapped. 

Since c++US days, I have told myself to avoid this part of the exam. 


--jolt
As a student, I found certain subjects completely boring and useless -- politics, Chinese, biology

Most of my classmates felt the same about history, 

So we were not motivated to memorize or practice.

--jolt: apparently, only one student in his class is comfortable with the word problems.

Sounds like everyone else is afraid and anxious about word problems.

This says a lot about the quality and effectiveness of this education

--jolt
I decided in NY to come home and reduce boy's math workload -- saturation, eroding confidence/interest..
The "perseverance" slogan is directly against my plan.

My first-hand experience shows that he has forgotten many recent problems he solved.  We don't need more problems; we need re-practice.

--jolt: I realized long ago that the Chinese composition requirement is unrealistic for many kids. 
Too much pressure. 

Now I feel the math word problems are highly contrived. Equation is the right method but not taught. Fuck the system!

The SG quantity of practice is possibly too much at high school level, even for a China high school student in 1991.
Will the U.S. quantity be more effective more appropriate for my son?

Over 2 years, I realized that my Singapore classmates mostly showed speed but shallow understanding in math and physics. 

I feel IF my son shows enough understanding, but insufficient speed, I should avoid applying the SG exam standard.

If in another country the quantity/speed is 50% lower, he may be doing just fine. Perhaps at P3 he was at that position.
So is he too slow at arithmetics? My assessment is, tragically, influenced by the SG exam system.
I want to say fuck the SG exam system. Fuck the contrived word problems.
If I spend some time analyzing quantity/speed (Not complexity) in U.S. P5 math exams (common standard?), I will get some idea what's "normal" in another system.

Now I may need the inner strength to withstand the pressure from the SG school system. The streaming, the "caste", the PSLE 3-digit scores, 

--jolt: when i feel boy will fail his exams, I need to remember tutor's words -- he is much better than many slow, rebellious kids, so he will pass for sure, despite his weaknesses in arithmetic, apply-his-mind, carelessness etc.

I think many Singapore students are very very weak in basic math skills.

I criticized Shanyou for his "shame" about his son, but what about my feeling of inferiority about my son's math benchmark performance?

--jolt:
Without the bmark crisis, 
I wouldn't see his arithmetic weakness created by years of neglect
I wouldn't say he is so lazy. Perhaps he is more motivated than many kids of another country.
I wouldn't see his poor clarity of thinking and pattern recognition
I wouldn't feel so negative about his tech career

--new jolt: absorbency and effort
my criticism on boy is mostly about effort and absorbency. 
but my own absorbency is also limited. So is my wife's absorbency. 五十步笑百步。 I'm unable to do x leetcode problems a week!

I think I know the consequences better than he does.
I guess he lacks self-discipline, seriously lacking

I think my son is making serious effort. His math talent and absorbency (abilities) is limited. If that's the case we have no reason to blame him. We should accept him as he is.

Is Absorbency part of effort or abilities? Now I don't know. In my case, it's abilities. In my son, i tend to see it as effort... double standard!


--the media suggests that many parents (mostly mothers) of pre-teens spend half their weekends taking kids to places hoping to expose them to in-situ learning. 

In q3SG phase, I was silly enough to follow these suggestions. I forgot I'm a different parent with my own priorities and limitations. One of the key differences -- 
My spare time is so precious to me. Many of These parents have lots of spare time that they spend on e-entertainments (gaming, internet surfing, online chatting) dining out, socializing. I'm completely different. 

The t-cost of weekend TO me is 5 times higher than the cost TO them. 

Another key difference -- their effort possibly paid off more than in my son.

我的同学有好几个拒绝学英语， 更多的同学讨厌政治，或历史， 或语文。 这些同学后来成绩也没有那么糟糕。 都及格了。 

这几科大都是中学科目。 12 岁以上。

得过且过，尽量少吃苦，这种学习态度，挺常见的。

也听说有的孩子拒绝完成作业。 

--new (jolt): crucial to compare his science to his math.
his science is not "P2 level" as his math is.

--jolt: double-standard
In terms of practical value

2-star: if he doesn't like Chinese compo and puts in no effort, I am not so worried.

3-star: But word problems are somewhat impractical, kinda contrived. Why do I worry so much?

4-star: If he doesn't like arithmetics and puts in no effort, I worry about his foundation skills.
