--jolt: not 90% of the Chinese parents tell me to be strict

I feel perhaps 40-60% of the Chinese parents practice that. 
(I feel for their kids Strict probably works better than in my case.)

--every time I say something negative about my son, I should precede and follow it with something positive. 

Not easy

--what if I'm still in NY?

Q: Is it a crisis in terms of his math, diet, ..? 

Q: Am I coaching him to become much better? 
A: I think I have some influence but not dramatic. Without me he would still grow as a normal kid

--jolt:
the word problems in Singapore math classes have a negative effect, if not an overall negative aspect in the Singapore education system.
It has a negative effect on my wife and me.
If we are in the U.S. the math training may be too simple but no such unnecessary anxiety.
I try to be rational about these word problems but I find myself trapped. 

Since c++US days, I have told myself to avoid this part of the exam. 

--jolt
As a student, I found certain subjects completely boring and useless -- politics, Chinese, biology

Most of my classmates felt the same about history, 

So we were not motivated to memorize or practice.

--jolt: apparently, only one student in his class is comfortable with the word problems.

Sounds like everyone else is afraid and anxious about word problems.

This says a lot about the quality and effectiveness of this education

I decided in NY to come home and reduce boy's math workload -- saturation, eroding confidence/interest..
The "perseverance" slogan is directly against it.

My first hand experience shows that he has forgotten many recent problems he solved.  We don't need more problems; we need re-practice.

--jolt: when i feel boy will fail his exams, I need to remember tutor's words -- he is much better than many slow, rebellious kids, so he will pass for sure, despite his weaknesses in arithmetic, apply-his-mind, carelessness etc

I criticized Shanyou for his "shame" about his son, but what about my feeling of inferiority about my son's math benchmark performance?

--jolt:
Without the bmark crisis, 
I wouldn't see his arithmetic weakness due to years of neglect
I wouldn't say he is so lazy. Perhaps he is more motivated than many kids of another country.
I wouldn't see his poor clarity of thinking and pattern recognition
I wouldn't feel so negative about his tech career

--jolt: I realized long ago that the Chinese composition requirement is unrealistic for many kids. 
Too much pressure. 

Now I feel the math word problems are highly contrived. Equation is the right method but not taught. Fuck the system!

The SG quantity of practice is possibly too much at high school level, even for a China high school student in 1991.
Will the U.S. quantity be more effective more appropriate for my son?

Over 2 years, I realized that my Singapore classmates mostly showed speed but shallow understanding in math and physics. 

I feel IF my son shows enough understanding, but insufficient speed, I should avoid applying the SG exam standard.

If in another country the quantity/speed is 50% lower, he may be doing just fine. Perhaps at P3 he was at that position.
So is he too slow at arithmetics? My assessment is, tragically, influenced by the SG exam system.
I want to say fuck the SG exam system. Fuck the contrived word problems.
If I spend some time analyzing quantity/speed (Not complexity) in U.S. P5 math exams (common standard?), I will get some idea what's "normal" in another system.

Now I may need the inner strength to withstand the pressure from the SG school system. The streaming, the "caste", the PSLE 3-digit scores, 

--new jolt: he has strengths that can compensate for his limited absorbency for abstract...
* geometry
* chart reading
* science
* English reading as a pleasure ... so precious

--new jolt: absorbency and effort
my criticism on boy is mostly about effort and absorbency. 
but my own absorbency is also limited. So is my wife's absorbency. 五十步笑百步。 I'm unable to do x leetcode problems a week!

I think I know the consequences better than he does.
I guess he lacks self-discipline, seriously lacking

I think my son is making serious effort. His math talent and absorbency (abilities) is limited. If that's the case we have no reason to blame him. We should accept him as he is.

Is Absorbency part of effort or abilities? Now I don't know. In my case, it's abilities. In my son, i tend to see it as effort... double standard!

--new: word problems are not that "important"
I think his math thinking is not bad, as shown in geometry.

there are many skills of practical value.

I think my son may show more interest in the less abstract subjects like science, or coding.

我的同学有好几个拒绝学英语， 更多的同学讨厌政治，或历史， 或语文。 这些同学后来成绩也没有那么糟糕。 都及格了。 

这几科大都是中学科目。 12 岁以上。

得过且过，尽量少吃苦，这种学习态度，挺常见的。

也听说有的孩子拒绝完成作业。 

--new (jolt): crucial to compare his science to his math.
his science is not "P2 level" as his math is.

I'm lacking the tech knowledge to judge his scientific learning.

--jolt: double-standard
In terms of practical value

2-star: if he doesn't like Chinese compo and puts in no effort, I am not so worried.

3-star: But word problems are somewhat impractical, kinda contrived. Why do I worry so much?

4-star: If he doesn't like arithmetics and puts in no effort, I worry about his foundation skills.
