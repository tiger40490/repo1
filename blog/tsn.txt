[tags t_othRisk, t_framework]
when I tsn, i aim at multiple target 'gains' as in a pyramid
strategic value is the most elusive, comparable to HuKun taking his brother as role model. More strategic is my rental property investment
salary hike is one of the least likely [CVA]
i hope to open up new job markets at similar pay. I enjoy wider range of oppo and being in-demand
but the new market is unsuitable, ..
i hope to broaden my capability base incl dnlg. 
I don't want all my eggs in one basket... hedging
but the broad base may not be so relevant,..
i hope to build my self-confidence about learning
but sometimes not much self-confidence boost,.. 
i hope to keep my mind active and engaged, rather than doing the same boring job over 5Y

(Not really about tsn) i also want to strengthen my position, extend my lead on the body-building race. This effort takes huge amount of energy

if all else fail, i hope to avoid waste my precious spare time - burn/rot

My thick->thin insight into c#, SQL, swing, quant ... are not needed at present. Future? How about my current heavy t-investment in socket, TMP, c++11...?

Focus today is ROTI, NOT about churn. Socket, SQL, core c++ are actually the best-performing tech bets in terms of robust demand and shelf-life. 

If you stay within core java (like XR and many friends), then you don't need to learn these other skills, but are they better off now? Diminishing return in ROTI?

I think it's impossibly hard to keep keep up ROTI. I can aim for accu, thick->thin, cross-pollination, churn resistance, sustained focus, traction, engaging, ... but ROTI is still underwhelming.

ROTI is a huge "deflator" of my enthusiasm, motivation, absorbency.. I think I need rational expectations.

Among the biggest 10 branching out (tsn) from java/SQL/perl , I still favor c++/socket/py/mktData.

--no blogpost: long-term orgro=elusive
long-term orgro is elusive. Biggest success I can think of is c++ (thanks to lots of IV) but in terms of salary increasae, I can't think of any... perhaps quant dev

swing -- rare engagement + orgro, thick->thin but abandoned !

c# -- i made sacrifices for deep-dive, and in return experienced rare engagement + orgro + thick->thin. I have since given up the direction, as c# is not so relevant to my current direction.

--new blog: spare time: what can peers do@@
strategic orgro, ROTI .. is holy grail -- elusive
investment (HuKun, XR)? I doubt any of them has any roti

deepen in java? for promotion or higher pay? Higher pay is basically hopeless since we are already at the higher end. Promotion has no correlation with deeper java nlg

tsn? 

My c++/c#/quant/swing attempts now look commendable. 

--no blogpost: delights: engaged,leverage,strategic.. 
[tags t_othRisk]
I feel my expectation was invariably too high in terms of strategic value, leverage and ROTI, therefore underwhelming. 
(engagement ... expectation was moderately too high) 
Against this backdrop, there are little delights, but stigma/respect (not salary!) was too huge as a factor and overshadowed those little delights. For a perspective, please look at the spreadsheet "predict next 3-5Y job satisfaction"

I chose a python job at Macq .. engaged for a few months, to my delight
I chose the c++ job at RTS .. engaged for 6 months, to my delight. 
* Reason: traction in interviews and also in GTD and zbs
* Reason: interviews
* Reason: socket QQ was in-demand
* Reason: QQ discussions with colleagues .. visible progress

Both job decisions produced good/superior leverage over 5Y.

I chose a c# job ... engaged for a year and then disengaged, shorter than expected. Leverage was good.

I chose a Quant dev job ... engaged for a year and never disengaged. Leverage was underwhelming.

I chose a c++ large scale eq OMS job ... engaged for a few months. Leverage is unknown

--no blogpost: c#^java/c++ journeys
[tags t_below7]
my c# xx journey was exciting for 6M before OC and in first year in OC. In contrast, my core-java/c++ (less for jxee) journeys have generated superior ROTI (elusive) because 
* the interview topics are stable 
* market waves steered me to stick to (not abandon) these career directions

leverage? c# is lower but not bad. See separate blogpost

For all languages, there is no hike, no strategic value so at that level all underwhelming
