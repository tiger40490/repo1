-- well done
after boy booked flight, I exploded then I calmed down with Genn's help
in hind sight, it was good that he tried to book a flight.

We persuaded grandma to let me control her ICBC account. We both recognized it as a big step forward, on a strategic learning project

the face scan challenge was .. strategically trivial as recognized, but emotionally draining (not only on grandma), and jeopardize our harmony. I was wise to offer grandma the reassurance "if too tired and need sleep, then postpone to May trip"

I did offer wife multiple destinations. I did my best to accompany them.
I got up early every day and spent many breakfast hours with grandma

-- thank God
All healthy
grandma is active, positive, engaged
nothing lost
good weather
