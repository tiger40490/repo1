--which of these two scenarios would a parent fear more:
* my kids go to a mediocre college, get a mediocre job, earning a below-median income -- https://tanbintpy.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=3590&action=edit
* 学坏 , renegade, deliquent ... get into trouble. Hopefully, low risk if both parents stay with the kids, but consider Aunt Genn. 

--I need to show him that I'm proud of him
* English better than most kids in China
* Chinese better than most kids in U.S.
* Science
* mult verse
* gadgets
* maps
* social skills
* kind to meimei
* piano
* bicycle
* height -- lucky my boy is not too skinny or short
* can swim

--fuxi: 5 lang of love for boy
physical gifts
quality time -- keeping company. He doesn't like to be left alone, except with a screen

Q: why does love matter in this academic benchmark race?
A: because support, family bonding ,,, outweights the crazy benchmark

--fuxi: I asked Raymond why Malay students seldom out-perform.
Raymond is confident that IQ is not one of the factors.

He said another factor is that Malay parents have too many kids and too little spare time outside work (often 1.5 to two jobs). Jack He also said affluent families often have full time mom taking care of kids.

Raymond pointed out the hours he spends with his boys.

--fuxi: I'm STILL trying to make dabao another tanbin
This tendency is very stubborn and subtle.

He has his own strengths, interests, hobbies, preferred way to solving problems and meeting challenges ....

I have my weaknesses, limitations, faults in my making. Over many years of "adjustment" I have come to terms with some of my limitations. Now I need to accept his limitations. 

Look at Genn. As a parent how would I accept her as she is, rather than a very poor copy of me?

--new: happy mediocre child
I need to keep a firm hold of this image of my son, as it is a good, practical goal

I can see that if academic pressure were lower, and his relative academic weakness were not so visible, then everyone would be happier.

Over the long horizon, I told myself to accept a happy mediocre child.
Over the short term, I need to accept a below-average level of confidence, drive, self-control, goal/desire...Grandpa calls it immaturity.

--fuxi: in recent years, most of the "successes" in my academic parenting required immediate reward in the form of fun activities.

It's harder to maintain the _unconditional_ love and endless patience for an older kid.

--fuxi: 温和的坚持 can help avoid creating in boy a seed of fear, hatred, self-hate 

--fuxi:   no subject
most of my huge effort to help boy was on the same area -- 上进， 不甘落后，克服困难，持之以恒重复练习， 不怕枯燥。

在这方面， 最有效的帮助是课外活动， 比如钢琴， 不必拿啥名次或证书， 就说他坚持到今天，没有终止，就是不可思议的进步，因为大宝的天性是非常的而不是一般的贪玩，

再比如游泳跑步，他都接受了。没有放弃。

这几项都是家长决定之后，提议坚持。 决定得对。 

除了这个方面， 我也曾帮大宝培养华文兴趣， 减肥， 没啥效果。
