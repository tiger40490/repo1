--fuxi: composing emails is slow-cooking. We need time. It's time well-spent.
At work or at home, we should NOT rush.

--fuxi: 
blog (and other) print-out helps concentration and breaks slippery slope 
* in office
* in open-house hours at home

-- i feel there's real conflict between my work honeymoon and parenting ..

There's a huge emotional involvement and I can lose my cool. Am not good at compartmentization

sacrificing work honeymoon ... for boy's math is questionable because
* Drive must come from within. Without it, we will be micro-managing, or driving with brake on
* risk of frustration ... missed punch
* risk of regret
* no proven method, so why keep investing precious resources into this unpromising, venture
* his job, not my job
* honeymoon is golden, precious, fleeting, 
* I decided long ago that I will only make time for him if he meets my conditions. Breaking my conditions is unwise and regretful. Tough!

Q (tough): boy is only asking me to help him do his homework not learning zbs. Is it good idea to sacrifice my work honeymoon?

now i can no longer afford to put 120% of my time into mlp (gtd, localSys...). 
* continue to strive towards early sleep, early rise
* continue to manage the call to grandparents
* work from home is ineffective, so if in the mood it is still a good idea to spend overtime in office
* perhaps reduce workout time


--Q: if I follow Raymond's model and spend a lot of time with boy, then where would that time come from?
reduce blogging?
reduce outing?

Q: which past job would let me spend more time with boy? for a few months, not for years
OC is best
RTS boss was pushy, heartless and not considerate

Again, I feel it depends on coworker benchmark, localSys i.e. your brainpower vs brainpower baked into localSys... and other factors I may be missing .

--working with boy on his problem sums is the least efficient item in my t-budget. 
A big red-flag item.
Need to control the tcost
I think a core issue is losing my cool

--missed punch is more tiring than landed punches. 
I need to spend more time in office and reduce the wasted time/energy on boy. 

For every 10 minutes of facetime, my tcost is about 10 times including the blogging tcost, so I need to reduce these "hidden tcosts"

spend more hours in office when in a normal mood 

No need to get him to practice 7 days a week ... unrealistic

focus on result -- his actual practice.

--seems very hard to "work" at home while managing boy's math drill. Problem is context switching tcost
Not ready to give up yet.

Need to find the "killer app" to make it work
How about workout as a burn?
How about english blogging?
How about FSM?
... somehow I tend to demonize all of the above !

Coding drill is not strategic either ! Workout is more strategic

I can record the time usage over a few evenings and ask "how could we improve? What's a better profile?"

--going home early
I used to feel the “warm feeling” about going home early … some math with boy, some shopping, a bit of exercise but the utilization rate was always very disappointing.

I tried locking myself up in a room. Still ineffective.
I tried connecting remotely. Still ineffective.
I feel sitting in MRT station or downstairs help to some extent, if I can do so for long enough.

--evening exercise at stadium can be 20-60 min ... very comfortable, but now my son needs me.

the physical and emotional benefits ... are insufficient. I need to commit more into localSys and my son's academics.

--fuxi: 5 Oct weekend in office
* no blogging except Eng vocab + a bit of nutrition
* sent out 2 x saved draft to Larry 
* created a new draft to Larry
* updated 2 drafts to Larry
* studied some fix tags related to my projects
* created a draft to Gary about diet
* some mini exercise
* spent time on normalization project

As soon as I start blogging, I should consider going home.

i tend to feel guilty about time usage [1] in office, but i feel worst at home.

[1] often up to 30% burn and up to 30% rot (like blogging, surfing, calling..)

--fuxi: should feel proud to fix the 0tiger40490 hotspot
but it's not worthwhile to speed up the lenovo$399 laptop. 

--new: create(valuable)quiet time
Even though my son needs me, I still have to prioritize this need among other things such as my quiet time and localSys
early morning at home + MRT? Best quiet time. See blogpost on early rise
early morning in office, before colleagues come in 10am? slippery slope
evening in office? I tend to have momentum on localSys xx
after 11pm? Ini reality I need 30-60 minutes to enter the zone.

Yoga (and stadium) should really push (pun intended) out to weekends

--new: Jolt: com`home early4family time
Coming home early for family time never worked for me. It probably works for many peers but not me. 
No reason to feel shame, pity, or inferiority.
The best I could do in the evening open-house is ... see the open-house todo lists?

--diet + tcost @ 22 Sep weekend@Vivo
! very conscious decisions so no regrets.

yong-toufu was good -- fibrous + lean. After that I had some leftover foods of medium calorie density

i made best use of the segments of spare time. What's the effectiveness? The laptop + printout did help.

How about the positive impacts on kids and wife?

wife surely feels better about me taking time out with family

--weekend family outing
exercise is burn ... hard burn
math practice and my coding drill is burn
tech xx is also burn, but less tough.

--family outings - vivo, east-coast, 
watch out my personal tcost. I could allocate it to 
* mlp prj + related self-xx
* coding drill
* c++/java QQ

--nothing new. integrate with t_focus@GTD and the 'timeMgmt' category in open blog
Yoga eats into work and family time..requires a lot of time including commute, preparation, arriving in advance and trying to read/blog there, (or kicked out) 

my time at home is limited:
* household chores -- leave to maid if possible
* time for boy
* multiplication table with memmei
* non-tech blogging+emailing is a huge contender
* tech xx including QQ, zbs, coding ... i would probably give up.

My hours in office are scarce :
* tech xx including QQ -- need to cut further. Might be tough and need optimization
* GTD -- camp out if in the mood
* localSys explore -- for long term productivity etc
* frequent breaks
* phone call to BJ

--sugg: budget time-for-boy?
If nothing planned, then go to office and ... work not xx or blog

--Q: how do I get more quiet time while living with family?  Note I need more quiet time than other fathers. I "bleed" more from the family distractions. 

Sugg: On some days, sleep early and catch earlier trains so I can study on trains; 
Sugg: take half-day leaves to create half-day quiet periods at home. This feature isn't available to contractor
sugg: weekends hold the biggest hope. Go to office?

--fuxi: morning home hours (7 - 8.30) tend to be spent on 
food prep .. can try at night. Now I think the healthy food has an effect ..
talking to wife without distraction
