--new: the allure of late night quiet time #living with family 
See also the blogpost on early rise

I often feel extremely lucky to get a quiet time after kids go to bed. It felt precious.

This quiet time is often inferior to other quiet times

* early rise quiet time is free of kids distraction. I can also talk to wife if I choose to.
* morning commute offers quiet time if I get to use git blogging
* In office I get plenty of quiet time .. early morning, after work, and during lunch break

I feel it's much better to sleep early and get up early. For now we can ignore the health benefits and focus on quiet time.

Consider taking mild sleeping pills to help me regulate. Consult a doctor

--focus during office hours
reduce casual browsing ... online banking etc. snowball risk.
also warehouse the curiosity searching until some designated defocus time.
keep 646 549 3446 at DBS, FSM to reduce office hour distraction

--nothing new. integrate with t_focus@GTD and the 'timeMgmt' category in open blog
Yoga eats into work and family time..requires a lot of time including commute, preparation, arriving in advance and waste time there, (or kicked out) 

my time at home is limited:
* household chores -- leave to maid if possible
* time for family esp. boy
* multiplication table with memmei
* non-tech blogging+emailing is a huge contender
* tech xx including QQ, zbs, coding ... i would probably give up.

My hours in office are scarce :
* tech xx including QQ -- need to cut further. Might be tough and need optimization
* GTD -- camp out if in the mood
* localSys explore -- for long term productivity etc
* frequent breaks
* phone call to BJ

--Q: how do I get more quiet time while living with family?  Note I need more quiet time than other fathers. I suffer more from the family distractions. 

I need quiet time for thinking/blogging about
* investment
* wellness planning and management
* many many non-trivial decisions
* managing other stressful items

Depending on the specific task on my plate, I will find ... "alternatives" as quiet time is scarce compared to my NY days.

Sugg: On some days, sleep early and catch earlier trains so I can study on trains; On other days, stay up late for quiet hours at night
sugg: Friday evening is golden. Other parts of the weekend can also be valuable
Sugg: take half-day leaves to create half-day quiet periods at home. This feature isn't available to contractor
Sugg: yo-yo diet on tech xx -- when we get the quiet time (in the mood or not), learn as much as possible.
