--a month into my hibernation, my time (i.e. laser, O2) still feels so precious
priorities? 

new job -- localSys, respect, ...
help my son's math exams
blogging -- analysis and juggling, like OS scheduler, competing with the tasks being scheduled
LG-recreation: time with meimei
LG-recreation: per-investment
LG2: discussion with friends. Email is far more efficient
LG2: discussion with grandparents
LG2: coding drill, 
LG2: c++maintenance? Lucky I could rely on the critical mass
LG2: yoga + workout? mini-workout is extremely efficient
+ food preparation: maid is great time-saver
+ commute is a huge time-saver
+ git-blogging + smemo-blogging whenever and wherever I have the inspiration

--new: create(valuable)quiet time
Even though my son needs me, I still have to prioritize this need among other things such as my quiet time and localSys
early morning at home + MRT? Best quiet time. See blogpost on early rise
early morning in office, before colleagues come in 10am? slippery slope
evening in office? I tend to have momentum on localSys xx
after 11pm? Ini reality I need 30-60 minutes to enter the zone.

Yoga (and stadium) should really push :) out to weekends

--new: coming home early for family time  
Coming home early for family never worked for me. It worked for many colleagues but not me. No reason to feel shame.
The best I could do in the evening open-house is ...?

--why the repo1/blog folder has so many files outside .../misc/? Because with family, I have so many competing priorities:
invest
boy
open-house
t-budget
wellness

-- sometimes the review of weekend hour utilization is counter-productive. Everyone's weekend is mostly "rot" not burn, including my role models. In fact those who "achieve" more than 3 hours of burning each weekend are probably fictional characters or doing something bad to their body and mind.

Probably they are focusing on something not so strategic or high-leverage, by my standard.

Steven Keith .. I really don't know what he does. I'm working with a whole theory based on just one sentence of anecdotal account.

Grandpa .. is a 1000 times more real as a role model but his wekends are not all burning.

Anyway, a fixation on burn/rot, leverage etc is mostly counterproductive

--important but not urgent:
flexibility
coding drill
c++ critical mass

--why no CIV? +ve Feedback loop is now broken
Out-ranked by
* parenting including boy's math
* family time
* ramp up -- driven by respect, self-respect, honeymoon
* yoga

--I am so used to measuring roti in terms of career including tech xx and ..

As I age, it is fundamental to increase the weightage on wellness, parenting, taking care of grandparents, marriage ...

For wellness, the huge effort may not produce visible effect !

As to parenting efforts, again huge tcost but slow improvement

--diet + tcost @ 22 Sep weekend@Vivo
! very consciously decisions so no regrets.

yong-toufu was good -- fibrous + lean. After that I had some leftover foods of medium calorie density

i made best use of the segments of spare time. What's the effectiveness? The laptop + printout did help.

How about the positive impacts on kids and wife?

wife surely feels better about me taking time out with family

--no need to launch git-bash every time.
Learn to live with the risk of data loss

--focus during office hours
reduce casual browsing ... online banking etc. snowball risk.
also warehouse the curiosity searching until some designated defocus time.
keep 646 549 3446 at DBS, FSM to reduce office hour distraction

--nothing new. integrate with t_focus@GTD and the 'timeMgmt' category in open blog
Yoga eats into work and family time..requires a lot of time including commute, preparation, arriving in advance and trying to read/blog there, (or kicked out) 

my time at home is limited:
* household chores -- leave to maid if possible
* time for boy
* multiplication table with memmei
* non-tech blogging+emailing is a huge contender
* tech xx including QQ, zbs, coding ... i would probably give up.

My hours in office are scarce :
* tech xx including QQ -- need to cut further. Might be tough and need optimization
* GTD -- camp out if in the mood
* localSys explore -- for long term productivity etc
* frequent breaks
* phone call to BJ

--sugg: budget time-for-boy?
If nothing planned, then go to office and ... work not xx or blog

--very hard to "work" at home while managing boy's math drill. Problem is context switching tcost

--Q: how do I get more quiet time while living with family?  Note I need more quiet time than other fathers. I "bleed" more from the family distractions. 

Sugg: On some days, sleep early and catch earlier trains so I can study on trains; On other days, stay up late for quiet hours at night
Sugg: take half-day leaves to create half-day quiet periods at home. This feature isn't available to contractor

--new: the allure of late night quiet time #living with family

Q: what's the best use of early rise hours?
A: stay home (no distraction) .. can talk to wife. Avoid non-work activities in office

I often feel extremely lucky to get a quiet time after kids go to bed. It felt .. precious.

This quiet time is often inferior to other quiet times

* early rise quiet time is free of kids distraction. I can also talk to wife if I choose to.
* morning commute offers quiet time if I get to use git blogging
* In office I get plenty of quiet time .. early morning, after work, and during lunch break

I feel it's much better to sleep early and get up early. For now we can ignore the health benefits and focus on quiet time.

Consider taking mild sleeping pills to help me regulate. Consult a doctor
