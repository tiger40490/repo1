i feel there's real conflict between my work honeymoon, parenting, yoga, early sleep, ...

Jolt: when i find myself in the honeymoon, I'd sleep late, take taxi home .. because the localSys absorbency is so precious. If I wait till next morning, I could lose it.

There's a huge emotional involvement in the math sessions with dabao, and I can lose my cool. Am not good at compartmentization

sacrificing work honeymoon ... for boy's math is questionable because
* Drive must come from within. Without it, we will be micro-managing, or driving with brake on
* risk of frustration ... missed punch
* risk of regret
* no proven method, so why keep investing precious resources into this unpromising, venture
* his job, not my job
* honeymoon is golden, precious, fleeting, 
* I decided long ago that I will only make time for him if he meets my conditions. Breaking my conditions is unwise and regretful. Tough!

Q (tough): boy is only asking me to help him do his homework not learning zbs. Is it good idea to sacrifice my work honeymoon?

now i can no longer afford to put 120% of my time into mlp (gtd, localSys...). 
* continue to strive towards early sleep, early rise
* continue to manage the call to grandparents
* work from home is ineffective, so if in the mood it is still a good idea to spend overtime in office
* perhaps reduce workout time

--fuxi: Q: if I follow Raymond's model and spend a lot of time with boy, then where would that time come from?
reduce blogging?
reduce outing?

Q: which past job would let me spend more time with boy? for a few months, not for years
OC is best
RTS boss was pushy, heartless and not considerate

Again, I feel it depends on coworker benchmark, localSys i.e. your brainpower vs brainpower baked into localSys... and other factors I may be missing .

--fuxi: working with boy on his problem sums is the least efficient item in my t-budget. 
A big red-flag item.
Need to control the tcost
I think a core issue is losing my cool
Once I lose my cool then better go to office

Overall, time spent coaching boy on his math has better roti than 
* watching TV/movie, 
* reading/watching news, 
* surfing, curiosity searching, 
* personal investment including huge t-spend on expense tracking, bx, and varioius account monitoring/analysis 
* micro-optimization on gadgets ...

I tend to hold highly negative views about my roti with kids (ditto with yoga, MSFM, c#), probably unfair bias. 

With yoga and with time spent on kids, I have a habit to adopt a stringent standard (in a blatant double-standard) that invariably casts a bad light on my effort. 
It's like pointing out the imperfections in a beautiful woman. 

So even if my renzi coaching did enhance his renzi abilities and comprehension, you won't see any improvement a few years later if he still refuses to apply his mind.

Q: is my zbs xx higher roti? Questionable.

Q: is my coding drill higher roti? It's 100% interview driven, and not relevant to GTD.

Q: how is the roti in c#, noSQL, meta-programming...?

--9 Nov I witnessed boy could read a Chinese story JiangXiaoYa fluently

--new: missed punches are more tiring than landed punches. 
I need to spend more time in office and reduce the wasted time/energy on boy. 

For every 10 minutes of facetime, my tcost is about 10 times including the blogging tcost, so I need to reduce these "hidden tcosts"

spend more hours in office when in a normal mood 

No need to get him to practice 7 days a week ... unrealistic

focus on result -- his actual practice.

--seems very hard to "work" at home while managing boy's math drill. Problem is context switching tcost
Not ready to give up yet.

Bigger problem is losing my cool

Need to find the "killer app" to make it work
How about workout as a burn?
How about english blogging?
How about FSM?
... somehow I tend to demonize all of the above !

Coding drill is not strategic either ! Workout is more strategic

I can record the time usage over a few evenings and ask "how could we improve? What's a better profile?"

--new: Jolt: go`home early4family time
I used to feel the “warm feeling” about going home early … some math with boy, some shopping, a bit of exercise but the utilization rate was always very disappointing.

I tried locking myself up in a room, with the earphone on. Still ineffective.
I tried connecting remotely. Still ineffective.
I feel sitting in MRT station or downstairs help to some extent, if I can do so for long enough.

Coming home early for family time never worked for me. It probably works for many peers but not me. 
No reason to feel shame, pity, or inferiority.
The best I could do in the evening open-house is ... see the open-house todo lists?

--fuxi: diet + tcost @ 22 Sep weekend@Vivo
! very conscious decisions so no regrets.

yong-toufu was good -- fibrous + lean. After that I had some leftover foods of medium calorie density

i made best use of the segments of spare time. What's the effectiveness? The laptop + printout did help.

How about the positive impacts on kids and wife?

wife surely feels better about me taking time out with family

--fxi: weekend family outing
exercise is burn ... hard burn
math practice and my coding drill is burn
tech xx is also burn, but less tough.

watch out my personal tcost. I could allocate it to 
* mlp prj + related self-xx
* coding drill
* c++/java QQ

--nothing new. integrate with t_focus@GTD and the 'timeMgmt' category in open blog
Yoga eats into work and family time..requires a lot of time including commute, preparation, arriving in advance and trying to read/blog there, (or kicked out) 

my time at home is limited:
* household chores -- leave to maid if possible
* time for boy
* multiplication table with memmei
* non-tech blogging+emailing is a huge contender
* tech xx including QQ, zbs, coding ... i would probably give up.

My hours in office are scarce :
* tech xx including QQ -- need to cut further. Might be tough and need optimization
* GTD -- camp out if in the mood
* localSys explore -- for long term productivity etc
* frequent breaks
* phone call to BJ

--fuxi: composing emails is slow-cooking. It need time (as Martin put it). It's time well-spent.
At work or at home, we should NOT rush.
