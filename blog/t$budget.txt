As I age, it is fundamental to increase the weightage on wellness, parenting, taking care of grandparents, marriage ...

For wellness, the huge effort may not produce visible effect !

As to parenting efforts, again huge tcost but slow improvement

--diet + tcost @ 22 Sep weekend@Vivo
! very consciously decisions so no regrets.

yong-toufu was good -- fibrous + lean. After that I had some leftover foods of medium calorie density

i made best use of the segments of spare time. What's the effectiveness? The laptop + printout did help.

How about the positive impacts on kids and wife?

wife surely feels better about me taking time out with family

keep 646 549 3446 at DBS, FSM to reduce office hour distraction

--nothing new. integrate with t_focus@GTD and the 'timeMgmt' category in open blog
Yoga eats into work and family time..requires a lot of time including commute, preparation, arriving in advance and trying to read/blog there, (or kicked out) 

my time at home is limited:
* household chores -- leave to maid if possible
* time for boy
* multiplication table with memmei
* non-tech blogging+emailing is a huge contender
* tech xx including QQ, zbs, coding ... i would probably give up.

My hours in office are scarce :
* tech xx including QQ -- need to cut further. Might be tough and need optimization
* GTD -- camp out if in the mood
* localSys explore -- for long term productivity etc
* frequent breaks
* phone call to BJ

--Q: how do I get more quiet time while living with family?  Note I need more quiet time than other fathers. I "bleed" more from the family distractions. 

Sugg: On some days, sleep early and catch earlier trains so I can study on trains; On other days, stay up late for quiet hours at night
Sugg: take half-day leaves to create half-day quiet periods at home. This feature isn't available to contractor

--new: the allure of late night quiet time #living with family

Q: what's the best use of early rise hours?
A: stay home (no distraction) .. can talk to wife. Avoid non-work activities in office

I often feel extremely lucky to get a quiet time after kids go to bed. It felt .. precious.

This quiet time is often inferior to other quiet times

* early rise quiet time is free of kids distraction. I can also talk to wife if I choose to.
* morning commute offers quiet time if I get to use git blogging
* In office I get plenty of quiet time .. early morning, after work, and during lunch break

I feel it's much better to sleep early and get up early. For now we can ignore the health benefits and focus on quiet time.

Consider taking mild sleeping pills to help me regulate. Consult a doctor
