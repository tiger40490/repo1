--consider going back to office in evening after boy's math drill
avoid family dinner

--should feel proud to fix the 0tiger40490 hotspot
but it's not worthwhile to speed up the lenovo$399 laptop. 

--5 Oct weekend in office
* no blogging except Eng vocab + a bit of nutrition
* sent out 2 x saved draft to Larry 
* created a new draft to Larry
* updated 2 drafts to Larry
* studied some fix tags related to my projects
* created a draft to Gary about diet
* some mini exercise
* spent time on normalization project

As soon as I start blogging, I should consider going home.

i tend to feel guilty about time usage [1] in office, but i feel worst at home.

[1] often up to 30% burn and up to 30% rot (like blogging, surfing, calling..)

--after weekend hours (not necessarily working) in office, I often feel less motivated on Monday.

honeymoon is best.

--qSG phase t-utilization in contrast to this hibernation: 
yoga? insufficient positive feedback, too much physical pain, slightly too much $cost pressure
.. how do I improve this time?
too much time spent with boy.. extremely low roti. Need to be more calculating on tcost. Beware of long journey
msfm? low roti. Huge tcost like 10~15h/week per subject
per investment? too much time on fsm + oanda
extra time in office? too much non-work

--a month into my hibernation, my time (i.e. laser, O2) still feels so precious
priorities? 

new job -- localSys, respect, ...
help my son's math exams
blogging -- analysis and juggling, like OS scheduler, competing with the tasks being scheduled
LG-recreation: time with meimei
LG-recreation: per-investment
LG2: discussion with friends. Email is far more efficient
LG2: discussion with grandparents
LG2: coding drill, 
LG2: c++maintenance? Lucky I could rely on the critical mass
LG2: yoga + workout? mini-workout is very time-efficient
+ food preparation: maid is great time-saver
+ commute is a huge time-saver
+ git-blogging + smemo-blogging whenever and wherever I have the inspiration

--biggest challenge during this hibernation -- very few proven, effective usages of precious personal time including plenty of leaves
* (safe default) more time in office to capture the absorbency, extend the honeymoon
* weight management? demands time and energy
* more frq exercise
* c++ critical mass maintenance, but without IV :(
? boy's academics? potentially frustrating
? QQ+zbs on cloud
? per investment, esp. on Robinhood?
? quant refresh?

--new: create(valuable)quiet time
Even though my son needs me, I still have to prioritize this need among other things such as my quiet time and localSys
early morning at home + MRT? Best quiet time. See blogpost on early rise
early morning in office, before colleagues come in 10am? slippery slope
evening in office? I tend to have momentum on localSys xx
after 11pm? Ini reality I need 30-60 minutes to enter the zone.

Yoga (and stadium) should really push (pun intended) out to weekends

--new: com`home early4family time
Coming home early for family time never worked for me. It probably works for many peers but not me. 
No reason to feel shame, pity, or inferiority.
The best I could do in the evening open-house is ... see the open-house todo lists?

-- sometimes the review of weekend hour utilization is counter-productive. Everyone's weekend is mostly "rot" not burn, including my role models. In fact those who "achieve" more than 3 hours of burning each weekend are probably fictional characters or doing something bad to their body and mind.

Probably they are focusing on something not so strategic or high-leverage, by my standard.

Steven Keith .. I really don't know what he does. I'm working with a whole theory based on just one sentence of anecdotal account.

Grandpa .. is 3 times more real as a role model but his weekends are not all burning.

Anyway, a fixation on burn/rot, leverage etc is mostly counterproductive

--important but not urgent:
flexibility
coding drill
c++ critical mass maintenance

--why no CIV? +ve Feedback loop is now broken
Out-ranked by
* parenting including boy's math. Detached supervision is hard. 
* family time? what is it?
* ramp up -- driven by respect, self-respect, honeymoon
* yoga

How about mini sessions like yoga, skip-rope, chin-up?

--I am so used to measuring roti in terms of gz including tech xx and work projects

As I age, it is fundamental to increase the weightage on wellness, parenting, taking care of grandparents, marriage ...

For wellness, the huge effort may not produce visible effect !

As to parenting efforts, again huge tcost but slow improvement

--diet + tcost @ 22 Sep weekend@Vivo
! very conscious decisions so no regrets.

yong-toufu was good -- fibrous + lean. After that I had some leftover foods of medium calorie density

i made best use of the segments of spare time. What's the effectiveness? The laptop + printout did help.

How about the positive impacts on kids and wife?

wife surely feels better about me taking time out with family

--family outings - vivo, east-coast, 
watch out my personal tcost. I could allocate it to 
* mlp prj + related self-xx
* coding drill
* c++/java QQ

--nothing new. integrate with t_focus@GTD and the 'timeMgmt' category in open blog
Yoga eats into work and family time..requires a lot of time including commute, preparation, arriving in advance and trying to read/blog there, (or kicked out) 

my time at home is limited:
* household chores -- leave to maid if possible
* time for boy
* multiplication table with memmei
* non-tech blogging+emailing is a huge contender
* tech xx including QQ, zbs, coding ... i would probably give up.

My hours in office are scarce :
* tech xx including QQ -- need to cut further. Might be tough and need optimization
* GTD -- camp out if in the mood
* localSys explore -- for long term productivity etc
* frequent breaks
* phone call to BJ

--sugg: budget time-for-boy?
If nothing planned, then go to office and ... work not xx or blog

--very hard to "work" at home while managing boy's math drill. Problem is context switching tcost

--Q: how do I get more quiet time while living with family?  Note I need more quiet time than other fathers. I "bleed" more from the family distractions. 

Sugg: On some days, sleep early and catch earlier trains so I can study on trains; On other days, stay up late for quiet hours at night
Sugg: take half-day leaves to create half-day quiet periods at home. This feature isn't available to contractor

--new: the allure of late night quiet time #living with family 
See also the blogpost on early rise

Q: what's the best use of early rise hours?
A: stay home (no distraction) .. can talk to wife. Avoid non-work activities in office

I often feel extremely lucky to get a quiet time after kids go to bed. It felt .. precious.

This quiet time is often inferior to other quiet times

* early rise quiet time is free of kids distraction. I can also talk to wife if I choose to.
* morning commute offers quiet time if I get to use git blogging
* In office I get plenty of quiet time .. early morning, after work, and during lunch break

I feel it's much better to sleep early and get up early. For now we can ignore the health benefits and focus on quiet time.

Consider taking mild sleeping pills to help me regulate. Consult a doctor
