Hi XR,

My dad passed away in peace, and now my Mom has decided to stay by herself in her high-end Beijing nursing home. For a while, my sister, my mom and I were discussing whether my mom should move to Singapore. 

Now I recall your stories living with your Mom in NY. 

* Language barrier .. Your mom had real language barriers even with grandchildren. My mom can speak to my kids but still there will be language barriers in Singapore.

* Caretaker .. My mom is 84, half-deaf, with hypertension, a stent, and early signs of short-term memory issues. She is laregely independent now, but does need help once a while. I feel lucky and confident about her well-trained caretakers in a professional nursing home.

In Singapore, she would likely live in her own rental space. I will visit her every week. I recall that you had some challenging experiences and fundamental differences in opinions with your Mom. My Mom is quite stubborn, and can become unreasonable every few days. 

In Singapore, 

Now I feel that every time I visit my mom in her Beijing nursing home, I feel happy to see her, but if she lives with me in Singapore she would become a dependent for me, and add real workload. I always value quiet time, and never want to take on extra workload. Our relationship may not remain so positively memorable and cherished. 

So I think the "comfortable but expensive" living arrangmeent is .. a Singapore nursing home. It costs 20% to 40% more than in Beijing. There are other drawbacks, but today I will focus on emotional conflict, family harmony and her social well-being. 

Living in a Singapore high-end nursing home, she can see me and her grandchildren easily. We would enjoy more family time with her. Perhaps in her 90s we can consider such an arrangement.
