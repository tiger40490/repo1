Hi Franz,

You made a few good points. 

what's the product name? Here are the main facts I have collected:

* I pay 5 annual premiums of 12k/Y, over 49 months (M1 M13 M25 M37 M49), and then wait for another 71 months
* surrender value is impractical within the initial (49+71) 120 months i.e. the prison term.
* my 60k would buy units of a chosen fund (switchable). 
* NAV of the units determine my surrender value at any given time after 10Y
* NAV x2 is the accidental death benefit 
* normal death benefit .. based on the 60k total premium, not NAV
* when I pass on, my family inherit the the units, not 60k cash
* monthly payout starts in M1, based on NAV
* both monthly payout rate and NAV change over time
* insured name .. would be one of my kids (probably daughter)... assigned to me.
* .. after some time, I may buy another policy for my other kid, possibly with higher premium
* (sustainable) payout .. is managed by PIMCO; death benefit is guaranteed by insurer. I guess surrender value is specified in the insurance contract and it is specified in terms of NAV.
