Hi Franz,

When we consider all the scenarios in the last will, we need to keep in perspective two basic questions: 

Q1: is this possibility meaningful or insignificant?

Q2: is the default outcome unacceptable?

Someone may write in her last will what to do if all known relatives are gone. Another person may document what to do if her designated recipient charity disappears before she dies. I consider those possibilities insignificant. 

Someone in my situation may worry about his assets flowing to the in-laws by default. I consider that outcome acceptable.
