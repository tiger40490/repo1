Compared to paper-blogging, git-blogging is inefficient due to polish? 
Well, in terms of over-polish, git is much better than WP blogging. With WP blogging, I feel the pressure to polish enough to be readable to myself. In contrast, in git, i can leave the content in barebones point form because I know I would revise it before publishing.

Better than web blogging (except merge-conflict), perhaps after 7pm.

1) Major slippery slope !
2) Risk of merge conflict.

Q: is git-blogging@workPC better than using my laptop in the pantry? 
A: controversial. Using my laptop, beside better merge conflict, I always follow a hard time limit. Using PC, other guys think I'm working. 

.. How about email-blogging? Eliminates merge conflict.

.. How about github.com-blogging? Reduces merge conflict.

.. How about git-printout? I can update either at home or on github.com.
