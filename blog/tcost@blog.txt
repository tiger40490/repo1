the tcost of blogging is comparable to the tcost of exercise (yoga/jogging/..), diet and nutritional research. Blogging is critical to diet (and exercise, to a lesser extent) because 

* my overall wellness and vitality is the #1 fundamental factor of my dev-till-70 plan, 
* weight is the (#1 factor) surprise tail that wags the dog, in my wellness
* the psychological element (hunger, temptation, motivation..) is the #1 most important challenge in my case. Temptation is the (#1) deciding factor and #1 obstacle to my diet
* blogging is my #1 essential effort on the psychological elements, esp. temptation.

Blogging is effective because diet (and exercise) is all about self-management, self-discovery, self-understanding, self-motivation, self-monitoring, self-adjustment, (I didn't say "self-discipline")

the tcost of blogging is a critical part of parenting, because the mindset, mentality ... of the parents is a fundamental part of the parenting challenge. 
Parents get emotional. Parents are imperfect humans. 
Some grow as parents by reading, discussing with partners and friends. I choose blogging.

ideas captured during home hours? Try to capture in git-blog. Then after brewing in git-blog for a while, update wp

gmail is an alternative ... if need to update on home laptop

ideas captured during work hours? Git-blog would become a slippery slope. A bigger slippery slope is WP blogging.

* first capture raw content in mslo task/draft. Can't easily transcribe to git-blog.
* Some content I can chew over in MSOL then post to WP outside work hour, but risk is slippery slope
* Some content I should simply send to gmail and post from home
* For the rest, Over weekend, select some content and transcribe to tmp NEW file on github, then sync to laptop

NEW file reduces risk of merge conflict.

my time allocation strategy, roti ... is crucial to my self-esteem/self-hate, satisfaction, regrets, emotional pains, 
In this battle, I can become more rational via blogging. Blogging takes lots of laser energy + time.

On a similar note, I can become more rational about my son's studies and weight, via blogging. Blogging takes lots of mental energy + time
