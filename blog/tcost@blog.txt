the tcost of blogging is comparable to the extra tcost of exercise (yoga/jogging/..) beyond the actual workout minutes, diet preparation, nutritional research... My reflective blogging is critical to diet (and exercise, to a lesser extent) because 

* my overall wellness and vitality is the #1 fundamental factor of my dev-till-70 plan, 
* weight is the (#1 wellness factor) surprise tail that wags the dog, in my case
* the psychological element (hunger, temptation, motivation..) is the #1 important challenge in my case. Temptation is the (#1) deciding factor and #1 obstacle to my diet
* blogging is my #1 essential effort on the psychological elements, esp. temptation.

My introspective blogging is effective because diet (and exercise) is all about self-management, self-discovery, self-understanding, self-motivation, self-monitoring, self-adjustment, (I didn't say "self-discipline")

--the tcost of blogging is a critical part of parenting, because the mindset, mentality ... of the parents is a fundamental part of the parenting challenge. 
Parents get emotional. Parents are imperfect humans. 
Some grow as parents by reading, discussing with partners and friends. I choose blogging.

I can become more rational about my son's studies and weight, via blogging. Blogging takes lots of mental energy + time

-- more j4 thinking/blogging about tcost, tbudget etc
my time allocation strategy, roti ... is crucial to my self-esteem/self-hate, satisfaction, regrets, emotional pains, 
In this battle, I can become more rational via blogging. Blogging takes lots of laser energy + time.

ideas captured during home hours? Try to capture in git-blog. Then after chewing in git-blog for a while, update wp in bulk

gmail is an (usually inferior) alternative ... if I update on home laptop only

ideas captured during work hours? Git-blog would become a slippery slope. A bigger slippery slope is WP blogging.

more tolerable is paper blogging 
more tolerable is MSOL soaking
more tolerable is blogging after 7pm 

* first capture raw content in mslo task/draft. Can't easily transcribe to git-blog.
* Some content I can chew over in MSOL then post to WP outside work hour, but risk is slippery slope
* Some content I should simply send to gmail and post from home
* For the rest, Over weekend, select some content and transcribe to tmp NEW file on github, then sync to laptop

NEW file reduces risk of merge conflict.
