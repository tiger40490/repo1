--new: git-blogging=best
sitting in ikea and watching my son playing... I realized that git-blogging helps me get into the "zone" faster, creates faster engagement and focus than paper-blogging, paper-reading etc.

Specifically, 
Editing long sentences, reviewing dozens (not half-dozen) of topics .. gets me into the zone faster.

In contrast,
* web-bloggig is really clumsy when editing more than 5 topics simultaneously.
I spend way too much time on titles ...
* recoll has a high cost in terms of file-naming 
* gmail-blogging system can't easily organize dozen's of topics

This is one moment to declare git-blogging is the highest form of expressive writing.

j4: self-esteem
j4: (LG2) "reputation" within team
j4: reward myself for early rise, early sleep

-- set up lenovo for commute? Would eliminate the "high cost low usage of Lenovo" zsms. Well, Take this chance to live without git-blogging.
