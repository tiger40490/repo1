When I told you about my increasing work load and work stress, you are right to point out that I often forecast my cash flow and prepare for "FIRE".

In my language, "FIRE" is 70% like financial independence retire early... more like "enough savings to stop working".

--My RMB 1560k to transfer out
20% of RMB 7800k = 1560k. This target will be the amount I want to transfer out of China. Optimistically, if we can transfer USD 50k x 2 (around RMB 700k) each year, 1560k will take 2 years+. I will keep track of each transfer since Aug 2024. 
You may want to keep RMB 500k in your HSBC China account, to avoid the monthly fee. You can even place 1Y time deposit there, and send the interest to Mom.
