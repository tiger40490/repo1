Hi Silvester,

No change in plan. Just some reflections.

I wrote earlier about "professionally managed" but poorly performing mutual funds, supposedly "safe" bond funds that take years to recover. Indeed my risk appetite has shifted. 

For decades, I pursued high returns in equity mutual funds. Now I favor SP500 ETF .. low cost, good return.

For decades, I pursuied high payouts in bond funds. Now I prefer "packaged fixed-income" assets that generate a "fixed income". As stated earlier, my and my mom's "fixed-income" assets include (approximately ranked by size)

RMB deposits in China
USD fixed deposits in Singapore and Cambodia
annuities (FWD, FLi150, FLi250,,,) ... lifetime payout, but rate not guaranteed
cpf .. lower liquidity
SGD savings accounts

Why this shift in risk appetite, towards "fixed-incomes"? I guess it's about aging. My mom doesn't have big ticket purchases but has fixed expenses. I have only a couple of big ticket purchases in mind.

Big-ticket: College funding... quarterly tuition to pay. Arguably similar to my mom's fixed expenses. Payer? Should be my kids themselves. I will help out but not out of resposibility or obligation.

Big-ticket: Property.. I have quite a few, but now I am unsure whether my kids should take over in my 80s or I will remain the steward. My wife wants to invest in additional properties but for what? Rental income or appreciation? 

If no big tickets purchases to plan for, then it's reasonable to aim for more "fixed income" assets.

To complement my growing fixed income portfolio, I should aim for a bigger SP500 allocation, like 500k to 1000k.
