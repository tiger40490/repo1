Hi Silvester,

No change in plan. Just some reflections.

I wrote earlier about "professionally managed" but poorly performing mutual funds, supposedly "safe" bond funds that take years to recover. I think my risk appetite has shifted decisively. 

For decades, I pursued high returns in equity mutual funds. Now I favor SP500 ETF (low cost)

For decades, I pursuied high payouts in bond funds. Now I prefer "packaged fixed-income" assets that generate a "fixed income". As stated earlier, my and my mom's deposit-like assets include (approximately ranked by size)

RMB deposits in China
USD fixed deposits in Singapore and Cambodia
annuities (FWD, FLi150, FLi250,,,) ... lifetime payout, but rate not guaranteed
cpf .. lower liquidity
SGD savings accounts

Why is this shift in risk appetite, towards "fixed incomes"? I guess it's about aging. My mom doesn't have big ticket purchases but has fixed expenses. I have just a few big ticket purchases in mind.

Big-ticket: College funding... quarterly tuition to pay. Somewhat similar to my mom's fixed expenses. Who to pay for it? Should be my kids themselves. I will help out if I can.

Big-ticket: Property.. I have quite a few, but now I am unsure if my kids should take over in my 80s or I will remain the steward. My wife wants to invest in additional properties but for what? Rental income or appreciation? 

If no big tickets purchases to plan for, then it's reasonable to aim for bigger "fixed income".
