Hi Silvester,

No change in plan. A bit more reflections of our discussion and my earlier emails. You need not reply. 

I wrote earlier about "professionally managed" but poorly performing mutual funds, supposedly "safe" bond funds that take years to recover. I'm unimpressed with those fund managers, but..
.. but SingLife and FWD are also fund managers, who manage long-term asset growth and perform "smoothing". I now rely on these professionals to keep up a consistent, reliable stream of income.

For decades, I pursued high returns in equity mutual funds. Now I favor SP500 ETF .. low cost, better return than most equality or bond funds. To complement my growing fixed income portfolio, I need to aim for a bigger SP500 allocation, like 300k or 500k.

For decades, I pursued high annual payouts in bond funds. Now I prefer "packaged fixed-income" assets that generate an sustainable income stream. As stated earlier, my and my mom's "fixed-income" assets include (approximately ranked by size): 

RMB deposits in China
annuities (FWD, FLi150, FLi250, FLi226) ... lifetime payout, but rate not guaranteed
USD fixed deposits in Singapore and Cambodia
cpf .. lower liquidity
SGD savings accounts

Why the recent shift in risk appetite, towards "deposit-equivalent" assets? I guess it's due to aging. My mom doesn't have big ticket purchases but has fixed expenses, so a fixed-income asset is suitable for her. In my case, I have only a couple of big tickets in mind: 

Big-ticket: College funding... quarterly tuition to pay. Comparable to my mom's fixed expenses, but bigger quantums. Payer? Should be my children themselves. I will help out of goood will, not out of obligation.

Big-ticket: Property.. I have quite a few, but now I am unsure whether my adult children should take over in my 80s or I will remain the steward. My wife wants to invest in additional properties but for what? Rental income or appreciation? We don't need either.

Big-ticket: (elephant in the room) major medical while unemployed/retired... In that situation, hopefully cpfMA + shield plans + critical illness plans will be enough. 

Note: Medical cost is not a heavyweight big-ticket as long as I'm employed. Many company medical insurance plans can reimburse a lot of medical costs. Many companies also have group insurance plans (critical illness, disability,,,) that pay out at a late stage.

If no big ticket purchases to prepare for, then it's reasonable/legitmate to look for higher regular incomes.

A new concern .. if I disappear without trace, then death benefit will not pay out to my family. I need to avoid those situations, such as solo adventures.

Q: if pressured, which annuities would I surrender first and last? My current precedence is
* surrender FLI150k .. incrementally .. Lowest payout_rate.
* surrender FLI226k .. incrementally
* surrender FLI250k (leveraged)
* surrender FWD300k (leveraged)
