-- new: Chinese IME ]windows
Win10 has a new Microsoft pinyin IME. I had to tick a checkbox to use the previous verison of thie IME. Otherwise, there's no suggestion of Chinese chars :(

-- new Printer driver install
After driver installation, sooner or later, we need an initial connection between the hardware. This is a frequent point of failure.

If cable is loose or printer is power-off, then you can check using device-manager -- unplugging/turning-off will remove an item immediately from device-manager; plugging/turning-on will add an item immediately to device-manager. Windows may also beep :) These are good signs. If you don't see any of these signs, then driver is broken or windows is broken.

Note Device manager is more low-level than Printers-n-scanners-page. It is able to show the new device earlier than PnSP can. Windows restart may be required before PnSP shows the new device.

Insufficient diskspace can mess up the installation in some strange way.

I prefer test-printing a single dot (notepad file). More ink-saving than a printer test page.
