It's a good habit to only mention hints, never full passwords.

The Nokia router has multiple ports, but it takes lots of legwork to set up MAC filtering.
Until that's done, I will keep the black Linksys router in operation.

The white tplink is confirmed required in the kitchen deadzone. Nokia signal strength is unreliable. No need for further test.

step: set up MAC filter on nokia, then retire the Linksys with its remote access 
step: wiring tidy-up is last last step. Once you tidy up the wiring, it's very hard to change the set-up.
