-- new: microSD for hosting Apps
MicroSD has a 2-3Y lifespan. For wechat data loss, the "recommended" protection is backup to laptop. I think this is a hard truth I may have to accept.

https://wiki.mlp.com/display/TECH/PMA+Server+%7C+QA+Deployment says

You might be wondering what the difference is between storing videos, audio and photos vs running apps. Storage is performed at sustained sequential write speeds. Data is received at a constant rapid speed and stored in a straight, orderly fashion. When running apps, bits of data are written randomly and placed wherever space is available. Hence, itâ€™s referred to as random read/write.

https://www.sdcard.org/developers/sd-standard-overview/application-performance-class/ made it clear that Class A1 and A2 were introduced specifically for APP-hosting.

One Simlim guy said that regardless of read/write spec of the SD card, your bottleneck might be the phone itself. Faster card won't help.

Other people also said that SD card read/write speed is for camera. Hosting apps like Wechat is suboptimal, possibly impratical. 

I think we should give classA2 a chance, before writing it off as unusable.

-- update bpost on printers
I want to train myself to reduce reliance on home printers, when office printing is feasible even if less convenient.

However, I also want to avoid ink dry-up.

The H-scrollbar auto-hides when no scrolling needed! With Ctrl/+ I was able to reveal it unconditionally.
