-- fuxi: in gmail, the 5 tabs are all part of "inbox". 
"skip inbox" will make the new message go straight to archive.

Compared to SocialTab, the "ForumTab" name is more vague, more versatile .. more suitable as tempUpdate

-- fuxi:
if a window dosesn't show up even though it is on the taskbar, then it's hidden somewhere. You can press 

control-shift and rightClick on the taskbar item.

-- fuxi: wireless@sg: attitude
Treat it as bonus. Don't rely on it.
