Tested solution: You can open vi on a new file, and close it (NOOP). Cursor may reappear.

-- new: spareware, free wifi
spyware can monitor your keystrokes and get your passwords.

As a best practice, I don't save my passwords in hints not clear text. This might be protective against spyware.

free wifi can be a honeypot to infect your devices. More often, a wifi operator eavesdrops on the passwords you send out.

Q: for you, which risk is worse between RR) ransomware and LL) data leak but not banking passwords
%%A: RR feels more severe

Immutable, password-protected offline backups are the best, though they increase the LL risk.

I feel my online blog is better than "local storage" in many ways including ransomware protection. I'm usulaly careful about sensitive data, so the LL risk is well-understood.

Ransomware mostly target enterprises, not home users.
WannaCry ransomware -- 230,000 computers infected across 150 countries

My friend pointed out that for most regular home computers, if data becomes encrypted and inaccessible, owner can buy a replacement computer and accept the data loss.

If the ransom is small I would pay it and learn a lesson.

"skip inbox" will make the new message go straight to archive.

Compared to SocialTab, the "ForumTab" name is more vague, more versatile .. more suitable as tempUpdate
