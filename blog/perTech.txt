-- new: android phone troubleshooting
On 23 Jan 2025, I found my cursor unmovable in Wechat. 

Whatsapp, SMS ... were unaffected. So it looked like an app-specific issue.

I was told to apps >> theApp >> storage >> ClearCache. ClearCache is confirmed safe (ClearData is dangerous)

-- update ..
Sometimes my mlphone personal-hotspot is enabled while in djdj, but invisible to my laptop. 
* ensure mlphone is not using another wifi SSID
* disable then enable personal-hotspot again

-- fuxi: if MSEdge horizontal scrollbar missing
The H-scrollbar auto-hides when no scrolling needed! With Ctrl/+ I was able to reveal it unconditionally.
