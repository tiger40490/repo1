Hi Silvester,

No need to reply. Just some reflections.

My total debt is growing to 400k+. It is arguablly smaller than some housing debts my friends carry. I don't know much about those mortgages so I won't compare [perhaps they have rental yield, or appreciation potential]. I am coming to terms with my personal debt level.. a learning/adjustment process that started with my FWD deal.

I shared with you my negative scenario planning -- leaving my high-stress high-paying job and relying on passive incomes such as rentals, deposit interests or FWD annual payout. In this negative scenario, the prem financing leverage is a double-edged sword. Set up to enhance my DYOC (dividend yield on cost), it could unexpectedly backfire. I may need to pay down the loans or surrender the policy, when my salary is much lower. Like in my earlier investments, I'm taking a calculated risk, walking in with my eyes wide open.

Small is beautiful. Now I feel the lower quantum (250k) is the most signifcant "improvement" over FWD, in long run. Small means flexible.

Partial surrender also means flexible. Next time we meet up, we should discuss partial surrender (Let's do some research). It's a harmless, possibly irrelevant feature. I didn't want to spend my limited mental resources digging into it during our 17 Dec meeting.
