Hi Silvester,

No need to reply. Just some reflections.

My total debt is growing to 400k+. It is arguablly smaller than some housing debts my friends carry. I don't know much about those mortgages so I won't compare [perhaps they have rental yield, or appreciation potential]. I am coming to terms with my personal debt level.. a learning/adjustment process that started with my FWD deal.

I shared with you my negative scenario planning -- leaving my high-stress high-paying job and relying on passive incomes such as rentals, deposit interests or FWD annual payout. In this negative scenario, the prem financing leverage is a double-edged sword. Set up to enhance my DYOC (dividend yield on cost), it could unexpectedly backfire. I may need to pay down the loans or surrender the policy, when my salary is much lower. Like in my earlier investments, I'm taking a calculated risk, walking in with my eyes wide open.

With the new Singlife PF deal, I think I was decisive and fairly efficient. 

Small is beautiful. Now I feel the lower quantum (250k) is the most signifcant "improvement" over FWD, if I focus on the long horizon. Small means flexible.

Partial surrender also means flexible. Next time we meet up, we should talk a bit about partial surrender (Please do some research if needed.). It's a harmless, possibly irrelevant feature. I didn't want to spend my limited mental resources unstanding it during my due diligence.
