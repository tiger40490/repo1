Hi Silvester,

No need to reply. Just some reflections.

My total debt is growing to 400k+. It is arguablly smaller than some mortgages my friends carry. I don't know too much about those mortgages so I won't compare [perhaps they have rental yield, or appreciation potential, or low interest]. I am coming to terms with this personal debt level.. a learning process that started with my FWD deal.

I shared with you my negative scenario planning -- leaving my high-paying job and relying on passive incomes such as rentals, deposit interests or FWD annual payout. The prem financing leverage is a double-edged sword. Supposed to enhance my DYOC (dividend yield on cost), it could also backfire. I may need to pay off the loans or surrender the policy, when my salary is much lower than now. Like before, I'm taking a calculated risk, walking in with my eyes wide open.

With this Singlife PF deal, I think I was decisive and fairly efficient. 

I bank with most of the Singapore retail banking brands. CIMB used to be one of the least relevant to me. Over a few years, it is now the most relevant.
