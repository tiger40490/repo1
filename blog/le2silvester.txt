Hi Silvester,

No need to reply. Just some reflections.

My total debt is growing to 400k+. It is arguabley smaller than some mortgages my friends carry. I don't know too much about those mortgages so I won't compare [perhaps they have rental yield, or appreciation potential, or low interest]. I am coming to terms with this personal debt level.. a learning process that started with my FWD deal.
