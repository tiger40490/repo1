--last thing to say?
If this scheme is identified as illegal MLM, then all participants (incuding the leaf level) are in breach of the law.

My police report would show that ZLH broke the law knowingly (Öª·¨·¸·¨). This is a more serios offense.

If convicted, it will affect your career in Singapore or other countries.

Reddit has a MLM list including legend age.

--acid test: refund
Personal agreement doesn't count.
Refund must clawback all the commissions paid to the uplines. A refund through a true MLM system would be hard to imagine.

--acid test: joining fee
Q: can you earn commission without buying inventory, like a property agent or car salesman

--be very respectful
stay focused and factual
stay cool and supportive
