Multiple investigators asked me what changed in Oct/Nov that led to the escalation of conflicts between Yixin and parents.

Answer 1: nothing changed that led to Yixin's mistreatment of Mom. Same behavior for a long time. Tension boiled over after I started calling police. I dared not do so when Yixin was cramming for O-levels. (He would be affected by police, or he could retaliate and threaten to skip an exam.)

Answer 2: The exam cram also emboldened him to stand firm against bathing and against early sleep, as if it would affect his mood for study. Yixin seemed to know exactly what he needs to do and what he must not do, in order to maximize cramming. His erratic study/sleep schedule also made him uninterested in family meals or unsweetened water. By the end of O-levels, parents had developed a strong perception of a stone-cold, irritable/ill-tempered, self-centered, self-isolated, self-sabotaging, deaf and stubborn teenager.

Answer 3: Yixing's existing anti-social behavior intensified during the O-levels. For example, he insisted on loud music as "I absolutely need it tonight, to study for tomorrow's exam." Other anti-social behaviors against family members
* blocking Mom going out
* snatching Mom's phone by force
* messing up sister's belongings in retaliation
* pushing 

Answer 4: exam cram disrupted our family bonding times. We used to have weekly family times -- cycling, beach fun, dining out, movie night, game night. (I used to have regular chats with Yixin after midnight.) I get the sense (without evidence) that this "wheel" ground to a halt sometime in August 2024. After O-levels, the wheel is tentatively restarting. We had a bit of family outing within Singapore, but Yixin appeared determined to have it "my way, or no way". It became more vocal during Tokyo family trip.

Yixin would arrive at airport an hour later than the family .. deliberately late. Once, he insisted on taking subway by himself while the rest shared a taxi to airport. More than once he arrived right before gate closing, after all other passengers. 

At transit airport, Yixin had no mobile phone connectivity but he decided to explore the airport on his own, against parent advice. When boarding started, we couldn't find him. The entire plane waited for him. He was unapologetic, though he learned his lesson.

Similar behavior at remote train stations outside Tokyo... He refused to travel with family, and decided to arrive at train stations by himself close to departure time. (Next departure was hours away.)

Most infuriating -- at Owakudani, family was in a hurry to catch a 4pm cablecar. Yixin bluntly refused to finish his icecream (disallowed on cablecar) in time, and deliberately missed that 4pm cablecar. (I was trembling with anger.) I took the 4pm cablecar by myself to avoid physical fight over his icecream. Mom decided to wait for Yixin, and boarded a later cablecar, even though she worried about missing the connecting train.

Note this is our first Japan trip. All illiterate. Yixin carried limited cash and no credit cards. His phone was often low-battery. He knew parents were worried every time. He seemed to shrug it off like "I know what I'm doing. I can come home by myself" eve in the cold weather. In these stories, he was repeatedly reminded, but rejected, the common practice of "buffer" and margin of safety. It reminds me of teenage drivers speeding at the legal limit on an empty highway, without seat belt, eating lunch while watching live sports. 

Whenever family was looking for a dinner place, Yixin would take 20 to 40 minutes searching. He would dismiss dozens of restaurants. Frequently, other family members would tell him "hungry" and "Make up your mind in 10 minuets" but he would act deaf. Half the time, I gave up after following him over 10 minutes [1], and returned to hotel by myself, in protest or in disgust.

Tokyo subway trains have last train timing around midnight. Yixin would frequently aim at those, knowing the risk of missing the last train. This risk was worse when night temperature dropped towards zero, and Yixin's sister and mother had no choice but follow him around (because they can't navigate Tokyo subway). Most of the time, they were unable to persuade Yixin to return before midnight. I suspect that if Mom had insisted, then Yixin would have sent them home (i.e. to hotel) earlier -- not exactly "my way or no way". Once, he did send them home earlier.

The parenting advice of "Picking battles" .. looking back, I could learn to pick my battles with my son. His actions and behaviors ranged from inconsiderate, irresponsible, annoying, to infuriating. Some actions are dangerous to himself, whereas other actions affect the entire family. 

* Whenever I left the scene on my own, I was choosing to run away from the battle. FLIGHT rather than the FIGHT response. 
* When I set a 10-minute deadline for myself in the [1] scenario, I had already decided not to fight that battle.
* When I followed my daughter's advice "say nothing when Yixin shows up", I was choosing to avoid that battle. 

In an earlier email, I wrote "Today (30 Sep) when I reached home, I saw food residue below Yixin's nose, a peanut-sized residue of chocolate. Mom told me he had refused to wash it off. I scolded him, tried to force him to clean himself, and then calmed down to persuade him.  Nothing worked. He refused to even look at me." In December, after Tokyo, he has developed similar behavior.. he has stopped brushing teeth, in addition to no-shower, no-hair-wash. 

I don't know if the recent dentist visit was a factor. Yixin saw orthodontist Dr Ong in 2023, to evaluate cosmetic treatment. Yixin is now motivated to improve his appearance, so in early Dec 2024 I brought Yixin back to Dr Ong. Again, Dr Ong reminded Yixin of oral hygiene during (typically 2Y) treatment. Dr Ong gave many details of how and why, but was not long-winded or "nagging". Yixin listened quietly. Afterwards, Dr Ong told me that Yixin should get a dental scaling soon, before we start any treatment. 

My sense is that Yixin decided to test the boundary around yet another standard advice (this time from an authority besides his parents). Here are other examples of standard advice that has fallen on deaf ears:

* arrive at O-levels exam venue 30 minutes in advance
* prepare exam equipment 24H in advance, not on the 11th hour
* arrive at airport at least 2 hours in advance
* while waiting to board a flight, stay with family, rather than going far out on your own without a phone
* personal wellness: eat healthy food, rather than fried, sugary food/drinks
* personal wellness: drink plain water, rather than sugary beverage. Parents have warned him of diabetes risks, every month.
* personal hygiene: daily shower
* personal hygiene: clean your face after eating a messy food .. the example above
* personal hygiene: change your clothing after it gets visibly dirty
* anti-social: play loud music past midnight
* anti-social: turn off loud music on your phone or walk away, when family is watching a home movie and unable to hear dialog
* anti-social: don't let people wait for you on the street, 45 minutes beyond an agreed time
* anti-social: after a family outing decision (30-minute debate), do not change direction midway for no reason. If other people object to your new direction, then follow the original family decision, rather than going your way (my way or no way).

As I write the list above, I feel physical tension build up inside my chest. My breathing becomes shorter and shallower. I feel the urge to punish my son, so that he can feel the same pain. I feel pissed off. I feel he is such a pain in the ass. I have to stop writing for a while.

There were also positive changes in Yixin during the Tokyo trip. He did take a few showers in the hot-spring at the Tokyo hotel. He did get up early on some mornings, to join family trips in Tokyo. (He used to be uncooperative and get up hours after everyone else, forcing everyone to wait for him.) I'm most grateful for the late night sleep. On the first 2 nights I didn't sleep well due to various noises he made. Subsequent nights, he continued to stay up until 3am, but he kept quiet for me to sleep. I thanked him.

Mom thanked Yixin repeatedly for guiding the family through the Tokyo subway maze. I have a bit of reservations here, because Yixin never explained why he chose a particular route, often against staff advice... "My way or no way." More than once, I argued with him and decided to follow staff direction and arrived by myself. It turned out Yixin's routes were almost equally fast. I think such outcomes helped him earn Mom's trust, but it's dangerous to go against official advice, esp. during a first visit to a country of unfamiliar language and customs. I guess I picked my battle correctly -- questioning, arguing, and leaving on my own.
