I don't think many people decide to write threading code in C (or Fortran). Threading is a mid-level feature, but C is low-level language.

threading in C is low-level, complicated, error-prone... but paradoxically low market-value. I think it's because java (possibly c#) has cornered the market with much better threading support. C++ support is somwhere between java's and C's in terms of ease , training, developer availability.

In terms of efficiency, java is suprisingly good. That's why threading is popular in java, not in python, php, ruby etc.
