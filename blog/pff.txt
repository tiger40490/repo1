Given my growing cash pile, what are the real cashflow risks?

* scam
* investment failures.. I hit a few up to the JillLim case.
* job loss. Over the decades, I'm well-prepared mentally and financially
* salary drop (without job loss).. My conviction: unlikely.
* USD or RMB devaluation.. My conviction: I think SGD will NOT grow so strong
* prolonged excessive inflation .. I have seen only once in my lifetime, 2023-2024 but not prolonged.

Also, compare to most developed country rEstate (including Sg), my quantum is very much manageable.
I don't have a big big chunk stuck in one unit.
Travel cost is very affordable
I also stopped overseas rEstate after 2019
