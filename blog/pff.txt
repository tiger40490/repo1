-- update wcpay/alipay bpost
Beware over-dependency on alipay/wcpay. They tend to be more complex and have more restrictions than POS or offline cash

Another reason to prefer e-payment:

Some unscrupulous taxi drivers or vendors may quickly switch your genuine banknote for a fake one and then return the fake banknote to you and tell you the money you gave them is fake. They usually do this with 100 yuan notes since they are most valuable, although it may happen with 50 yuan notes too. Because of this, we suggest travelers in China keep some 10 or 50 yuan banknotes for small payments and avoid using 100 yuan notes when taking taxis or making small transactions.

-- update or new: enough nest egg2retire@current burn rate 
Claim: you can and need to invest in stocks since young.
My take: Only U.S. stocks...

Observation: many countries' public pension-like system pays you only a fraction of you "current burn rate"

My Rule #1: be realisitc about retiring in style, and don't aim at current burn rate. Exclude housing and healthcare, aim at half the current burn rate.

My Rule #1b: from young age, take up the legwork to find long-term solutions for old age housing and healthcare.

XianHua said a U.S. retiree in his case 
* receives $1400/M from SSA
* pays about $1500/M pTax if owning a home

Sg offers a more affordable retirement, in terms of Melvin3.

More frequent usage of (and carrying) paper money increases risk of loss
but it gives me better feel for the outflow.
I think this risk is an inherent risk with paper money, to be accepted and managed.

sugg: pay offlines for all small amounts.
sugg: keep $50 notes in several places like office, cockpit1, cockpit4
