-- I need a base plan for the FBF. Some can take a baseplan of LG and deal with any FBF that kicks in. I don't feel comfortable about this plan.

Plan: move some 20k from EGA .. I don't like this as it is too "dumb" and unwise.
Plan: risk $5 FBF on dbsMP, and dump 12k to citi to ensure TRB .. I don't like this because it feels too paranoid. TRB once reached 45k...
So it looks like I have to track TRB. TRB Tracking is a can of worm that I wanted to avoid. 

Without tracking TRB, I can't justify moving anything from EGA

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/crypto-ftx-sbf-bankrupt-crash-binance-3068201 says
The value in crypto was supposed to be that it offered a hedge to the dollar or more conventional parts of the market. Or that it would hold up in value if everything else fell. But an asset that offers that kind of hedge is rare; most assets are somewhat correlated, especially when the market drops. Rareness normally means an expensive asset that offers a lower return. You pay a big price for that kind of safety and itâ€™s hard to find.
The fact that crypto offered such high returns indicated it was never a good hedge.

Trigger: Singapore consumer education promotes public transport, walk, cycle, rather than private cars.

The wellness factor (including mental) and eco factor are background heat (a home-grown term not laden with meanings).

Some frequent drivers (7+ trips/wk) may pass all health screenings. If you are one of them, you may not care about the backgroune heat. 
You may feel your "system" copes with the background heat.

Over decades, these factors tend to grow /heavier/, less negligible, and accmulate an enduring (positive/negative) effect on a person's life chances and well-being.

Related to "return", another major tcost and stressor is keeping track of "stuff bought and disused long ago".

When I lose such an item (perhaps at home or discarded), and have to buy again, I feel an acute self-hate.

More frequent usage (and carrying) paper money increases risk of loss

It's hard to find property in SG below market value, but some sReits trade below NAV.

How are market value and NAV computed?

-- Steven's checklist for SgCP (buying): 
1. understand your risk level
2. budget
3. understandd your "purpose" .. like income or windfall
4. holding period
5. location .. comes after those 4 introspections
6. exit plan

Given the large quantum, I think a single SgCP investment can affect your entire family over decades or over generations. Therefore, it require lots of introspection and soul-searching.

If it still feels uncomfortable, then the quantum is too large for you, or the uncertainty is too high for you.

-- freehold units are more costly, therefore lower yield.

-- new: Sg strata mall units
windfall appr is hard for strata units. In other words, expensive. 

Also hard to fill. Brand new strata mall ... don't buy.

Reit is "totally different" from physical SgCP

-- FnB unit psf rent (not GRY) is higher than shops.
If unprofitable, FnB tenants tend to find takeover tenants, while shop tenants tend to give up the lease. Even a long-term lease may not provide much protection. 3Y is usually the max.

Exhaust provision is a key feature for FnB units, more important than waterpoint.

-- Steven's 3 points for SgCP buying: 1) tenanted 2) tenant profile 3) NRY
If agent says a vacant (office, industrial, shop...) unit can be rented out as xxxx or yyyy, then ask the agent to rent out first before you evaluate the unit.

-- Reit ETFs?
diversify to other countries? Most of my Reits are US. One is SG. No other countries.

I can buy a few shares of Reit ETF (actually any SGX ETF) to try.

pre-clearance ? some of these have > 25 holdings.

SGX reit etf has high expRatio than US reit ETF! Need to find out the US numbers.
