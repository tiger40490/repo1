Some x percept of the rich individuals would each allocate some y percent of their risk capital to BTC. Even when they face a 90% paper loss, most of them don't mind holding, and don't mind 100% loss.

This "risk appetite" is common among investors (gamblers?) including me.

-- update bpost on syfe
Each TD (aka ptf) needs manual toggle to disable rollover. After maturity, you need to manually transfer P+I to your bank account. 

(After rollover, you lose liquidity.)

-- new or update 
I recall a bitter and regrettable claim experience about 10 years ago. (I describe it here partly to remind myself.) 

* my son had somd Aviva medical insurance. Annual deductible is a standard feature so I didn't pay attention. Actually it was a killer feature.

* my son had some testicle pain and was admitted to KKH for one day (or half a day). As a local citizen, government hospital bill was below $1k

* I sent the bill to Aviva only to find out the bill amount is much lower than the annual deductible.

* worst thing --> Aviva recorded my son's condition and refused to underwrite any medical insurance on him from then on. I went back to KKH about 2 or 3 times to get clarification, even paying for medical reports. KKH said "quickly discharged and no follow-up required." but Aviva refused to accept. It became a life-long stigma, even though my son made a full recovery soon.

Lesson 1 -- insurance companies are faceless organizations. Underwriters are risk averse and will not underwrite any questionable applicant. "If in any doubt, reject". I think this is similar to the hiring process in my and other companies.

Lesson 2 -- Once a person has some questionable scan recorded in "the national system", it can be hard for any doctor in Singapore to examine a new scan and declare "100% fully recovered.. absolutely no risk". Therefore, if a questionable scan doesn't HaveTo be recorded in the national system, then it's wise to avoid it, provided it's not illegal/immoral

-- AIA bigger plan (for wife) has SGD 30k for CI-early

If we stop paying prem, then AIA will deduct $28/M charges by redeeming from the investment portion.

SRS to pay for AIA premium? No

Advantage of physical over electronic USD cash -- competitive FX rate at /ffP/. (Not so relevant when I have surplus SGD in the foreseeable future.)
To use it, you must pick a date decisively, and subsequently refuse to give in to regret.

Note every "3M parking in locker" leads to 1% lost interest (opp cost)
Also, you need a safe storage at home .. during those few months .

Default plan -- deposit and pay 0.5% handling fee. You can "recover" within 1.5 month, thanks to the current high-interest.

Citi 0.5% (min USD 10) but only one branch
.. CitiGold (250k) -- 0.25% only.
Hsbc Premier 0.75%
BOC 1%
DBS, OCBC .. even worse

https://www.sc.com/sg/save/current-accounts/usd-high-account/ (priority clients) .. 1.5% waived :)

-- update old-age BBB/RRR complexity
Ranking in terms of complexity and tcost of ownership: 
RBBT ownership has better stress-cost thanks to the pre-payment option.
FLI2 and other bx products.. obligation to pay premium on time, but you are free to pay earlier or slightly later.
promotional DIR like 3.7 ppa .. obligation to recon interest calc.
HSBC 3.6 ppa .. many conditions. Many headaches if I want to avoid losing the interest
tBill ownership cost is even lower.

Since 2010s I have had a consistent assessment that pff is my strongest hand, strongest tectonic plate, and my "best-performing" game, in terms of personal efficacy, battery, accumulation,,,

Money can be kept in a bank and preserved, like batteries. (Few other things can.) Inflation is the enemy.
Money is one thing I can pass to my kids. If I stay healthy, I can provide stewardship of a multi-gen reserve.

Luckily for me, there are non-financial "legacies" in which I have confidence. I spent lots of time with my kids and influence them.

Q: r-ikigai?

If you want to maximize cpfLife, then
1) top up cpfRA to the max (4x BRS) at 55
2) don't withdraw. Let it grow at 4%. Your max cpfRA balance will grow faster than the ERS_index grows.

-- fuxi: How do I feel about terminating the Citi SMRT card? 
Freedom from worry about annual fee
Freedom from anxiety over large credit limit

-- fuxi or update (which) bpost on inflation
I see the huge effort by PAP government to manage inflation and preserve purchasing power of the national currency.
Now I feel very low inflation is unnatural, unsustainable (in an inflationary global ecosystem) and potentially harmful to the local economy.
