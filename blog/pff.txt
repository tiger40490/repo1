-- new: inheritance
Both children will visit icbc Together

-- new: Grandma's j4w4reserve
j4w4 means 境外. j4w4reserve belongs to grandma 100%

Obvously I need to keep track of all the transfers from grandma's ICBC to j4w4reserve, and record j4w4reserve balance

Any surplus Rmb deposit can be part of j4w4reserve

When SGD/RMB drops AND RMB DIR improves, I can convert some SGD to RMB and record it as j4w4reserve

-- update "lock up100k]cpf"
college funding is not a one-time big-ticket, more like quarterly big payment
-- update bpost on PFL .. is a monthly rent to let me own and grow the cashcow . When the cashcow starts producing milk it stops growing

-- new: sustainable long-term return{annities
I have bought three annuities. Additionally, cpfLife is a "descending annuity"

Q: what's a sustainable (annualized) return before expensens?

Note this return rate is very different from (usually higher) the more visible payout_rate.

HsbcLWA seems to feature 8~9 ppa. I think it's unsustainable.

-- new: Channel1k [USD1k/D for foreigners]
Original purpose is "SAFE assumes a foreigner has converted USD to RMB. Now you are allowed to convert back to USD"
HSBC actually requires proof of the earlier convert. 

Each passport holder must be present at the branch. 

Q: is it illegal to exchange for USD 1k every day?
A: clearly legal and not prohibited

Each bank usually starts rejecting your request before SAFE intervenes. You can then go to another bank.

The Xiamen lady June.Zhang told me it's ok to exchange for USD 1k/D at her money changer, higher cost than at banks, but more frequency supported.

Q: what if I get on the SAFE watch list
J.Z: SAFE approval is required during the cash exchange. If SAFE real time system identifies the customer's ID (passport or IC) as a watched ID, then the guy will be turned away. There should be no criminal charge for 1k/D alone without some suspicious activities

Q: what if I get on the radar but not the watch list? No answer.
J.Z: her money changer firm is authorized to sell USD to such a foreigner. China citizens are monitored more than foreigners.

-- fuxi: despite all the challenges in khm, I still feel lucky about USD demomination + local marketing agency + locally known developer + CapitaLand endorsement

Also, compare to most developed country rEstate (including Sg), my quantum is very much manageable.
I don't have a big big chunk stuck in one unit.
Travel cost is very affordable
I also stopped overseas rEstate
