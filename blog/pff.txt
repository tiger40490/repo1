A similar experience to share -- Mixed vegetable-rice (杂菜饭) is my default choice when I eat alone. In June 2024 I went to a low-cost street venue (without Aircon), and bought a regular 杂菜饭 -- two-veg-one-meat for $5.50. Used to cost $3.50 ~$4, perhaps 10 years ago. 

I need to cut down on this kind of meal ..  not worth the price. (I can settle for one fewer item). 

For a historical comparison I need to hold every variable constant:
* location .. food court (with Aircon) is my current default. Frequently, I do choose cheaper place like this June venue
* portion .. one-meat-one-veg-on-rice (一菜一肉) is always my default. Frequently, I do get 1 or 2 additional items like this June case

$2-$3 was my cost level some (20) years ago. Now the same food costs $5. When I see a price display of $6 for 杂菜饭, I get a sinking feeling (心里一沉) and immediately I urge myself to cut down to one-meat-one-vet-on-rice. Less often, I would tell myself I'm not really hungry and can wait until I reach office or home, where low-cost healthy foods await.

Q: how much would the same food cost (in the same place) in 2035? Probably below $7. My optimism.

My son may start working full time in 5 years, without a degree, and make $3k/M. $6 a meal translates to about $15/day. With that salary he has to cut down on food cost.

Even though food is an essential expense, food inflation is my least worry because ... many (reasonably healthy) choices exist. In contrast, I care more about medical, housing+utilities, public transport.

-- fuxi or new: fraud detection.. account unlock
Automatic account lockdown due to unusual activities... is a global trend pioneered by China. Highly inconvenient for millions of innocent user. I choose to believe that these evolving systems do prevent a lot of scams.

Unlocking can be a big headache.

Singapore banks are by far the easiest. I can visit branches. They can see the real person with official ID cards.

Singapore online-only platforms... I can call them easily. I can even ask police to step in though much slower. Police can see the real person and give authorization to unlock. 

Unlocking is tougher when you are overseas i.e. without your physical presence. You need to prepare for IDD costs.

Account unlock is toughest with China online-only platforms having zero branches... alipay and wcpay

China banks .. have 24x7 hotlines. Last resort -- I can visit branches when I fly in (every few months).

-- update bpost on long-term SG inflation
K.Hu suggested roaming retirement to Malaysia. Singapore is susceptible to imported inflation but not Malaysia.
Switzerland citizens don't have a next-door neighbor as a low-cost retirement destination. (Spain?) Sgp has JB.

Some x% annual inflation over some 15Y translate to perhaps 50% commulative inflation in Sgp. Malaysia cost level is much lower and will address that level of commulative inflation.

SGX blue chip stocks are an inflation hedge. 

STI ETF? has expRatio, inferior to single names

SP500 ETF is a classic inflation hedge.

practice log-in once a month. Slightly easier to recover lost password than ICBC

After you reinstall mobank, you  need to enter your existing passwd twice, then recreate mobilePIN. 

deposit USD .. 50k/Y limit, spaced out[2]
There's no FOC way to get more USD into hsbc.cn. USD transfer from another bank is unlikely to be FOC. I am not allowed to buy USD as a foreigner, except the "emergency $500"

[2] Too-frequent deposits may attract unwanted attention. Luckily counter staff would remind customers before it happens.

AIA bigger plan (for wife) has SGD 30k for early-CI
If we stop paying premium, then AIA will deduct $28/M charges by redeeming from the investment portion.

SRS to pay for AIA premium? No

Even with very low annual income, I should start HRBlock process as early as possible. Every week counts towards stress reduction and stress prevention.

-- fuxi:
I worry about my kids falling for the financial trap of debt; I worry about grandparents falling for scams.... but I'm not supersmart, super vigilant, immune to impulsive decision

To address those concerns, an asset can go under joint-signature custody. Example is the HDB flat.

CPF account is slighlty safer against scams.

compared to my SGD accounts, my USD accounts are slight less prone to impulsive actions.

Our insurance plans are less prone to quick liquidation
* AIA
* Prudential
* shield plans, ADL plans have miniml surrender values anyway
