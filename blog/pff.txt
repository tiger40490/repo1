When I told YY and YYT that I can retire with enough savings + NNIA, what they don't know is my salary. 

Mathematically, my current salary is a null term in the retirement equation, where the income side consists solely of NNIA. So why is current salary actually crucial?

A: If they find out my income is 5k vs 50k, then this info immediately anchors their assumptions about my current burn rate. They would have some idea about my retirement equation amounts.
A: my current salary remains a huge factor affecting my motivation to stay employed rather than early retirement.
A: As I told each audience, my ffree is mathematically barebones, based on low burn rates. Therefore, each time I get a salary, it strengthens my nest egg and improves my retirement "high ground".

Tracking monthly savings amount .. a G8 priority.
U.S. pff advice is "Follow monthly savings goals" but I don't need such self-discipline. 

The increment between liquid_NAV snapshots is a nominal savings amount, but it excludes II (monthly investment amounts). Even if I add the II, the savings amount is still way off.

Tracking the actual savings amount becomes /unrewarding/ legwork with poor leverage. 
In contrast, exp recon has high tcost and high leverage.

Claim: you can and need to invest in stocks since young.
My take: Only U.S. stocks...

Observation: many countries' public pension-like system pays you only a fraction of you "current burn rate"

My Rule #1: be realisitc about retiring in style, and don't aim at current burn rate. Exclude housing and healthcare, aim at half the current burn rate.

My Rule #1b: from young age, take up the legwork to find long-term solutions for old age housing and healthcare.

-- update which bpost?
how many percent of Singaporeans have an exp recon system with 1-decimal precision i.e. 0.1k i.e. $100

This is a precise question. I would guess below 1%.

XianHua said a U.S. retiree in his case 
* receives $1400/M from SSA
* pays about $1500/M pTax if owning a home
* pays about $1000/M health insurance, much needed in old age

Sg offers a more affordable retirement, in terms of Melvin3.

With my increased Base salary (bonus is different story), how should we adjust our spending, savings etc?
* sugg: increase wealth accu for wife. cpfVcon is probably the most restrictive
* sugg: rebuild my cash reserve

More frequent usage of (and carrying) paper money increases risk of loss
but it gives me better feel for the outflow.
I think this risk is an inherent risk with paper money, to be accepted and managed.

sugg: pay offlines for all small amounts.
sugg: keep $50 notes in several places like office, cockpit1, cockpit4

It's hard to find property in SG below market value, but some sReits trade below NAV.
