-- update bpost on exp recon priorities
Tracking monthly savings amount .. a G8 priority.
Task is complicated by  investment amounts 

U.S. pff advice is "stick to monthly savings goals" but I don't need this discipline. So tracking the actual savings amount becomes extra legwork with poor leverage. 
In contrast, exp recon has high tcost and high leverage.

-- update or new: enough nest egg2retire@current burn rate 
Claim: you can and need to invest in stocks since young.
My take: Only U.S. stocks...

Observation: many countries' public pension-like system pays you only a fraction of you "current burn rate"

My Rule #1: be realisitc about retiring in style, and don't aim at current burn rate. Exclude housing and healthcare, aim at half the current burn rate.

My Rule #1b: from young age, take up the legwork to find long-term solutions for old age housing and healthcare.

-- update which bpost?
how many percent of Singaporeans have an exp recon system with 1-decimal precision i.e. 0.1k i.e. $100

This is a precise question. I would guess below 1%.

XianHua said a U.S. retiree in his case 
* receives $1400/M from SSA
* pays about $1500/M pTax if owning a home
* pays about $1000/M health insurance, much needed in old age

Sg offers a more affordable retirement, in terms of Melvin3.

With my increased Base salary (bonus is different story), how should we adjust our spending, savings etc?
* sugg: increase wealth accu for wife. cpfVcon is probably the most restrictive
* sugg: rebuild my cash reserve

More frequent usage of (and carrying) paper money increases risk of loss
but it gives me better feel for the outflow.
I think this risk is an inherent risk with paper money, to be accepted and managed.

sugg: pay offlines for all small amounts.
sugg: keep $50 notes in several places like office, cockpit1, cockpit4

It's hard to find property in SG below market value, but some sReits trade below NAV.
