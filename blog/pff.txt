-- new: sustainable long-term return{annities
I have bought three annuities. Additionally, cpfLife is a "descending annuity"

Q: what's a sustainable (annualized) return before expensens?

Note this return rate is very different from (usually higher) the more visible payout_rate.

HsbcLWA seems to feature 8~9 ppa. I think it's unsustainable.

-- update which bposts on max out cpfLife (P1?)
payout will start at 65. I wish to receive higher payout, to strengthen livelihood security. That requires me to top up to ERS at 55, 65 or sometime in between.

If I hit ERS at 55, then liquidity suffers! I lose some 250k liquidity for 10Y! I may need that money for kids' education, a new home etc...

Q: can both of us hit ERS? Unlikely because it would require SGD 1000k cash.
Q: so who has priority to hit ERS? Me since my payout starts early, but she would feel more secure if payout is under her name.

A higher priority is .. hitting FRS when wife turns 55.

Suppose I cash top-up to wife's SA before her 55th birthday. (Total 200k). Her combined OA+SA hits FRS watermark. Then the FRS amount goes into RA. 

Any residual OA (salary contribution or interest) is immediately withdrawable. Like a bank account. No restriction like 'SA top-up amount is not withdrawable'.

Also, compare to most developed country rEstate (including Sg), my quantum is very much manageable.
I don't have a big big chunk stuck in one unit.
I also stopped overseas rEstate 

-- ask cpf on next appt
Maximum amount you can top up (to spouse) using CPF - $43,946.14 ???
A: perhaps OA -> wifeSA

I want my wife to feel more secure with cpfLife payout. How can I make my payout go into her bank account?
No answer

Will Basic plan be available when I want to choose it like age 65?
A: no guarantee
