Since 2010s I have had a consistent assessment that pff is my strongest hand, strongest tectonic plate, and my "best-performing" game, in terms of personal efficacy, accumulation,,,

Money is one thing I can pass to your kids. If I stay healthy, I can provide stewardship of a multi-gen reserve.

Luckily for me, there are non-financial "legacies" in which I have confidence. I spent lots of time with my kids and influence them.

I see the huge effort by the government (among many national governments) to manage inflation and preserve purchasing power of the national currency.
Now I feel deflation or very low inflation is unnatural, unsustainable (in an inflationary global ecosystem) and potentially harmful to the local economy.

Money can be kept in a bank and preserved. Very few other things can.

Q: r-ikigai?

-- fuxi or update which bpost?
grandparents have financial freedom due to healthcare and SGD 4k+ of pension. This ffree is a big advantage esp. to the adult children, but it doesn't really make their lives a bliss.

* Citi.sg USD 3690 TD renewable even though that amount was then below SGD 5k
* I am earning monthly interest > USD 50, visibly
* MLP allows me to keep Rbh and all the positions.
