even without smrz, wife's alipay account (CC account) can use international ccard for payment. However, this card is usualy not usable in taobao. Instead taobao acct must bind alipay acct, but it can bind international ccard without going through alipay acct

Each passport/IC holder can have three alipay accounts.

-- update bpost on long-term SG inflation
K.Hu suggested roaming retirement to Malaysia. Singapore is susceptible to imported inflation but not Malaysia.
Switzerland citizens don't have a next-door neighbor as a low-cost retirement destination. (Spain?) Sgp has JB.

Some x% annual inflation over some 15Y translate to perhaps 50% commulative inflation in Sgp. Malaysia cost level is much lower and will address that level of commulative inflation.

SGX blue chip stocks are an inflation hedge. 

STI ETF? has expRatio, inferior to single names

SP500 ETF is a classic inflation hedge.

practice log-in once a month. Slightly easier to recover lost password than ICBC

After you reinstall mobank, you  need to enter your existing passwd twice, then recreate mobilePIN. 

deposit USD .. 50k/Y limit, spaced out[2]
There's no FOC way to get more USD into hsbc.cn. USD transfer from another bank is unlikely to be FOC. I am not allowed to buy USD as a foreigner, except the "emergency $500"

[2] Too-frequent deposits may attract unwanted attention. Luckily counter staff would remind customers before it happens.

AIA bigger plan (for wife) has SGD 30k for early-CI
If we stop paying premium, then AIA will deduct $28/M charges by redeeming from the investment portion.

SRS to pay for AIA premium? No

-- udpate or fuxi
Even with very low annual income, I should start HRBlock process as early as possible. Every week counts towards stress reduction and stress prevention.

-- fuxi:
I worry about my kids falling for the financial trap of debt; I worry about grandparents falling for scams.... but I'm not supersmart, super vigilant, immune to impulsive decision

To address those concerns, an asset can go under joint-signature custody. Example is the HDB flat.

CPF account is slighlty safer against scams.

compared to my SGD accounts, my USD accounts are slight less prone to impulsive actions.

Our insurance plans are less prone to quick liquidation
* AIA
* Prudential
* shield plans, ADL plans have miniml surrender values anyway
