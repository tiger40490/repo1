==== new: sms OTP via roaming
In general, I feel Starhub is more familiar, reliable than ChM. Actually ChM hotline is more accessible.

-- starhub
Roaming subscription required unconditionally. $10 for each re-subscription. You can resubscribe via wifi, but need to exit flight mode.

SGD 0.15 / message, but ..
Q: Will I get a flood of recent messages when I activate roaming?

Two ways to receive SMS for a short while. In both cases, need to disable data roaming using builtin interface, not via starhub app.
1) remove the SIM card immediately
2) exit flight mode, receive the OTP, then re-enter flight mode.
-- ChM
Roaming is enabled by default. No extra charge :)
Incoming SMS via roaming is ... free of charge by ChM

Why don't we try carrying the #159 SIM card to Sg and then find out how bad it is?
Acceptable plan: use #159 as my registered phoneNum for HSBC+ICBC. Cancel in a few months when we know how bad it is.

-- new: [23]class reunion: Y%%salary still relevant2frree
t_sharpQ
When I told YY and YYT that I can retire based on my savings + NNIA, there is an invisible elephant in the room. What they don't know is my salary now (and in the foreseeable future). 

Q: Mathematically, my current salary is an irrelevant term in the retirement equation, in which the income side consists solely of NNIA. So why is current salary relevant?

A: my current salary remains a huge factor affecting my motivation to continue working (working very hard vs semi-retired), rather than early retirement. This decision is very relevant to YY and YYT and many other ex-classmates until we turn 60.
A: If they come to know that my income is 5k vs 50k, then this data immediately anchors their perceptions/assumptions about my current burn rate. They would have some idea about my retirement equation amounts.
A: As I told each audience, my ffree is mathematically barebones, based on a conserver lifestyle. Therefore, each time I get a pay cheque, it strengthens my nest egg and elevates my ffree "high ground".

Attachment to salary? Impermanance? Indeed as we age, we would gradually lose income (similar to our libido, erection, flexibility,,,) so this is not something to cling on to. 
In contrast, I think it's more strategic to cling on to exployability, devTill70, family bonding, guaranteed NNIA.

Claim: you can and need to invest in stocks since young.
My take: Only U.S. stocks...

Observation: many countries' public pension-like system pays you only a fraction of you "current burn rate"

My Rule #1: be realisitc about retiring in style, and don't aim at current burn rate. Exclude housing and healthcare, aim at half the current burn rate.

My Rule #1b: from young age, take up the legwork to find long-term solutions for old age housing and healthcare.

-- update which bpost?
how many percent of Singaporeans have an exp recon system with 1-decimal precision i.e. 0.1k i.e. $100

This is a precise question. I would guess below 1%.

XianHua said a U.S. retiree in his case 
* receives $1400/M from SSA
* pays about $1500/M pTax if owning a home
* pays about $1000/M health insurance, much needed in old age

Sg offers a more affordable retirement, in terms of Melvin3.

With my increased Base salary (bonus is different story), how should we adjust our spending, savings etc?
* sugg: increase wealth accu for wife. cpfVcon is probably the most restrictive
* sugg: rebuild my cash reserve

More frequent usage of (and carrying) paper money increases risk of loss
but it gives me better feel for the outflow.
I think this risk is an inherent risk with paper money, to be accepted and managed.

sugg: pay offlines for all small amounts.
sugg: keep $50 notes in several places like office, cockpit1, cockpit4

It's hard to find property in SG below market value, but some sReits trade below NAV.
