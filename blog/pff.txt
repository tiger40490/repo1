-- new or update post on 5k/M historical record
current burn rate is probably around 5k (excluding transfers, cigna prem) if we include IRAS tax
When my burn rate was recorded at 5k (excluding transfers, mtg, MSFM) I had higher travel costs but lower piano costs

see also lifestyle improvements since 2020

"low-cost" is subjective. No debate please.

eg: 2-printer lifestyle, with plenty of paper + spare cartridge
eg: powerline networking .. relieving pain of wifi dead zone
eg: small laptop with git-blogg .. without it I couldn't work on my active ideas
eg: dhost.. relieving pains of the free wordpress.com site

-- fuxi or new: boring stock
To various commentators, a boring stock can fit any of these descriptions.

non-volatile .. lower beta, lower chance of quick profit or big loss. Good thing for many investors including perhaps R.Xia

less news coverage, less glamour, less to talk about with friends.

limited research coverage? Actually, many boring stocks are well-researched.

conventional wisdom of eq outperforming bonds in the long run only works in the U.S. market and only if you don't pay the expRatio to a eqMufu.

U.S. eq annualized return is about 6% in recent years, vs 3% for long bonds. With 2% exp ratio the gap is much much smaller.

-- update lifestyle creep
mixedVegRice used to be the best value in Singapore, either in coffee shops or food courts. No more.
I used to pick 2 veg or 1 veg 1 meat, for below $3.

Nowadays I eat out only once a month or so. I now pick 3 or 4 items for $4->5-6. I used to flinch at such price figures for mixedVegRice. Now I don't even notice my higher spend. 

The only explanation I have is higher disposable income and lifestyle creep.

Is if for nutrition? No. It's only for pleasure [variety]

Why hold on so tight even after relocation to U.S.?

H.Yi and AshS both mentioned something about trading time for money.
The proposed alternative is to make your money work harder to provide for family livelihood [3], so you don't need to. So you could spend your time on something else.

What's that something else? For me, it is some form of office work, rather than vacation.
Therefore, I willingly trade time for ... something to engage me.

[3] If we could _control_ exclub comparison, then livelihood burn rate can be taken care of already, so we don't need to work.

In the proposed alternative, you still need to spend time managing your portfolio!

-- babysitting still required. Very few nonwork incomes are truly passive and buy-n-forget, like CPF [SA and cpfLife]. 
REIT and div-stocks require babysitting when DYOC declines.

Rental properties (like mine in S.E.Asia) require some work with the local agents.

If the passive income stops being passive, then you are still trading time for money. That includes rental property management and day trading.

-- update ctbz?
t_creep
$2 wasted spend in Daiso .. is to be tolerated, given my nonwork incomes.
These spends won't accumulate beyond $1000/Y
ctbz in this case can be ineffective.

My due diligence (System 2) is sometimes too slow before spending such small amounts.  Let's record the small wasted spends so as to calibrate System 1.

small punch

-- buy-n-forget is not so easy with the bond mufu. The expRatio (?%) erodes the return. 
I may need to babysit my positions !

-- update income vs wealth 
(link from scorecard)
Some people are embarrassed to talk about (not necessarily personal) income, and prefer wealth instead.
Some people are embarrassed to talk about (not necessarily personal) wealth and prefer income instead.

These individuals may (subconsciously) prefer to steer the conversation.

Even safe bond funds on FSM involve much higher effort than my Robinhood process.

* problem: the amounts are too large, tyically 10k. Sugg: reduce to 1k
* risk/diligence: when I sell, I have to stay alert and ensure I don't sell the wrong lot i.e. from the wrong account
* the profit has to be recorded in my exp recon s/s
* I check the PnL for each position too often. 
* my tolerance is too low for large cash balance. sugg: accept 30k cash balance in cash account

It's crucial to be clear what exactly we want out of stock trading. Many valid priorities of other investors are not important to us. In fact, these OPPs (other people's priorities) may get in our way. 

* when you add those OPP, your life becomes more complicated, when it can be simpler like mine. You may have to babysit your positions. Your firewall is strained.
* when you add those OPP, your priority list would see some of your true priorities pushed down. Analog: carry-on luggage vs checked luggage.
* when you add those OPP, you may inadvertently take on more risks.

when stock picking is an active recreation, then novelty becomes a non-trivial selection criteria. That favors international exotic names, and new names. 

However, I have bought a lot of high-yield names. The remaining names tend to be low-yield. Hard to find any suitable stocks.

-- slow-cooking update livelihood blogs (S.Liu or Maslow)
[[Nomadland]] and many other movies and songs portray the livelihood pressures (even hardships) of ordinary people in relatively affluent locations (affluent as defined by global standard). For example, most Singaporeans would feel some livelihood pressure. 

For these individuals, my ezlife on the cash flow high ground is .. but a dream. 

I like mathematical criteria for that high ground, criteria like brbr, Fuller Wealth. By these criteria, my ezlife and my high ground are realistic for some of them, but they lack key incredients.

In my GEX course, I could see the livelihood pressure of many Singapore /nationals/ in their 40s, 50s and 60s
