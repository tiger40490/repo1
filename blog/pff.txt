--new or update: Y avoid branded colleges
If a branded top-quality middle school costs $20k/Y over 2Y, then many would be able to afford it, but could the brand give the parents esteem for decades?

A branded college does make the parents proud for decades, and makes the graduate stand out in over-crowded dating markets, but look at the price tag. If the 70k/Y price tag is clearly /affordable/ for you, then you won't need to aim for a "wise consumer". For most families, however, 300k over 4Y is too high, so these families need to assess the benefit/cost.

Those with insider info often realize the benefit is not so high.

Experience shows that our estimate of the downside is usually an underestimate. Therefore, some risk-averse investors dare not or refuse to trust the conventional wisdom about long-term strength of equity asset class. They would prefer cash or safe asset classes like soverign bonds.

They suspect that, in general, high-risk-high-return assets may turn out to be high-risk without a real alpha [i.e. significant likelihood of excess return].

I see long-term strength only in U.S. market. I consider all other markets highly unstable, but I am probably simplistic.

Q: Pick a random 10Y window some time into the near future (your lifetime). What is your estimated probability that SP500 (or another stock market) would show a positive return?  

The skeptics would probably say slighly above 50%. Some would say that a fairly priced SP500 could, in theory, shoot up 100 times (above fair value) over a year. Then it would be precarious and could collapse any time. However, such a scenario is unlikely because SP500 is hard to manipulate. The buyers would put themselves at grave risk by bidding up the price.

( In contrast, Beijing rEstate valuataion is probably 10 times above fair value, and could collapse any time. )

How about insurers? I think they invest some 10-20% in eq, the rest in bonds.

How about CPF (and pension funds)? For decades they have relied on eq to provide the required return. They (esp. CPF) haave been fairly reliable, despite many swan events.

Temasek's 400b is invested mostly in equities, with 62% allocation to Asia. Apparently, there is long-term strength in Asia equities, but I think this is misleading, because the retail investor would lack the resources of a gigantic fund, and unable to limit numerous losses that add up.

Some would predict an eq hedge fund could hit "positive returns for a few years, then give all up in one bad year". Well, we are one of the biggest hedge funds and we count some pension funds and insurers as investors. We are mostly equities but rather stable over the last 3 decades.

Now I feel Nsdq or any U.S. indices is susceptible to "fast_window" of 500% appreciation. That would precede a very long trough.

-- new or update: DCA assumes long-term strength of US stocks
This strength is evident only in US stocks, and not in Nsdq. 
Without this strength, your DCA would underperform "holding cash forever"

The "long term" should match your xjlCrunch. In many equity markets, the long-term strength can require 30Y of patience.

Nearest to a time of xjl crunch, MOETF could hit a crash.

I think this is one of top 3 reasons why most people hesitate about long-term commitment to the (risky) stock market.

.. Around age 30 (perhaps 25-35), most of us need liquidity for our xjl crunch, so we tend to sell equity when we want to cut losses. This cohort lack patience, stamina or holding power. When these investors see a large (realized or unrelized) equity loss, they tend to regret investing such a large amount in such a risky asset. Therefore, it's a challenge for this age group to buy-n-hold.

.. In our sunset years, we worry that we may not have the Sys2 resources to monitor MOETF. The start age of sunset years varies. Some may experience that difficulty when they start to withdraw from retirement account, so they experience a xjl crunch. They find it difficulty to liquidate stocks to support retirement expenses.
