It won't change after you pay part of the statement balance.

With the khm issues, I feel lucky to be diversified. I don't have a big big chunk stuck in one unit.

I also stopped overseas rEstate 

-- DJDJ.xlsx 21-Dec-2024 snapshot has a misleading format
-- fuxi: facing several mild stressors [aging parents, kids' academics, discipline,,,] I feel my pff efforts are partially helpful (glass half-full rather than half-empty).

* pff has proven a positive recreation, but not overseas rEstate .. too risky
* some assets do generate alpha that contribute to a sense of pff security
* in my old age, the above positive effect could become more important
* pff is a valuable conversation topic with kids and with friends.

Livelihood stressors do arise every year, and pff effort becomes more relevant.

Financial literacy is important for my family members.

A similar experience to share -- Mixed vegetable-rice (杂菜饭) is my default choice when I eat alone. In June 2024 I went to a low-cost street venue (without Aircon), and bought a regular 杂菜饭 -- two-veg-one-meat for $5.50. Used to cost $3.50 ~$4, perhaps 10 years ago. 

For a historical comparison I need to hold every variable constant:
* location .. food court (with Aircon) is my current default. Frequently, I do choose cheaper place like this June venue
* portion .. one-meat-one-veg-on-rice (一菜一肉) is my default. Frequently, I do get 1 or 2 additional items like this June case

$2 was my cost level some (20) years ago. Now the same food costs $3.50 minimum. When I see a price display of $6 for 杂菜饭, I get a sinking feeling (心里一沉) and immediately urge myself to cut down to two-veg-on-rice. Less often, I would tell myself I'm not really hungry and can wait until I reach office or home, where low-cost healthy foods await.

Q: how much would the same food cost (in the same place) in 2035? Probably below $7. My optimism.

My son may start working full time in 5 years, without a degree, and make $3k/M. $6 a meal translates to about $15/day. With that salary he has to cut down on food cost.

Even though food is an essential expense, food inflation is my least worry because ... many (reasonably healthy) choices exist. In contrast, I care more about medical, housing+utilities, public transport.

K.Hu suggested roaming retirement to Malaysia. Singapore is susceptible to imported inflation but not Malaysia.
Switzerland citizens don't have a next-door neighbor as a low-cost retirement destination. (Spain?) Sgp has JB.

Some x% annual inflation over some 15Y translate to perhaps 50% commulative inflation in Sgp. Malaysia cost level is much lower and will address that level of commulative inflation.

SGX blue chip stocks are an inflation hedge.

SP500 ETF is a classic inflation hedge.

I worry about my kids falling for the financial trap of debt; I worry about grandparents falling for scams.... but I'm not supersmart, super vigilant, immune to impulsive decision

To address those concerns, an asset can go under joint-signature custody. Example is the HDB property.

CPF account is slighlty safer against scams.

compared to my SGD accounts, my USD accounts are slight less prone to impulsive actions.

Our insurance plans are less prone to quick liquidation
* FWD, FLI2
* AIA
* Prudential
* shield plans, ADL plans have miniml surrender values anyway
