-- update which bpost?
I now feel China stocks are less familiar than U.S. stocks
* U.S. corporates answer to shareholders and try to create value for shareholders. (Same can be said of Singapore listed companies.) China's largest listed companies mostly answer to government. China companies seldom pay dividend. Out of the thousdans of China stocks, I'm sure some are well-managed, creating good shareholder values, but I don't know how to identify them.

* China A-shares are bought and sold mostly by retail investors. Retail investors are more irrational, leading to high volatility.

Q: when you read positive news about China stocks vs positive news about U.S. stocks, would you invest?

China news is state-controlled, esp. positive news. Even foreigne news agencies are "influenced". No such thing in the U.S., because news organizations are skeptical or critical about the Fed, White House or other government agencies.

In terms of earnings, China listed companies are more affected by government policy than their American peers. American large-caps are more global than China large-caps, so the former are less affected by U.S. government policies. 

Fundamentally, China remains a command economy, where the CCP has tight control over most listed companies. The 2021-2022 crackdown on tech companies was a recent example. I can't think of such a crackdown happening in the U.S.

Therefore, predicting policy change is key to investing in China stocks. Public news is tricky to follow.

With my increased Base salary (bonus is different story), how should we adjust our spending, savings etc?
* sugg: increase wealth accu for wife. cpfVcon is probably the most restrictive

-- update xxx or new: paper money in pff
More frequent usage of (and carrying) paper money increases risk of loss
but it can give me better feel for the outflow.
I think this is an inherent hazard with paper money, to be accepted and managed.

sugg: pay offlines for all small amounts.
sugg: keep $50 notes in several places like office, cockpit1, cockpit4
