-- update bpost on US taxes
Q: is it unlawful, unethical to put incorrect data on tax returns?
IRS is understaffed. Their fraud surveillance system is increasingly automated to reduce labor cost.

The ROI of the audit system has a numerator measured in (lost tax) dollars recovered. Therefore, if your tax income is a small sum, then I suspect they won't spend time analyzing it. 

Similarly, when I set out to free up my gmail storage, I won't spend time on small disk hogs.

By right, I contributed tax dollars during my 8Y stay, and won't receive any benefit in return. This is "The_system", unfair to H1B immigrants like me.

-- new: car cost after any burst of carefree-bubble
Car TOC often takes on a new dimension when on a cashflow low ground, or when your carefree-bubble bursts.
* when a family member is in long-term care
* when we are jobless
* when in bad weather .. emergency repairs costs more
* when we are physically challenged due to eyesight or disability. We might need taxi.

Much better if we live in a well-connected location with public transport.

Related to "merchandize return", another major tcost and stressor is keeping track of "stuff bought and disused long ago".

When I lose such an item (perhaps at home or discarded), and have to buy again, I feel an acute self-hate.

More frequent usage of (and carrying) paper money increases risk of loss
but it gives me better feel for the outflow.
I think this risk is an inherent risk with paper money, to be accepted and managed.

sugg: pay offlines for all small amounts.
sugg: keep $50 notes in several places like office, cockpit1, cockpit4

It's hard to find property in SG below market value, but some sReits trade below NAV.
