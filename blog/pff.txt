"Trust" as in trusting an investment salesperson, and trusting a company.

-- my RBBT experience .. I did my due diligence on the LIR calc
Trust in the bank system for calc algorithm.. is not a big concern, but bigger than EGA case/

The promised super-low LIR was too good to be trust-worthy.

-- my HY/PE experience .. 
With E12, I did my due diligence and decided to trust Chip Taylor.

With Jill, I invested multiple times. I still assume Jill might be trust-worthy but she (and her managers) had poor judgement on the companies that received the money.

-- My SEAsia rEstate decisions .. I visit the sites. I trust a salesperson after a long interaction. I transfer fund only to an account given by the same salesperson
-- my Rbh experience
Zero commission sounded too good to be trust-worthy, so I started small. 
-- my EGA experience .. I did my due diligence on the interest calc
The EGA-IR was too good to be trust-worthy.
Trust in the HSBC calc algorithm .. is not a big concern.

-- update wcpay/alipay bpost
Beware over-dependency on alipay/wcpay. They tend to be more complex and have more restrictions than POS or offline cash
Ask for POS and you may realize there are many POS terminals in Beijing's bigger merchants.

Another reason to prefer e-payment:
Some unscrupulous taxi drivers or vendors may quickly switch your genuine banknote for a fake one and then return the fake banknote to you and tell you the money you gave them is fake. They usually do this with 100 yuan notes since they are most valuable, although it may happen with 50 yuan notes too. Because of this, we suggest travelers in China keep some 10 or 50 yuan banknotes for small payments and avoid using 100 yuan notes when taking taxis or making small transactions.

-- update EGA
~~ plann4 end of EGA
Transfer most of the EGA balance to 6M TD or CIMB
convert to 15k mode of Premier, to support my Beijing account until Sep. 
Back in SG, I can terminate Premier and close China account remotely.
Once I have USD 25k in HSBC, place TD for a while, then try to take out in COrder, to avoid SGD 40 fee

-- update or new: enough nest egg2retire@current burn rate 
Claim: you can and need to invest in stocks since young.
My take: Only U.S. stocks...

Observation: many countries' public pension-like system pays you only a fraction of you "current burn rate"

My Rule #1: be realisitc about retiring in style, and don't aim at current burn rate. Exclude housing and healthcare, aim at half the current burn rate.

My Rule #1b: from young age, take up the legwork to find long-term solutions for old age housing and healthcare.

XianHua said a U.S. retiree in his case 
* receives $1400/M from SSA
* pays about $1500/M pTax if owning a home
* pays about $1000/M health insurance, much needed in old age

Sg offers a more affordable retirement, in terms of Melvin3.

-- fuxi
More frequent usage of (and carrying) paper money increases risk of loss
but it gives me better feel for the outflow.
I think this risk is an inherent risk with paper money, to be accepted and managed.

sugg: pay offlines for all small amounts.
sugg: keep $50 notes in several places like office, cockpit1, cockpit4
