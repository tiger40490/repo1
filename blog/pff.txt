-- update which bposts

Yes you can still treat RA as a savings acct. Suppose at 55 your SA balance is 512k when prevailing FRS is 500k. the FRS amount will transfer to RA, and the balance to OA. After that, by pledging your property, you can incrementally withdraw the (FRS-BRS) amount from RA. Meanwhile, you can also top up RA (see separate bpost)

cpf appt: 8.30am is better

-- new cpfRA top-up till startOfPayout
Every year, you can top up RA_bookVal to the prevailing ERS. All RA_accrued_interest goes to your RA, but excluded from RA_bookVal.

After startOfPayout (age 65 to 70), your interest accrual would start going into the pool. (RA emptied.)
