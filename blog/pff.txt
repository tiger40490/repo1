-- update bpost on IBs
There is a tough self-judge who dictates that I must do everything I can to "optimize U.S. stock trading". IBs-SGP account is non-optimal due to dividend withholding and other restrictions.

IBs-US account requires unexpired U.S. ID documents, but all of my U.S. ID documents are expired.
When I realize the likely infeasibility, somehow I had a sigh of relief.

I am *confident* I can accept the current situation, without feeling deprived, unlucky.
* No IBs for now
* stop liquidating from Rbh
* increase S27
* consider other Sgp-approved brokers only if I have bandwidth

Since 2010s I have had a consistent assessment that pff is the "best-performing" domain in terms of personal efficacy, accumulation,,,

Money is one thing I can pass to your kids. If I stay healthy, I can provide stewardship of a multi-gen reserve.

Luckily for me, there are other "legacies" in which I have confidence. I spent lots of time with my kids and influence them.

I see the huge effort by the government (among many national governments) to manage inflation and preserve purchasing power of the national currency.
Now I feel deflation or very low inflation is unnatural, unsustainable (in an inflationary global ecosystem) and potentially harmful to the local economy.

Money can be kept in a bank and preserved. Very few other things can.

-- slow cooking new: Jill's APD case
To the authorities or any impartial observer, this case is more like risky investment and legit business failure, rather than fraud "running away with my money". If I take that stance (painful) then I may have to accept it as business failure.

99% chance the authorities take it as civil not criminal case. I see a deadend there.

To pursue criminal case, I have to prove criminal intent.

As a civil case, the 2 options are both untenable -- pay lawyer fees or DIY.

ProBono lawyer's estimate -- s$7k lawyer fee, indicative of the complexity and legwork.

Lawyer advice: monitor newspaper and then contact the receiver
Lawyer advice: sue ADP within 6Y if you really want justice.

Chance of $recovery is perceived rather low becuase
* Limited liability. Company can declare business failure.

Q: is the Sg system unfair to the small investors on the street?
%%A: Sg government emphasized entrepreneurship risk taking. Small investors are free to take risks. When they suffer losses, they ought to be fully prepared with the necessary contingency plans such as DIY lawsuit or paying lawyer fees. Some small investors are unwilling/unable to follow those plans, so they need to accept the default plan -- no-op.

When Loh Junli suggested a police report, he didn't say it's easy. 
I assumed it would be a one-time job, an easy closure.
In reality, it has become an endless struggle. 
Once I lodge a police report, I wanted to ignore it but it made me feel guilty of abondoning my duty. 
In hind sight, the police report was reopening a wound. 
I had a decision to make when lodging the report -- reopening or leaving the would unopened.

-- update bpost on repurchase ^ div
Div is funded by profit. Repurchase can be funded by debt

Div can cause an immediate price drop. Repurchase has a long-term effect of boosting share price.

Repurchase cuts shares outstanding, and usually increase per-share measures of profitability like earnings-per-share (EPS),  and improve performance measures like ROE.

You're not required to sell your shares when a buyback is initiated. If you keep your stocks, your percentage of ownership in the issuing company will increase as other investors sell theirs.

grandparents have financial freedom due to healthcare and pension. This ffree is a big advantage esp. to the adult children, but it doesn't really make their lives a bliss.

-- new: paper money in cashflow mgmt
More frequent usage-of (and carrying) paper money increases risk of physical loss
but it can give me a better feel for the outflow rate.

I think this is an inherent contention about paper money, to be accepted and managed.

sugg: pay offlines for all small amounts.
