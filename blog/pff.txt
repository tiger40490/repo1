Experience shows that our estimate of the downside is usually an underestimate. Therefore, some risk-averse investors dare not or refuse to trust the conventional wisdom about long-term strength of equity asset class. They would prefer cash or safe asset classes like soverign bonds.

They suspect that, in general, high-risk-high-return assets may turn out to be high-risk without a real alpha [i.e. significant likelihood of excess return].

I see long-term strength only in U.S. market. I consider all other markets highly unstable, but I am probably simplistic.

Q: Pick a random 10Y window some time into the near future (your lifetime). What is your estimated probability that SP500 (or another stock market) would show a positive return?  

The skeptics would probably say slighly above 50%. Some would say that a fairly priced SP500 could, in theory, shoot up 100 times (above fair value) over a year. Then it would be precarious and could collapse any time. However, such a scenario is unlikely because SP500 is hard to manipulate. The buyers would put themselves at grave risk by bidding up the price.

( In contrast, Beijing rEstate valuataion is probably 10 times above fair value, and could collapse any time. )

How about insurers? I think they invest some 10-20% in eq, the rest in bonds.

How about CPF (and pension funds)? For decades they have relied on eq to provide the required return. They (esp. CPF) haave been fairly reliable, despite many swan events.

Temasek's 400b is invested mostly in equities, with 62% allocation to Asia. Apparently, there is long-term strength in Asia equities, but I think this is misleading, because the retail investor would lack the resources of a gigantic fund, and unable to limit numerous losses that add up.

Some would predict an eq hedge fund could hit "positive returns for a few years, then give all up in one bad year". Well, we are one of the biggest hedge funds and we count some pension funds and insurers as investors. We are mostly equities but rather stable over the last 3 decades.

Now I feel Nsdq or any U.S. indices is susceptible to "fast_window" of 500% appreciation. That would precede a very long trough.
