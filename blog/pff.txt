-- slow update sReit
I feel sReit is more transparent than usReit, largely due to the higher regulation.

The sReit operators are all well-known. Many of them are government-linked. As such, they are very low-risk in terms of govenance.

There are relatively few variations (a form of cognitive complexity) among the sReits.

"no right or wrong" but I do have an opinion. I think some of these individuals would regret when they re-evaluate their past decisions in total honesty
-- update 1 preclear a day
if I preclear a lot for a day, but later find myself in a power surge for math session or something else, then the pressure to do something about the pre-cleared stock is an unwanted distraction.

-- new or update one of the blogposts on ccbr
in my old age, I still want (not "need") a salary.

Working full time in my 70s for a competitive salary to support aging parents and kids' college .. sounds like very tough and unsustainable.

My NNIA is sufficient for cbbr, but not sufficient to support my aging parents. I think this type of "support" is a luxury comparable to branded degree for my kids. There is one difference -- my aging parents have their pension income and nest egg.

-- Hi Sok Ling,
I appreciate your time, your questions, your comments based on your experience with other companies' products and other customers. I like documenting my thoughts and reactions to such discussions -- these discussions have high "density", and I need chew them over.

) ECI (early critical illness) .. we spent a long time on this topic. Treatment costs are partially covered by shield plans + cpf medisave. What's not covered is rehab cost. My Prudential plan pays $27k till age 65. 

As I described in the pyramid, majority of diagnised ECI patients (pyramid base) are probably able to return to work within a year. Those who need to stop working for 5Y are a small minority IMO. The probability of hitting it before 65 is low. If you have real life stories, perhaps we can meet up again in Singpost Toa Payoh.

Insurance agents emphasize that when diagnosed with cancer, we don't want to work any more, but that's simply inconsistent with the reality I see. In fact, among the cancer patients I know, probably 100% of them choose to continue working while undergoing treatment. I said "choose to" not becuase I know they are rich, but because the treatment does not look massively disruptive, so it makes no sense to give up the job for that. In general I like working with colleagues, and plan to work till 70+. My work is not so stressful nowadays (compare to my early 40s) and will "improve" in my late 50s as I shift to less demanding jobs. So I doubt my job would interfere with my treatments for ECIs.

Nevertheless, getting an ECI is a harrowing experience emotionally, and a painful experience financially. To reduce the pains, I may consider a cancer insurance from FWD. I would appreciate if you can compare AXA product. No hurry. PrimeCare is a higher priority.

) hospitalization and surgery costs ... are much more likely than ADL events or ECI events. I think I have been hospitalized only once when not strictly necessary. My kids were hospitalized several times. Shield plans + PrimeCare are highly relevant to me.

) ADL .. i.e. long-term nurshing care insurance. I appreciate that you pointed out successful claim is not easy, presumably because ADL assessment is stringent. (Luckily my policies require just one or two ADL, not three.) My annual premiums add up to $6k+, much more than my other premiums. Not an accident, but due to gap analysis. We discussed various protections and gaps in between. I was already well covered on hospitalization, well-prepared on death/TPD, loss of income, but had no protection against long-term nursing care, until I noticed these ADL policies.

The ADL policies are more worthwhile than ECI plans, if we look at $10k/M lifetime payout. I aim to live 10-20Y with ADL conditions. 

Re PrimeCare,

I have probably never bought a NRB (non-reimbursement-based) medical insurance. I think one headache is the responsibility to remember what "benfits" there are available to me, in the middle of a medical event. If I don't remember, then I will fail to claim. (No such complexity with reimbursement-based.) So I think I need to keep a short summary of the benefits and periodically review them.

Another issue is, within a few years I am likely to relocate to the U.S. and will terminate PrimeCare. In the interim, I will have my company insurance that covers 100%, rather than the 95% coverage of integrated shield. So In a claim event, the NRB cash payout is additional income for me, but not so badly needed. 

-- fuxi: rate hike risks
I think it's prudent to reduce exposure to rate-sensitive sectors such as mReit. I don't like selling but I can reduce buying pace.
