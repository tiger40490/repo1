-- new: sustainable long-term return{annities
I have bought three annuities. Additionally, cpfLife is a "descending annuity"

Q: what's a sustainable (annualized) return before expensens?

Note this return rate is very different from (usually higher) the more visible payout_rate.

HsbcLWA seems to feature 8~9 ppa. I think it's unsustainable.

-- fuxi: despite all the challenges in khm, I still feel lucky about USD demomination + local marketing agency + locally known developer + CapitaLand endorsement

Also, compare to most developed country rEstate (including Sg), my quantum is very much manageable.
I don't have a big big chunk stuck in one unit.
I also stopped overseas rEstate
