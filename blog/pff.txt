-------- new: AUD100k deal
First, the concept of "TanBin_share_of_BJ_home" .. was 20% of the sale proceed at time of sale (mid 2024), amounting to Rmb1560k. I have since expatriated some 500k to Singapore, but TanBin_share_of_BJ_home by definition is unchanged.

Suppose in early 2025, grandma decides to lend Rmb500k to you. I will be the intermediary and liquidity provider. I will immediately disburse S$100k (whatever the equivalent of Rmb500k) to Australia from Singapore, and increase TanBin_share_of_BJ_home by Rmb500k.

TanBin_share_of_BJ_home increment is immediate and final as soon as I disburse S$100k (whatever the equivalent of Rmb500k), from my savings, funded by salary income.

-- Base scenario (Scenario 1): grandpa lives long enough.
By 2028 (or whatever) hopefully the entire amount of TanBin_share_of_BJ_home is in Singapore and belongs to me. You would owe grandma Rmb500k, to be repaid to her some day.

Throughout, essentially, I'm Not receiving any amount more (or less) than the original Rmb1560k. I'm only an intermediary.

-- Scenario 2: grandpa passing away early, soon after Rmb500k disbursement
After his passing 
* you could pay back Rmb500k to grandma. That's between you and her and none of my business.
* TanBin_share_of_BJ_home will remain at the elevated level above Rmb1560k (perhaps Rmb2060k). I will want to ensure I expatriate Rmb2060k in addition to 25% of grandpa's inheritance.

-- For both scenarios
I have no plan to take any compensation for the legwork of Rmb500k expatriation. If the legwork becomes too tiresome/troublesome, we will revisit. Give-n-take.

A similar experience to share -- Mixed vegetable-rice (杂菜饭) is my default choice when I eat alone. In June 2024 I went to a low-cost street venue (without Aircon), and bought a regular 杂菜饭 -- two-veg-one-meat for $5.50. Used to cost $3.50 ~$4, perhaps 10 years ago. 

For a historical comparison I need to hold every variable constant:
* location .. food court (with Aircon) is my current default. Frequently, I do choose cheaper place like this June venue
* portion .. one-meat-one-veg-on-rice (一菜一肉) is my default. Frequently, I do get 1 or 2 additional items like this June case

$2 was my cost level some (20) years ago. Now the same food costs $3.50 minimum. When I see a price display of $6 for 杂菜饭, I get a sinking feeling (心里一沉) and immediately urge myself to cut down to two-veg-on-rice. Less often, I would tell myself I'm not really hungry and can wait until I reach office or home, where low-cost healthy foods await.

Q: how much would the same food cost (in the same place) in 2035? Probably below $7. My optimism.

My son may start working full time in 5 years, without a degree, and make $3k/M. $6 a meal translates to about $15/day. With that salary he has to cut down on food cost.

Even though food is an essential expense, food inflation is my least worry because ... many (reasonably healthy) choices exist. In contrast, I care more about medical, housing+utilities, public transport.

-- update bpost on long-term SG inflation
K.Hu suggested roaming retirement to Malaysia. Singapore is susceptible to imported inflation but not Malaysia.
Switzerland citizens don't have a next-door neighbor as a low-cost retirement destination. (Spain?) Sgp has JB.

Some x% annual inflation over some 15Y translate to perhaps 50% commulative inflation in Sgp. Malaysia cost level is much lower and will address that level of commulative inflation.

SGX blue chip stocks are an inflation hedge. 

STI ETF? has expRatio, inferior to single names

SP500 ETF is a classic inflation hedge.

I worry about my kids falling for the financial trap of debt; I worry about grandparents falling for scams.... but I'm not supersmart, super vigilant, immune to impulsive decision

To address those concerns, an asset can go under joint-signature custody. Example is the HDB property.

CPF account is slighlty safer against scams.

compared to my SGD accounts, my USD accounts are slight less prone to impulsive actions.

Our insurance plans are less prone to quick liquidation
* FWD, FLI2
* AIA
* Prudential
* shield plans, ADL plans have miniml surrender values anyway
