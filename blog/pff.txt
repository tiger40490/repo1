-- new: [23]trio reunion: Y%%salary still relevant2frree
When I told YY and YYT that I can retire based on my savings + NNIA, what they don't know is my salary. 

Q: Mathematically, my current salary is an irrelevant term in the retirement equation, where the income side consists solely of NNIA. So why is current salary actually... crucial?

A: If they find out my income is 5k vs 50k, then this data immediately anchors their assumptions about my current burn rate. They would have some idea about my retirement equation amounts.
A: my current salary remains a huge factor affecting my motivation to continue working (very hard vs semi-retired), rather than early retirement. This decision is very relevant to YY and YYT and many other ex-classmates.
A: As I told each audience, my ffree is mathematically barebones, based on a conserver lifestyle. Therefore, each time I get a pay cheque, it strengthens my nest egg and improves my retirement "high ground".

Claim: you can and need to invest in stocks since young.
My take: Only U.S. stocks...

Observation: many countries' public pension-like system pays you only a fraction of you "current burn rate"

My Rule #1: be realisitc about retiring in style, and don't aim at current burn rate. Exclude housing and healthcare, aim at half the current burn rate.

My Rule #1b: from young age, take up the legwork to find long-term solutions for old age housing and healthcare.

how many percent of Singaporeans have an exp recon system with 1-decimal precision i.e. 0.1k i.e. $100

This is a precise question. I would guess below 1%.

XianHua said a U.S. retiree in his case 
* receives $1400/M from SSA
* pays about $1500/M pTax if owning a home
* pays about $1000/M health insurance, much needed in old age

Sg offers a more affordable retirement, in terms of Melvin3.

With my increased Base salary (bonus is different story), how should we adjust our spending, savings etc?
* sugg: increase wealth accu for wife. cpfVcon is probably the most restrictive
* sugg: rebuild my cash reserve

More frequent usage of (and carrying) paper money increases risk of loss
but it gives me better feel for the outflow.
I think this risk is an inherent risk with paper money, to be accepted and managed.

sugg: pay offlines for all small amounts.
sugg: keep $50 notes in several places like office, cockpit1, cockpit4

It's hard to find property in SG below market value, but some sReits trade below NAV.
