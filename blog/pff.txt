-- new: %%SP500 position: greed^fear
Perhaps accumulate at a slower pace rather than cash out. This is the DCA philosophy. DCA is esp. proven in SP500.

My s27 position is good. Average cost probably around $500. If I liquidate all, I make a handsome profit. Then I could start from a clean slate.
SellAll can cause regret if sp500 keeps climbing and my SRS 60k idle cash earns a paltry SSB DIR

If I hold and then suffer paper loss together with everyone else (DCA..), I would feel "safe" in the bandwagon, protected from blame.

Now is fear time for many. Buffett said something like "Be greedy when market is fearful." but he is reducing his positions.

-- update bpost: cpfSA will disappear after 55, so you can't treat it as a 4 ppa flexible savings

practice log-in once a month. Slightly easier to recover lost password than ICBC

After you reinstall mobank, you  need to enter your existing passwd twice, then recreate mobilePIN. 

global transfer may have a USD 50k/Y limit
deposit USD .. 50k/Y limit, spaced out[2]
There's no FOC way to get more USD into hsbc.cn. USD transfer from another bank is unlikely to be FOC. I am not allowed to buy USD as a foreigner, except the "emergency $500"

[2] Too-frequent deposits may attract unwanted attention. Luckily counter staff would remind customers before it happens.

If we stop paying premium, then AIA will deduct $28/M charges by redeeming from the investment portion.

SRS to pay for AIA premium? No

Some investment salesmen or authors pose the question "Do you think you are an effective investor?" Some friends also pose that question.

The investment management industry has an industry standard about picking a "benchmark" for each managed product, because the benchmark is a crucial factor (in performance evaluation etc). Most investment managers choose some index. They think their index is fair. I guess so. 

I don't bother to find a fair benchmark for my portfolio. It's too complicated and touches a raw nerve.

Those salesmen tend to suggest an implicit benchmark on my performancce, but is it fair? I feel those implicit benchmarks tend to be very high and therefore unfair.

I feel a retail investor is considered fairly /successful/ ("doing fine") if his long-term return beats DIR [deposit IR] with a reasonable volatility.

Even with very low annual income, I should start HRBlock process as early as possible. Every week counts towards stress reduction and stress prevention.

-- update https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/43456/y-per-financetop-strength/
Since 2010s I have had a consistent assessment that pff is my strongest hand, strongest tectonic plate, and my "best-performing" game, in terms of personal efficacy, battery, accumulation,,,

Money can be kept in a bank and preserved, like batteries. (Few other things can.) Inflation is the enemy.
Money is one thing I can pass to my kids. If I stay healthy, I can provide stewardship of a multi-gen reserve.

Luckily for me, there are non-financial "legacies" in which I have confidence. I spent lots of time with my kids and influence them.

Q: r-ikigai?

-- fuxi: the will-preparation process has a focusing effect. We are nudged to focus on various worst-case scenarios of early death. Within this tunnel vision, long-term investments appear to be too risky and unsuitable. We are nudged to favor very short-term investment strategies. It's risk-averse to the extreme.

Even if we transition to such a portfolio, there's no guarantee that my offspring would actually fare better. There could be currency devaluation, high inflation, irresponsible spending ...

-- fuxi: insurance companies: need to give nomination

-- fuxi: SP500 continues to beat most investment products out there. So I may need to increase my position in SP500 (or a simliar index ETF)
Beside S27 and the DJ product, are there other US ETFs listed on SGX?

If you want to maximize cpfLife, then
1) top up cpfRA to the max (4x BRS) at 55
2) don't withdraw. Let it grow at 4%. Your max cpfRA balance will grow faster than the ERS_index grows.

-- fuxi: How do I feel about terminating the Citi SMRT card? 
Freedom from worry about annual fee
Freedom from anxiety over large credit limit

-- fuxi or update (which) bpost on inflation
I see the huge effort by PAP government to manage inflation and preserve purchasing power of the national currency.
Now I feel very low inflation is unnatural, unsustainable (in an inflationary global ecosystem) and potentially harmful to the local economy.
