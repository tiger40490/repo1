-- update bpost on low-latency?
I envy the LkP early investor who made perhaps a million paper profit, but hey, he also envies me for
* my high annual salary. Total salary would exceed his paper profit in a few years. Over a few more years, my total would far exceed his paper profit.
* my wellness + family harmony

He would also envy the bigger investors who made $3M .. low-latency arms race! What's enough? Pehraps half a million

Now am inundated, I realized the maintenance effort of investment assets:
* truly passive income is rare. Cambodia is much closer to ideal than BGC is. 
* Local agent does add some value... Am willing to pay a decent fee
* recreational MOETF is good in terms of zero obligation (to invest more)
* babysitt on existing positions would be unsustainable
