-- new: APD case
To the authorities or any impartial observer, this case is more like risky investment and legit business failure, rather than fraud "running away with my money". If I take that stance (painful) then I may have to accept it as business failure.

99% chance the authorities take it as civil not criminal case. I see a deadend there.

To pursue criminal case, I have to prove criminal intent.

As a civil case, the 2 options are both untenable -- pay lawyer fees or DIY.

ProBono lawyer's estimate -- s$7k lawyer fee, indicative of the complexity and legwork.

Lawyer advice: monitor newspaper and then contact the receiver
Lawyer advice: sue ADP within 6Y if you really want justice.

Chance of $recovery is perceived rather low becuase
* Limited liability. Company can declare business failure.

Q: is the Sg system unfair to the small investors on the street?
%%A: Sg government emphasized entrepreneurship risk taking. Small investors are free to take risks. When they suffer losses, they ought to be fully prepared with the necessary contingency plans such as DIY lawsuit or paying lawyer fees. Some small investors are unwilling/unable to follow those plans, so they need to accept the default plan -- no-op.

An easy mistake is to count the recent lunch bills . With 3 to 9 recent experiences of the last year, you get a very "confident" and concrete estimate of the "typical" cost as of this year. 

However, you would very easily forget to hold some important factors constant such as the venue and number of dishes. 

Need to use the same coffee shop food, or the same food court food, or the same Chinatown food.

-- update bpost on repurchase ^ div
Div is funded by profit. Repurchase can be funded by debt

Div can cause an immediate price drop. Repurchase has a long-term effect of boosting share price.

Repurchase cuts shares outstanding, and usually increase per-share measures of profitability like earnings-per-share (EPS),  and improve performance measures like ROE.

You're not required to sell your shares when a buyback is initiated. If you keep your stocks, your percentage of ownership in the issuing company will increase as other investors sell theirs.

More frequent usage-of (and carrying) paper money increases risk of physical loss
but it can give me a better feel for the outflow rate.

I think this is an inherent contention about paper money, to be accepted and managed.
