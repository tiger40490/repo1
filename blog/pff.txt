I repeated my rental yield reservations. 

Susan said HDB flat is not exactly like a rental property investment, but also a family residence.

wife has concern about "hard to sell" in 20Y. Similarly, Susan said decades ago, HDB price level was considered very high and many ordinary Singaporeans were worried about buying at the peak, but I guess they had no choice. 

This "inflation" makes rental yield decline basically inevitable whenever we upgrade/downgrade.

What units face risk of price drop? Wife said older flats. I say on-the-run. The better question is "will the price gap widen or narrow down, over our holding window?"

It's crucial to be clear what exactly we want out of stock trading. Many valid priorities of other investors are not important to us. In fact, these OPPs (other people's priorities) may get in our way. 

* when you add those OPP, your life becomes more complicated, when it can be simpler like mine. You may have to babysit your positions. Your firewall is strained.
* when you add those OPP, your priority list would see some of your true priorities pushed down. Analog: carry-on luggage vs checked luggage.
* when you add those OPP, you may inadvertently take on more risks.

primary goal of exp recon is .. expense analysis
A minor goal is liquid NAV tracking. This goal doesn't require complicated system. Accuracy and reliability is extremely valuable. The expense recon provides exactly that quality assurance.

-- update lifestyle creep
mixedVegRice used to be the best value in Singapore, either in coffee shops or food courts. No more.
I used to pick 2 veg or 1 veg 1 meat, for below $3.

Nowadays I eat out only once a month or so. I now pick 3 or 4 items for $4->5-6. I used to flinch at such price figures for mixedVegRice. Now I don't even notice my higher spend. 

The only explanation I have is higher disposable income and lifestyle creep.

Is if for nutrition? No. It's only for pleasure [variety]

buy-n-forget is not so easy with the bond mufu. The expRatio (?%) erodes the return. 
I may need to babysit my positions !

-- slow-cooking update livelihood blogs (S.Liu or Maslow)
[[Nomadland]] and many other movies and songs portray the livelihood pressures (even hardships) of ordinary people in relatively affluent locations (affluent as defined by global standard). For example, most Singaporeans would feel some livelihood pressure. 

For these individuals, my ezlife on the cash flow high ground is .. but a dream. 

I like mathematical criteria for that high ground, criteria like brbr, Fuller Wealth. By these criteria, my ezlife and my high ground are realistic for some of them, but they lack key incredients.

In my GEX course, I could see the livelihood pressure of many Singapore /nationals/ in their 40s, 50s and 60s
