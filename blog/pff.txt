cpf appt: 8.30am is better

-- fuxi: despite all the challenges in khm, I still feel lucky about USD demomination + local marketing agency + locally known developer + CapitaLand endorsement

I don't have a big big chunk stuck in one unit.
I also stopped overseas rEstate

Maximum amount you can top up (to spouse) using CPF - $43,946.14 ???
