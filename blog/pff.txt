Don't blame wife for such small mistakes, like a demanding boss. She is only human.
Laugh it off. 

-- udpate channel520
~~ retrospective of my high-cost Channel520 experience on 6 Mar

For a USD "5k Progress", the difference between 7.49 and 7.29 is ... Rmb 1000. I made two independent purchase decisions. Let's focus on Decision#1.

J4: after grandpa passed, I felt an urge to speed up progress on project 1560k, before inheritance "battle" starts. To lighten this growing /burden/, I was willing to incur higher transaction costs than before. 
On the other hand, I witnessed non-trivial cash growth in recent annual snaps, annuity payouts, bonuses,,, Semi-consciously, I was willing to deploy this "resource" for personal stress reduction.

J4: I felt and still feel USD 5k is a big Progress among the past progresses, such as ChannelX with Jason, or KaiPeng's friend .. I was willing to meet up among the 3 of us, for long hours, just to exchange Sgd 10k.

J4: I recalled that I used to accept 7.49 when 7.49 was official bank rate. In hindsight, I feel this is a less rational argument. It was also irrational to use bank rate as benchmark.

The FX spread over bank rate in this case represented the most expensive ex_China transaction ever/

J4: I felt Rmb500 (for USD 5k, 7.39 vs 7.49) was a small extra cost compared to our other RMB costs in Beijing including hotel. In hindsight, I think this argument is flawed and goes against ctbz optimization. 
If I were able to get a friend to withdraw USD 5k under his ID and exchange with me, I am willing to pay him Rmb 500.

As it turned out, 7.49 vs 7.26 for USD 5k translated to Rmb 1150. Is this an acceptable cost for the Progress? Yes

J4: June.Zhang has two secret weapons 1) borrow someone's IC 2) repeat after ChinaCustom.

J4: Even after the USD 42k success with ChannelM, I still want grandma to avoid ChannelM. This Xiamen experience is traceless for my family and presents zero SAFE risk.

I was decisive in grabbing a rare opportunity to lighten my "burden" with a swift Progress, without SAFE implications, and minimal legwork (only RMB ATM)

-- update channel520
rmb 30k was once caught according to one eye witness but among those carrying 30k, what probability is that? I feel below 1%

Penalty... I choose (my bias) to consider it mild. For USD, June.Zhang said customer can get return the exceess USD to her company.

-- update cmb
non-smrz mobileNum.. Rmb 5k/day 
Better use the temp SIM option

-- update channelM

my latest SG address .. I put in my office addr. Need not match my address registered at icbc.SG
swift code ICBKSGSGXXX, address of icbc.sg

wireTT from icbc.cn .. 0.05% charge by sender bank, capped at Rmb260. No other fee charged :(

~~ icbc::gp Rmb FixD transfer to savings: 
Must come to branch. Bring my passport + his
IC
bank card
paper certificate
no auth letter needed

-- update "lock up100k]cpf"
college funding is not a one-time big-ticket, more like quarterly big payment
-- update bpost on PFL .. is a monthly rent to let me own and grow the cashcow . When the cashcow starts producing milk it stops growing

-- new: sustainable long-term return{annities
I have bought three annuities. Additionally, cpfLife is a "descending annuity"

Q: what's a sustainable (annualized) return before expensens?

Note this return rate is very different from (usually higher) the more visible payout_rate.

HsbcLWA seems to feature 8~9 ppa. I think it's unsustainable.

-- new: Channel1k [USD1k/D for foreigners]
The Xiamen lady June.Zhang told me it's ok to exchange for USD 1k/D at her money changer (higher cost than at banks)

HSBC banker told me this "emergency privilege" for foreigners is to be used sparingly.

Q: is it illegal to exchange for USD 1k every day?
A: clearly legal and not prohibited

Q: what if I get on the SAFE watch list
J.Z: SAFE approval is required during the cash exchange. If SAFE real time system identifies the customer's ID (passport or IC) as a watched ID, then the guy will be turned away. There should be no criminal charge for 1k/D alone without some suspicious activities

Q: what if I get on the radar but not the watch list? No answer.
J.Z: her money changer firm is authorized to sell USD to such a foreigner. China citizens are monitored more than foreigners.

-- fuxi: despite all the challenges in khm, I still feel lucky about USD demomination + local marketing agency + locally known developer + CapitaLand endorsement

Also, compare to most developed country rEstate (including Sg), my quantum is very much manageable.
I don't have a big big chunk stuck in one unit.
Travel cost is very affordable
I also stopped overseas rEstate
