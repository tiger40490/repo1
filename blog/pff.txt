-- new: what if USD weakens
J4 this bpost: I have a sizeable USD cash pile. Given the high chance of USD/SGD decline, do I need to "do something" within 2025?

Q: for USD/SGD, is 10% devaluation (to 1.20) a matter of time and soemthing certaub to happen within 5Y?
%%A: no 

Some SCB Mar 2025 article pointed out that "about 40% of the underlying revenue exposure of the SP500 index companies is sourced from outside the US. This creates a natural hedge."

USD/SGD decline will not be a crash like in equities. Will take more than a year. I will wait then convert my FixD to SGD.

Q: When USD weakens by 1%, how do you know if it is a normal fluctuaion or part of multi-year decline?
%%A: I guess the macro news may explain it.

Given my growing cash pile, what are the real cashflow risks?

* scam
* investment failures.. I hit a few up to the JillLim case.
* job loss. Over the decades, I'm well-prepared mentally and financially
* salary drop (without job loss).. My conviction: unlikely.
* USD or RMB devaluation.. My conviction: I think SGD will NOT grow so strong
* prolonged excessive inflation .. I have seen only once in my lifetime, 2023-2024 but not prolonged.
