--new: best use of ETF against due-diligence
Keep small positions in a number of specific ETFs.
If specific sector is down but I have no specific stock pre-cleared and checked out, then just buy sector-specific ETFs.
After I use single stocks to gain exposure, reduce those ETFs to free up cash.

Reduce (or exit) the broad ETFs.

in the late 2000s, my mom said CNY 400k was a good-enough medical reserve for each retiree, on top of health insurance (reimbursement-based). Such insurance has coinsurance, and many exclusions including elective treatments [imported medication, supplements,,]. 

My dad recalled the consensus figure among retirees of the time -- regardless of the medical condition, if CNY 500k is spent over and on top of insurance and still the life can't be saved, then it's reasonable to give up. As such CNY 500k was a reasonable personal medical reserve.

Fast forward to 2022, CNY 500k-1000k of family savings is common according to my dad living in Beijing. I think this improvement in savings reflects (medical++) inflation, rising income, rising wealth esp. in rEstate.

With zero-div stocks and commission costs, entry-price/timing decision is more risky, more error-prone, more intimidating, less fun. 
I often become paralyzed by the due diligence.

The dividend payout is a huge psychological and economic cushion against NAV drop or regretable entry-price.

Similarly, rEstate investment without rental yield is more risky.

buy-n-forget is not so easy with the bond mufu. The expRatio (0.5%?) erodes the low return. 
I may need to babysit my positions !

When I read books on REITs, I remember the AMB effort.. the differences in terms of reluctance.

I recall that when I was told stock picking requires reading financial statements, I balked. Then in 2020 I learned my 3-min due diligence. 

It turned out that zero commission and fractional investing removed the bulk of the burden/reluctance/drudgery of due diligence.

-- new: y your parents buy expensive gears 4 your new hobby

I always laugh at the middle-class Singapore parents who buy high-end equipment whenever their kids start learning a new skill
* musical instruments
* art equipment
* sports gears
* multimedia gadgets

Now I ask myself Q: what's the priority of a middle-class parent? 
I guess answer is motivation, commitment. Some of these parents are not mindless -- they are mindful of the psychological effect on the child.

I  hope to control tCost and cCost
This trend is more like creep than splurge

My long stay in Bayonne reassured myself that Bayonne is an acceptable location, esp. if I work in JC.
With a growing reserve, I can opt for a lower-paying job in JC, but there could be very good jobs in NYC.

Best choice for family is still living in JC and commuting to JC or NYC. 

Renting in JC is the default choice. flexibility

How did I get Tilray stock for free?
Probably a conversion due to M&A.
I assume it is a data error

After 55, we should leave cpf oa balance as is. It grows at 2.5%pa, better than bank deposits in return and liquidity.

any time after 55, I can incrementally withdraw most of my cpfOA to invest or spend.

It's crucial to be clear what exactly we want out of stock trading. Many valid priorities of other investors are not important to us. In fact, these OPPs (other people's priorities) may get in our way. 

* when you add those OPP, your life becomes more complicated, when it can be simpler like mine. You may have to babysit your positions. Your firewall is strained.
* when you add those OPP, they could displace some of your true priorities. Analog: carry-on luggage vs checked luggage.
* when you add those OPP, you may inadvertently take on more risks.

Matching SP500 return ... is a bad OPP
Investing 80% of my assets, and minimizing idle cash (make every dollar work hard) ... is an OPP

SG and China rEstate can't keep rising at the last-10Y pace.
However, U.S. stocks can keep rising at the last-10Y pace. There's enough hot money to support the growth stocks. As to value stocks, U.S. dividend stocks consistently generate CDY that's superior to non-US stocks.

-- fuxi or new: most upgrading home buyers would max out their borrowing capacity
Delphia of oc is a mortgage specialist. She said majority of Singapore borrowers (probably including foreigners) would max out their loan quantum. One of the most important limits is TDSR. No more than 55% (was 60) of income (including CPF) is allowed to be used for installment. 55% of total income spent on debt servicing .. sounds like low ground. 

I asked her why "majority" has such a motivation. Delphia said many want to maximize their investment. (Delphia herself felt buying at the current price level doesn't sound like good investment.) It's leveraged investment at a very low borrowing cost.

Now I recall Wallace Xu said something similar about American home buyers... they are highly sensitive to rate hike.

-- slow-cooking update livelihood blogs (S.Liu or Maslow)
[[Nomadland]] and many other movies and songs portray the livelihood pressures (even hardships) of ordinary people in relatively affluent locations (affluent as defined by global standard). For example, most Singaporeans would feel some livelihood pressure. 

For these individuals, my ezlife on the cash flow high ground is .. but a dream. 

I like mathematical criteria for that high ground, criteria like brbr, Fuller Wealth. By these criteria, my ezlife and my high ground are realistic for some of them, but they lack key incredients.

In my GEX course, I could see the livelihood pressure of many Singapore /nationals/ in their 40s, 50s and 60s
