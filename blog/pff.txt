-- update SBH
As XA.S hinted, the 750k is not buying a huge improvement.
I feel dissatisfied if the improvement is too small. In this case it's mostly higher floor + better renovation... big improvements for wife. She sacrificed a lot for the family and deserves a more comfortable home.

I feel dissatisfied if ROTI is too low. Roti in terms of rental yield or appreciation. In this case, Roti is low but not as low as a bigger upgrade.

So we are striking a balance.

Since late 2019, we have enjoyed a cashflow high ground. 

If I spend too much on this SBH, I give up a lot of high ground. In this case the loss is tolerable. Am reluctant, not resentful.

If I spend "too little" money, I am fine as as a minimalist, but not her. I have a growing pile of spare cash, not buying enough quality of life for wife.

It's crucial to be clear what exactly we want out of stock trading. Many valid priorities of other investors are not important to us. In fact, these OPPs (other people's priorities) may get in our way. 

* when you add those OPP, your life becomes more complicated, when it can be simpler like mine. You may have to babysit your positions. Your firewall is strained.
* when you add those OPP, they could displace some of your true priorities. Analog: carry-on luggage vs checked luggage.
* when you add those OPP, you may inadvertently take on more risks.

Matching SP500 return ... is a bad OPP
Investing 80% of my assets, and minimizing idle cash (make every dollar work hard) ... is an OPP

primary goal of exp recon is .. expense analysis
A minor goal is liquid NAV tracking. This goal doesn't require complicated system. Accuracy and reliability is extremely valuable. The expense recon provides exactly that quality assurance.

-- fuxi or new: most upgrading home buyers would max out their borrowing capacity
Delphia of oc is a mortgage specialist. She said majority of Singapore borrowers (probably including foreigners) would max out their loan quantum. One of the most important limits is TDSR. No more than 55% (was 60) of income (including CPF) is allowed to be used for installment. 55% of total income spent on debt servicing .. sounds like low ground. 

I asked her why "majority" has such a motivation. Delphia said many want to maximize their investment. (Delphia herself felt buying at the current price level doesn't sound like good investment.) It's leveraged investment at a very low borrowing cost.

Now I recall Wallace Xu said something similar about American home buyers... they are highly sensitive to rate hike.

buy-n-forget is not so easy with the bond mufu. The expRatio (0.5%?) erodes the low return. 
I may need to babysit my positions !

-- slow-cooking update livelihood blogs (S.Liu or Maslow)
[[Nomadland]] and many other movies and songs portray the livelihood pressures (even hardships) of ordinary people in relatively affluent locations (affluent as defined by global standard). For example, most Singaporeans would feel some livelihood pressure. 

For these individuals, my ezlife on the cash flow high ground is .. but a dream. 

I like mathematical criteria for that high ground, criteria like brbr, Fuller Wealth. By these criteria, my ezlife and my high ground are realistic for some of them, but they lack key incredients.

In my GEX course, I could see the livelihood pressure of many Singapore /nationals/ in their 40s, 50s and 60s

What units face risk of price drop? Wife said older flats. I say on-the-run. The better question is "will the price gap widen or narrow, over our holding window?"
