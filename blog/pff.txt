Q: any accrued int if I liquidate long after payout month (March). 
AA: You would lose accrued int. Better liquidate in March.

I will come in Sat morning.

I always resist the "limited time offer" pressure when evaluating a long-term investment. I appreciate your reassurance that if 12M TD rate drops by 15 bps, I would only forgo $225 of interest. Well, $225 is big enough to motivate me take a few quick steps. That's why I quickly set up multiple discussions. These discussions help me firm up my mind and reduce "unknown risks".

Main risk we discussed (and my main concern) is the prison-term or the lock-up period. On that front, you asked me many times ... do I have productive use of my idle cash. Unlikely other people of my age, I don't care about that question. I need liquidity. I need most of my money in liquid accounts, available at short notice (like 6M tBills), even if "unproductive".

I have a high tolerance for low yield, and low tolerance for lock-up period. This is not exactly rational, wise, or smart, but it is a preference shaped by personal experiences. Personal experiences are a more powerful influence than theoretical analysis or peer comparison. I don't envy those who earn 4% XIRR.

How did I deploy idle cash? CpfSA top-up is one past experience of how I deploy idle cash. In another case, I placed 100k+ in bond mutual funds. I vague recall yet another experience -- when I placed most of my idle dollars in time deposits. 

My wife is also the same type. I think she doesn't mind leaving 100k in her savings account.

Wayne pointed out many times that in Mar 2026, I have the option to liquidate FLI2, and I can also keep it till Mar 2027. That's a viable option if prevailing interest is below 3%.

-- update bpost: cpfSA will disappear after 55, so you can't treat it as a 4 ppa flexible savings 
Need major rethink.

Taiping has such products (rare among local insurers)
:( longer prison term than SGD products
:) higher payout (close to 4%) than SGD products

-- update bpost: inheritance ex-China
Rule: After first parent passes away, his/her cash assets would be distributed according to will
Observation: It takes less than "several months" to get his cash distributed to 3 survivors

Rule: Using authenticated proof, I (and sister) can engage 国家外汇监管 to get my portion released. Few bankers know how to do it, but Bryan Du said HSBC has experience with inheritance by passport-holders.

As to inheritance tax, Bryan said usually none in his experience (tiny sample), but regulation may change, so he cautioned me to check with an accountant.

Observation: Inheritance law has been proposed many times but still not implemented. It may take years.

-- update bpost on ex-China
My biggest worry is inheritance tax but there is no sign of it coming.
My next biggest worry is slow release after one of them goes, so I try to speed up ex-China.

I had a boot camp on Chinese SAFE restrictions. Now I feel confident that I know the basics.

PRC gov policy may relax or tighten (close loopholes) capital control any time, but inheritance law is more stable.

practice log-in once a month. Slightly easier to recover lost password than ICBC

After you reinstall mobank, you  need to enter your existing passwd twice, then recreate mobilePIN. 

global transfer may have a USD 50k/Y limit
deposit USD .. 50k/Y limit, spaced out[2]
There's no FOC way to get more USD into hsbc.cn. USD transfer from another bank is unlikely to be FOC. I am not allowed to buy USD as a foreigner, except the "emergency $500"

[2] Too-frequent deposits may attract unwanted attention (not as complicated as SAFE surveillance). Luckily counter staff would remind customers before it ("attracting") happens.

If we stop paying premium, then AIA will deduct $28/M charges by redeeming from the investment portion.

SRS to pay for AIA premium? No

Some investment salesmen or authors pose the question "Do you think you are an effective investor?" Some friends also pose that question.

The investment management industry has an industry standard about picking a "benchmark" for each managed product, because the benchmark is a crucial factor (in performance evaluation etc). Most investment managers choose some index. They think their index is fair. I guess so. 

I don't bother to find a fair benchmark for my portfolio. It's too complicated and touches a raw nerve.

Those salesmen tend to suggest an implicit benchmark on my performancce, but is it fair? I feel those implicit benchmarks tend to be very high and therefore unfair.

I feel a retail investor is considered fairly /successful/ ("doing fine") if his long-term return beats DIR [deposit IR] with a reasonable volatility.

Even with very low annual income, I should start HRBlock process as early as possible. Every week counts towards stress reduction and stress prevention.

Since 2010s I have had a consistent assessment that pff is my strongest hand, strongest tectonic plate, and my "best-performing" game, in terms of personal efficacy, battery, accumulation,,,

Money can be kept in a bank and preserved, like batteries. (Few other things can.) Inflation is the enemy.
Money is one thing I can pass to my kids. If I stay healthy, I can provide stewardship of a multi-gen reserve.

Luckily for me, there are non-financial "legacies" in which I have confidence. I spent lots of time with my kids and influence them.

Q: r-ikigai?

-- fuxi: the will-preparation process has a focusing effect. We are nudged to focus on various worst-case scenarios of early death. Within this tunnel vision, long-term investments appear to be too risky and unsuitable. We are nudged to favor very short-term investment strategies. It's risk-averse to the extreme.

Even if we transition to such a portfolio, there's no guarantee that my offspring would actually fare better. There could be currency devaluation, high inflation, irresponsible spending ...

Beside S27 and the DJ product, are there other US ETFs listed on SGX?

If you want to maximize cpfLife, then
1) top up cpfRA to the max (4x BRS) at 55
2) don't withdraw. Let it grow at 4%. Your max cpfRA balance will grow faster than the ERS_index grows.

-- fuxi: How do I feel about terminating the Citi SMRT card? 
Freedom from worry about annual fee
Freedom from anxiety over large credit limit

-- fuxi or update (which) bpost on inflation
I see the huge effort by PAP government to manage inflation and preserve purchasing power of the national currency.
Now I feel very low inflation is unnatural, unsustainable (in an inflationary global ecosystem) and potentially harmful to the local economy.
