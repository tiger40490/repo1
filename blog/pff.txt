-- New: market timing: K.Hu and Wood
As I said, I am not keen about hot growth stocks, including tech stocks. Out of 200+ stocks I own, about 1% of them are hot growth stocks where I invested more than $100 each.

When I do invest, I am like Cathie Wood, not like K.Hu.

I plan on holding for 3Y+, and I don't babysit those stocks after I buy.
