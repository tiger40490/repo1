I worry about my kids falling for the financial trap of debt; I worry about grandparents falling for scams.... but I'm not supersmart, super vigilant, immune to impulsive decision

An asset can go under joint-signature custody. Example is the HDB flat.

CPF account is slighlty safer against scams.

compared to my SGD accounts, my USD accounts are slight less prone to impulsive actions.

Our insurance plans are less prone to quick liquidation

-- new: DJIA ETFs
Many criticize the price-weighted index as overweight on high-price names like UnitedHealth

Many view DJIA as too volatile, not diversified enough. I don't share this view.

DJIA 30 stocks are strong, well-run companies, possibly stronger than the average SP500 companies. I tend to feel there's no point buying strong companies since their prices already reflect market's confidence in them.

D07 ETF has bad expRatio.

-- new: BITO ETF with dividend yield

-- update bpost on long-term SG inflation
K.Hu suggested roaming retirement to Malaysia. Singapore is susceptible to imported inflation but not Malaysia.
Switzerland is luckier than Sgp because its neighbors are rich, developed economies. This also means Switzerland citizens don't have a next-door neighbor as a low-cost retirement destination. Sgp has JB

Some x% inflation rate over some 20Y translate to perhaps 50% commulative inflation in Sgp. Malaysia cost level is much lower and will address that level of commulative inflation.

SGX blue chip stocks are an inflation hedge. 

STI ETF? has expRatio, inferior to single names

SP500 ETF is a classic inflation hedge.


-- new: %%SP500 position: greed^fear
Perhaps accumulate at a slower pace rather than cash out. This is the DCA philosophy. DCA is esp. proven in SP500.

My s27 position is good. Average cost probably around $500. If I liquidate all, I make a handsome profit. Then I could start from a clean slate.
SellAll can cause regret if sp500 keeps climbing and my SRS 60k idle cash earns a paltry SSB DIR

If I hold and then suffer paper loss together with everyone else (DCA..), I would feel "safe" in the bandwagon, protected from blame.

Now is fear time for many. Buffett said something like "Be greedy when market is fearful." but he is reducing his positions.

-- update bpost: cpfSA will disappear after 55, so you can't treat it as a 4 ppa flexible savings 

-- update bpost on hsbc.cn
practice log-in once a month. Slightly easier to recover lost password than ICBC

After you reinstall mobank, you  need to enter your existing passwd twice, then recreate mobilePIN. 

global transfer may have a USD 50k/Y limit
deposit USD .. 50k/Y limit, spaced out[2]
There's no FOC way to get more USD into hsbc.cn. USD transfer from another bank is unlikely to be FOC. I am not allowed to buy USD as a foreigner, except the "emergency $500"

[2] Too-frequent deposits may attract unwanted attention. Luckily counter staff would remind customers before it happens.

If we stop paying premium, then AIA will deduct $28/M charges by redeeming from the investment portion.

SRS to pay for AIA premium? No

Some investment salesmen or authors pose the question "Do you think you are an effective investor?" Some friends also pose that question.

The investment management industry has an industry standard about picking a "benchmark" for each managed product, because the benchmark is a crucial factor (in performance evaluation etc). Most investment managers choose some index. They think their index is fair. I guess so. 

I don't bother to find a fair benchmark for my portfolio. It's too complicated and touches a raw nerve.

Those salesmen tend to suggest an implicit benchmark on my performancce, but is it fair? I feel those implicit benchmarks tend to be very high and therefore unfair.

I feel a retail investor is considered fairly /successful/ ("doing fine") if his long-term return beats DIR [deposit IR] with a reasonable volatility.

Even with very low annual income, I should start HRBlock process as early as possible. Every week counts towards stress reduction and stress prevention.

-- update https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/43456/y-per-financetop-strength/
Since 2010s I have had a consistent assessment that pff is my strongest hand, strongest tectonic plate, and my "best-performing" game, in terms of personal efficacy, battery, accumulation,,,

Money can be kept in a bank and preserved, like batteries. (Few other things can.) Inflation is the enemy.
Money is one thing I can pass to my kids. If I stay healthy, I can provide stewardship of a multi-gen reserve.

Luckily for me, there are non-financial "legacies" in which I have confidence. I spent lots of time with my kids and influence them.

Q: r-ikigai?

-- fuxi: the will-preparation process has a focusing effect. We are nudged to focus on various worst-case scenarios of early death. Within this tunnel vision, long-term investments appear to be too risky and unsuitable. We are nudged to favor very short-term investment strategies. It's risk-averse to the extreme.

Even if we transition to such a portfolio, there's no guarantee that my offspring would actually fare better. There could be currency devaluation, high inflation, irresponsible spending ...

If you want to maximize cpfLife, then
1) top up cpfRA to the max (4x BRS) at 55
2) don't withdraw. Let it grow at 4%. Your max cpfRA balance will grow faster than the ERS_index grows.

-- fuxi or update (which) bpost on inflation
I see the huge effort by PAP government to manage inflation and preserve purchasing power of the national currency.
Now I feel very low inflation is unnatural, unsustainable (in an inflationary global ecosystem) and potentially harmful to the local economy.
