Link to this bpost from the "liquidity parking" bpost

-- new: lock up 100k+ in cpf if no liquidity needs
Given a 100k idle cash portion, it is exposed to
* scam
* impulsive splurge
* adult children's request

If no "liquidity needs" after 65, then better lock it away in cpfLife forever.
If no "liquidity needs" after 55, then better lock it away in cpfRA. Note you still can withdraw FRS-BRS amount.

Q: how much locked up is too much?


-- fuxi: despite all the challenges in khm, I still feel lucky about USD demomination + local marketing agency + locally known developer + CapitaLand endorsement

Also, compare to most developed country rEstate (including Sg), my quantum is very much manageable.
I don't have a big big chunk stuck in one unit.
I also stopped overseas rEstate 

-- ask cpf on next appt
Maximum amount you can top up (to spouse) using CPF - $43,946.14 ???

After 55, I can withdraw FRS-BRS from cpfRA, but can I withdraw anything from cpfOA? What happens to the growing balance in cpfOA?
