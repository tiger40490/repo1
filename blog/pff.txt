start HRBlock process as early as possible. Every week counts towards stress reduction and stress prevention.

Advantage of physical over electronic USD cash -- competitive FX rate at /ffP/. (Not so relevant when I have surplus SGD in the foreseeable future.)
To use it, you must pick a date decisively, and subsequently refuse to give in to regret.

Note every "3M parking in locker" leads to 1% lost interest (opp cost)
Also, you need a safe storage at home .. during those few months .

Default plan -- deposit and pay 0.5% handling fee. You can "recover" within 1.5 month, thanks to the current high-interest.

Citi 0.5% (min USD 10) but only one branch
.. CitiGold (250k) -- 0.25% only.
Hsbc Premier 0.75%
BOC 1%
DBS, OCBC .. even worse

https://www.sc.com/sg/save/current-accounts/usd-high-account/ (priority clients) .. 1.5% waived :)

-- update old-age BBB/RRR complexity
Ranking in terms of complexity and tcost of ownership: 
RBBT ownership has better stress-cost thanks to the pre-payment option.
FLI2 and other bx products.. obligation to pay premium on time, but you are free to pay earlier or slightly later.
promotional DIR like 3.7 ppa .. obligation to recon interest calc.
HSBC 3.6 ppa .. many conditions. Many headaches if I want to avoid losing the interest
tBill ownership cost is even lower.

Since 2010s I have had a consistent assessment that pff is my strongest hand, strongest tectonic plate, and my "best-performing" game, in terms of personal efficacy, battery, accumulation,,,

Money can be kept in a bank and preserved, like batteries. (Few other things can.) Inflation is the enemy.
Money is one thing I can pass to my kids. If I stay healthy, I can provide stewardship of a multi-gen reserve.

Luckily for me, there are non-financial "legacies" in which I have confidence. I spent lots of time with my kids and influence them.

If you want to maximize cpfLife, then
1) top up cpfRA to the max (4x BRS) at 55
2) don't withdraw. Let it grow at 4%. Your max cpfRA balance will grow faster than the ERS_index grows.

Freedom from worry about annual fee
Freedom from anxiety over large credit limit

-- fuxi or update (which) bpost on inflation
I see the huge effort by PAP government to manage inflation and preserve purchasing power of the national currency.
Now I feel very low inflation is unnatural, unsustainable (in an inflationary global ecosystem) and potentially harmful to the local economy.
