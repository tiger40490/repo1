MLP group-CI is late-stage-37

-- fuxi: BOC mobank can use PayNowQR, not the red SGQR

-- fuxi: the will-preparation process has a focusing effect. We are nudged to focus on various worst-case scenarios of early death. Within this tunnel vision, long-term investments appear to be too risky and unsuitable. We are nudged to favor very short-term investment strategies. It's risk-averse to the extreme.

Even if we transition to such a portfolio, there's no guarantee that my offspring would actually fare better. There could be currency devaluation, high inflation, irresponsible spending ...

-- update ...
before wife's cpfSA is closed, top it up to the max ... 250k or whatever.

Beside S27 and the DJ product, are there other US ETFs listed on SGX?

Some investment salesmen or authors pose the question "Do you think you are an effective investor?" Some friends also pose that question.

The investment management industry has an industry standard about picking a "benchmark" for each managed product, because the benchmark is a crucial factor (in performance evaluation etc). Most investment managers choose some index. They think their index is fair. I guess so. 

I don't bother to find a fair benchmark for my portfolio. It's too complicated touches a raw nerve.

Those salesmen tend to suggest an implicit benchmark on my performancce, but is it fair? I feel those implicit benchmarks tend to be very high and therefore unfair.

I feel a retail investor is considered fairly /successful/ ("doing fine") if his long-term return beats DIR [deposit IR] with a reasonable volatility.

-- AIA bigger plan (for wife) has SGD 30k for CI-early

If we stop paying prem, then AIA will deduct $28/M charges by redeeming from the investment portion.

SRS to pay for AIA premium? No

-- udpate or fuxi
start HRBlock process as early as possible. Every week counts towards stress reduction and stress prevention.

-- new: Manage USD notes carried into SGP
Advantage of physical over electronic USD cash -- competitive FX rate at /ffP/. (Not so relevant when I have surplus SGD in the foreseeable future.)
To use it, you must pick a date decisively, and subsequently refuse to give in to regret.

Note every "3M parking in locker" leads to 1% lost interest (opp cost)
Also, you need a safe storage at home .. during those few months .

Default plan -- deposit and pay 0.5% handling fee. You can "recover" within 1.5 month, thanks to the current high-interest.

Citi 0.5% (min USD 10) but only one branch
.. CitiGold (250k) -- 0.25% only.
Hsbc Premier 0.75%
BOC 1%
DBS, OCBC .. even worse

https://www.sc.com/sg/save/current-accounts/usd-high-account/ (priority clients) .. 1.5% waived :)

-- update https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/43456/y-per-financetop-strength/
Since 2010s I have had a consistent assessment that pff is my strongest hand, strongest tectonic plate, and my "best-performing" game, in terms of personal efficacy, battery, accumulation,,,

Money can be kept in a bank and preserved, like batteries. (Few other things can.) Inflation is the enemy.
Money is one thing I can pass to my kids. If I stay healthy, I can provide stewardship of a multi-gen reserve.

Luckily for me, there are non-financial "legacies" in which I have confidence. I spent lots of time with my kids and influence them.

Q: r-ikigai?

If you want to maximize cpfLife, then
1) top up cpfRA to the max (4x BRS) at 55
2) don't withdraw. Let it grow at 4%. Your max cpfRA balance will grow faster than the ERS_index grows.

-- fuxi: How do I feel about terminating the Citi SMRT card? 
Freedom from worry about annual fee
Freedom from anxiety over large credit limit

-- fuxi or update (which) bpost on inflation
I see the huge effort by PAP government to manage inflation and preserve purchasing power of the national currency.
Now I feel very low inflation is unnatural, unsustainable (in an inflationary global ecosystem) and potentially harmful to the local economy.

-- noblog: I'm lucky, thank God or perhaps due to Karma
* Citi.sg USD 3690 TD renewable even though that amount was then below SGD 5k
* MLP allows me to keep Rbh and all the positions.
