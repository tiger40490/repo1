-- update ...
Related to "return", another major tcost and stressor is keeping track of "stuff bought and disused long ago".

When I lose such an item (perhaps at home or discarded), and have to buy again, I feel an acute self-hate.

-- fuxi or update ...
More frequent usage (and carrying) paper money increases risk of loss
but it gives me better feel for the outflow.

sugg: pay offlines for all small amounts.
sugg: keep $50 notes in several places like office, cockpit1, cockpit4

It's hard to find property in SG below market value, but some sReits trade below NAV.

How are market value and NAV computed?

-- Steven's checklist for SgCP (buying): 
1. understand your risk level
2. budget
3. understandd your "purpose" .. like income or windfall
4. holding period
5. location .. comes after those 4 introspections
6. exit plan

Given the large quantum, I think a single SgCP investment can affect your entire family over decades or over generations. Therefore, it require lots of introspection and soul-searching.

If it still feels uncomfortable, then the quantum is too large for you, or the uncertainty is too high for you.

-- freehold units are more costly, therefore lower yield.

-- new: Sg strata mall units
windfall appr is hard for strata units. In other words, expensive. 

Also hard to fill. Brand new strata mall ... don't buy.

Reit is "totally different" from physical SgCP

-- FnB unit psf rent (not GRY) is higher than shops.
If unprofitable, FnB tenants tend to find takeover tenants, while shop tenants tend to give up the lease. Even a long-term lease may not provide much protection. 3Y is usually the max.

Exhaust provision is a key feature for FnB units, more important than waterpoint.

-- Steven's 3 points for SgCP buying: 1) tenanted 2) tenant profile 3) NRY
If agent says a vacant (office, industrial, shop...) unit can be rented out as xxxx or yyyy, then ask the agent to rent out first before you evaluate the unit. 

-- fuxi my recent investment track record is not so prudent
* HY/PE
* Saxo FXO

-- Reit ETFs?
diversify to other countries? Most of my Reits are US. One is SG. No other countries.

I can buy a few shares of Reit ETF (actually any SGX ETF) to try.

pre-clearance ? some of these have > 25 holdings.

SGX reit etf has high expRatio than US reit ETF! Need to find out the US numbers.
