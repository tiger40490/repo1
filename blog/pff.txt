-- update bpost on repurchase ^ div

Div is funded by profit. Repurchase can be funded by debt

Div can cause an immediate price drop. Repurchase has a long-term effect of boosting share price.

Repurchase cuts shares outstanding, and usually increase per-share measures of profitability like earnings-per-share (EPS),  and improve performance measures like ROE.

You're not required to sell your shares when a buyback is initiated. If you keep your stocks, your percentage of ownership in the issuing company will increase as other investors sell theirs.
