my recurring sentiment about my US cmc peers
Most of my U.S. cmc peers have double income, much higher than my single income.

Now I feel that's about the only advantage they have over me. 

wellness .. am better than majority of them
family harmony .. they are not better. Look at my bonding with my kids
marriage .. mine is more stable than many of them including those divorced
edu credentials .. mine is higher than most of them
long-term financial support by the state .. my gov is better than theirs by a large margin
pff .. despite their much higher income, I don't feel they are actually better off. This is just like latency race .. what's enough?

CPI reached 4% in 2021. 

The authors claimed that "Inflation has been high chiefly because of the unprecedented stimulus from fiscal and monetary policies worldwide"

The authors characterized the current situation as "a large amount of cash and a small supply of goods"... referring to QE and supply-chain disruptions during the pandemic.

-- new: unstable marriage of two high flyers
Q: given the cashflow high ground, how could H.Yi improve their marriage and communication.

A: professional couple counselling. This service costs a lot in the U.S.
A: hire a maid to reduce the home-making workload on each parent

Perhaps emmigrate to a lower-income country where systems are less complex and everyday life simpler and more convenient.

Suprisingly, the high ground doesn't provide enough of a buffer of protection against marital risks. The high ground improves risks related to family cashflow, but the high-earning wife is also very independent and doesn't want to play a supporting role to the husband. Not a risk factor in itself, but in some cases, this can indirectly create new risks. Many divorce cases involve two high-income earners.

A lower-class stable couple (earning 100k/Y) look at the higher-class the Yi's with envy. But would the Yi's envy the stable marriage of the lower-class couple? I think Yi's xpSelf would. 

Now 100k/Y is well above the median household income, so why would this couple still envy the Yi's. Would a $400k couple envy someone still higher? It's endless like the low-latency arms race.

Now am inundated, I realized the maintenance effort of investment assets:
* truly passive income is rare. Cambodia is much closer to ideal than BGC is. 
* Local agent does add some value... Am willing to pay a decent fee
* recreational MOETF is good in terms of zero obligation (to invest more)
* babysitt on existing positions would be unsustainable
