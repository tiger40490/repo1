two components
aa) a fixed-income mutual fund (can switch to SP500 fund but unkeen)
bb) an annuity with 10Y prison_term and no guaranteed surrender value

The (aa) provides "lifetime" payout and some capital protection.
The (bb) provides death/TPD benefit and nothing much

M1 M13 M25 M37 M49 then take prem holiday without charge

* Early-Surrender charges (within MIP) .. is one of the most important factors. Need to understand the "descending". Drops to 0% after MIP

Comparing against cpfLife and annuities
* surrender value .. in between
* prison_term .. in between

-- new ##advantages of cpf over private annuities
* same policy for everyone. Easy to find answers online.
* hotline 
* service centers
* monthly payout amount stays constant, provided cpf int rate stays constant.

-- update which bposts

Yes you can still treat RA as a savings acct. Suppose at 55 your SA balance is 512k when prevailing FRS is 500k. the FRS amount will transfer to RA, and the balance to OA. After that, by pledging your property, you can incrementally withdraw the (FRS-BRS) amount from RA. Meanwhile, you can also top up RA (see separate bpost)

cpf appt: 8.30am is better

-- new cpfRA top-up till startOfPayout
Every year, you can top up RA_bookVal to the prevailing ERS. All RA_accrued_interest goes to your RA, but excluded from RA_bookVal.

After startOfPayout (age 65 to 70), your interest accrual would start going into the pool. (RA emptied.)

Also, compare to most developed country rEstate (including Sg), my quantum is very much manageable.
