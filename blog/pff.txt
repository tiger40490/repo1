-- update bpost on 500k mtg
Proposal: use cpf alone to pay monthly. Every 2.5k absorbed into mtg, I would soon cash-refund back to cpf.

Benefit: virtually no default risk. 
Benefit: i have a justification to keep high balance in cpfOA to enjoy 2.5% interest
benefit: exp recon will not include any monthly noise. Will only show bulk transfers "housing refund"
drawback: paid^earned interest tally will be messy. I will use year-end official records from OC and CPF.

to earn more interest, I need to keep very high cpfOA, but that would reduce my flexibility. But this problem is there even if I don't use cpf for mtg.

-- update bpost on low-latency?
I envy the LkP early investor who made perhaps a million paper profit, but hey, he also envies me for
* my high annual salary. Total salary would exceed his paper profit in a few years
* my wellness + family harmony

He would also envy the bigger investors who made $2M .. low-latency arms race! What's enough? Pehraps half a million

Bedok central -- closer to ChBP
Bishan, AMK
CCK .. familiar rural location

TPY will maintain a location advantage as the northern parts improve.

Now am inundated, I realized the maintenance effort of investment assets:
* truly passive income is rare. Cambodia is much closer to ideal than BGC is. 
* Local agent does add some value... Am willing to pay a decent fee
* recreational MOETF is good in terms of zero obligation (to invest more)
* babysitt on existing positions would be unsustainable
