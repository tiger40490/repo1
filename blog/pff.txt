In the subway system, we can see evidence of the fiscal discipline and cost efficiency of U.S. vs SG.
Adjusted for ridership, I guess the budget is no higher in SG, but the quality is much better in terms of frequency, cleanliness, probability of delays, customer service,,,

Without enough data, I can only hypothesize that SG system is more judicious/careful with public spending.

U.S. corporations and individuals pay much higher taxes, but governments run deficits every year. Therefore, public debt increases every year to cover the deficit.

Let's look beyond the subway system. Most Americans, rich or poor, get a much worse deal in terms of public service per tax dollar paid. Therefore, top American employers spend a lot to provide the "public" service that's wanted but missing. In other words, private employers step in to cover the gap between the limited public services and what employees need.

Looking into the numbers, another reason for the excellent service/tax ratio in Singapore is the non-tax income to the SG government. That includes profit from government-linked companies, and sovereign funds. 

I guess a less discussed reason is rEstate appreciation, which is stronger in SG. I guess that land sale revenue (to government) was much lower a decade ago. Also, many local rEstate assets are owned by government-linked companies, and these assets appreciate much faster than in the U.S.

Nearest to a time of xjl crunch, MOETF could hit a crash.

I think this is one of top 3 reasons why most people hesitate about long-term commitment to the (risky) stock market.

.. Around age 30 (perhaps 25-35), most of us need liquidity for our xjl crunch, so we tend to sell equity when we want to cut losses. This cohort lack patience, stamina or holding power. When these investors see a large (realized or unrelized) equity loss, they tend to regret investing such a large amount in such a risky asset. Therefore, it's a challenge for this age group to buy-n-hold.

.. In our sunset years, we worry that we may not have the Sys2 resources to monitor MOETF. The start age of sunset years varies. Some may experience that difficulty when they start to withdraw from retirement account, so they experience a xjl crunch. They find it difficulty to liquidate stocks to support retirement expenses.

SG and HK economies experienced fast ascent from 3rd world to 1st world.

This is rather rare. Most rEstate markets do not experience the same.

At NUS while I was immersed in academic study, there is a lot of chatter among fellow students, about investment and leveraged trading. 
At that time, a senior engineer could make 5k but active trading could generate 100k/Y profit.

Now in my late 40s I have a different perception -- unrealized profit is not an income replacement. Consistent quarterly cash payout is, but much harder to achieve.

with current income, we feel confident to spend the income.
With unrealized gains
* sometimes we can't quickly cash out .. consider rEstate
* sometimes the bid/ask or commission is too high .. consider bccy
* sometimes the paper profit can quickly turn into paper loss

Suppose you a wealthy semi-retiree. Many people want (to be the parking space for) your money.

eg: insurers want your money. Insurance plans are usually long-term commitments. If you surrender your policy half-way, you lose and they "lose". They charge you a "penalty" to avoid a financial loss.
eg: some retirement destinations want you to park your money there for X years, and give you a special visa. You are free to withdraw it after X years
eg: Private banks want your money to be deposited, even in a savings account. They know from experience you are unlikely to move out of it soon. They estimate you would be with them for 1Y so meanwhile they can use your fund for their liquidity needs.
eg: Many immigration authorities want you to invest a million with them, and create local jobs. It's still your money, that you can withdraw, as long as those jobs are mainained.
eg: FDI [foreign direct investment] is on a larger scale but inherently similar. An industrialist invests millions in China and can withdraw it any time, but she is likely to stay invested for a few years. So China benefits hugely not only in job-creation.

The key is long-term commitment. If long-enough, then the parking entity has free use of your fund almost as if you donated to them.
