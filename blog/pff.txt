-- new: how to handle USD notes{PEK
Advantage of physical over electronnic -- competitive FX rate at /ffP/. 
To use it, you must pick a date and refuse to give in to retrospective regret.
Note every 3M or so waiting in locker has a 1% lost interest (opp cost)
Also, you need a safe storage at home.

Default plan -- deposit and pay 0.5% handling fee. You can "recover" within 1.5 month, thanks to the current high-interest.

Since 2010s I have had a consistent assessment that pff is my strongest hand, strongest tectonic plate, and my "best-performing" game, in terms of personal efficacy, battery, accumulation,,,

Money can be kept in a bank and preserved, like batteries. (Few other things can.) Inflation is the enemy.
Money is one thing I can pass to my kids. If I stay healthy, I can provide stewardship of a multi-gen reserve.

Luckily for me, there are non-financial "legacies" in which I have confidence. I spent lots of time with my kids and influence them.

Q: r-ikigai?

-- update (which) bpost on inflation
I see the huge effort by PAP government to manage inflation and preserve purchasing power of the national currency.
Now I feel very low inflation is unnatural, unsustainable (in an inflationary global ecosystem) and potentially harmful to the local economy.

grandparents have financial freedom due to healthcare and SGD 4k+ of pension. This ffree is a big advantage esp. to the adult children, but it doesn't really make their lives a bliss.
