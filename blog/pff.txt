-- update bpost on U.S. household contingency reserve
As of 2019, the typical Black or Hispanic family has $2,000 or less in liquid savings, the typical White family has more than four times that amount.

-- update "buy without oth"
Related to "merchandize return", another major tcost and stressor is keeping track of "stuff bought and disused long ago".

When I lose such an item (perhaps at home or discarded), and have to buy again, I feel an acute self-hate, but this self-hate goes against use-without-care

-- update bpost on US taxes
Q: is it unlawful, unethical to put incorrect data on tax returns?
IRS is understaffed. Their fraud surveillance system is increasingly automated to reduce labor cost.

The ROI of the audit system has a numerator measured in (lost tax) dollars recovered. Therefore, if your taxable income is a small sum, then I doubt they would both analyzing it. 

Similarly, when I set out to free up my gmail storage, I won't spend time on small disk hogs.

I contributed tax dollars during my 8Y stay, and won't receive any benefit in return. This is "The_system", unfair to H1B immigrants like me.

-- new: car cost after any burst@carefree-bubble
Private car TOC often takes on a new dimension when you find yourself on a cashflow low ground, or when your carefree-bubble bursts.
* when a family member is in long-term care
* when jobless
* when in bad weather .. emergency repairs costs more
* when we are physically challenged due to eyesight or disability. We might need taxi.
* when we are used to having two cars but then both cars give problems.
* when our driving privilege is suspended

Much better if we live in a well-connected location with public transport.

-- update bpost on income vs wealth stats
Wealth (net asset) statistics are often based on surveys (including questionnaires). However, home equity, brokerage portfolios, 401k, SSA account.. are reported to U.S. government. 

Income statistics are mostly based on tax filing and more accurate.

There are unreported incomes and unreported assets. I won't speculate which of the two is a bigger problem to the statistician.

XianHua said a U.S. retiree in his case 
* receives $1400/M from SSA

More frequent usage of (and carrying) paper money increases risk of loss
but it gives me better feel for the outflow.
I think this risk is an inherent risk with paper money, to be accepted and managed.

sugg: pay offlines for all small amounts.
sugg: keep $50 notes in several places like office, cockpit1, cockpit4

It's hard to find property in SG below market value, but some sReits trade below NAV.
