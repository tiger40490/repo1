Since 2010s I have had a consistent assessment that pff is my strongest hand, strongest tectonic plate, and my "best-performing" game, in terms of personal efficacy, accumulation,,,

Money is one thing I can pass to your kids. If I stay healthy, I can provide stewardship of a multi-gen reserve.

Luckily for me, there are non-financial "legacies" in which I have confidence. I spent lots of time with my kids and influence them.

I see the huge effort by the government (among many national governments) to manage inflation and preserve purchasing power of the national currency.
Now I feel deflation or very low inflation is unnatural, unsustainable (in an inflationary global ecosystem) and potentially harmful to the local economy.

Money can be kept in a bank and preserved. Very few other things can.

Q: r-ikigai?

--update jolt: car ownership in SG
I used to feel inferior to those with a car.
Now I feel I don't need a car in SG. The flexibility benefit is minimal.

Previsouly, my sense of inadequacy regarding car ownership is based on ignorance, hearsay and poor critical thinking, but such naivity is universal just like my perceived weakness in self-control. As I told Bindi, everyone is weak, but the 10-year old tanbin doesn't know it.

many purchases were buy-without-OT but the rmSelf would inevitably become critical and we will remember the purchase as a failure.

-- update bpost on repurchase ^ div
Div is funded by profit. Repurchase can be funded by debt

Div can cause an immediate price drop. Repurchase has a long-term effect of boosting share price.

Repurchase cuts shares outstanding, and usually increase per-share measures of profitability like earnings-per-share (EPS),  and improve performance measures like ROE.

You're not required to sell your shares when a buyback is initiated. If you keep your stocks, your percentage of ownership in the issuing company will increase as other investors sell theirs.

-- update which bpost?
grandparents have financial freedom due to healthcare and pension. This ffree is a big advantage esp. to the adult children, but it doesn't really make their lives a bliss.

--fuxi: I used to believe personal investment effort (FSM etc) is more strategic than QQ because I felt I could grow my portfolio.
Now my confidence in this effort is much lower, so I dare not put in a lot.

Also, after trying multiple investment products I realized that luck+timing is a much bigger factor than skill or (Buffett style) analysis. 

--fuxi: SRS account in DBS/posb
$15,300/Y max deposit into this account as tax exempt income. Tax saving of more than $2.4k/Y 
After 5Y (say 2030) can withdraw as 2030 income but my tax bracket in 2030 would be the lowest, because first 40k in 2030 is not taxed in Singapore.

Before 2030, During the 5Y lock-in, withdrawal penalty is 5%. Without withdrawal, we can freely invest the SRS balance into FSM not stocks.

better deposit close to end of the tax year, so most of the year I enjoy the liquidity.

Also invest some cpf OA balance into FSM
