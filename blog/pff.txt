Q: is it unlawful, unethical to put incorrect info on tax returns?
I believe the IRS is understaffed. The audit system is increasingly automated to reduce labor cost.

The ROI of the audit system has a numerator measured in (lost tax) dollars recovered. Therefore, if your tax income is a small figure, then I believe they won't spend time analyzing it. I think each case they pursue can become difficult, in terms of legwork/analysis.

Similarly, when I set out to free up my gmail storage, I won't spend time on small disk hogs.

By right, I contributed tax dollars during my 8Y stay, and won't receive any benefit in return. This is "The_system", unfair to H1B immigrants like me.

-- new: car cost after bubble burst
car cost takes on a new dimension on a cashflow low ground, or when the bubble bursts.
* when a family member is in long-term care
* when we are jobless
* when in bad weather .. emergency repairs costs more
* when we are physically challenged due to eyesight or disability. We might need taxi.

Much better if we live in a well-connected location with public transport.

Related to "merchandize return", another major tcost and stressor is keeping track of "stuff bought and disused long ago".

When I lose such an item (perhaps at home or discarded), and have to buy again, I feel an acute self-hate.

More frequent usage of (and carrying) paper money increases risk of loss
but it gives me better feel for the outflow.
I think this risk is an inherent risk with paper money, to be accepted and managed.

sugg: pay offlines for all small amounts.
sugg: keep $50 notes in several places like office, cockpit1, cockpit4
