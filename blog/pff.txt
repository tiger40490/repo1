Let's remove it from my bpost on SG ccards
How do I feel about terminating the Citi SMRT card? 
Freedom from worry about annual fee
Freedom from anxiety over large credit limit

-- new: UnionPay to buy bx ]SG
SCB confirme: all wealth products are payable by SG-based visa/master, not overseas visa/master, and not UnionPay

-- new: Manage USD notes carried into SGP
Advantage of physical over electronic USD cash -- competitive FX rate at /ffP/. (Not so relevant when I have surplus SGD in the foreseeable future.)
To use it, you must pick a date decisively, and subsequently refuse to give in to regret.

Note every "3M parking in locker" leads to 1% lost interest (opp cost)
Also, you need a safe storage at home .. during those few months .

Default plan -- deposit and pay 0.5% handling fee. You can "recover" within 1.5 month, thanks to the current high-interest.

Citi 0.5% (min USD 10) but only one branch
.. CitiGold (250k) -- 0.25% only.
Hsbc Premier 0.75%
BOC 1%
DBS, OCBC .. even worse

https://www.sc.com/sg/save/current-accounts/usd-high-account/ (priority clients) .. 1.5% waived :)

-- new: physical USD out of China
Exit from China custom... USD 5k/passenger.. including children :)
PVG security officer found my cash pouch and sent that item through the scanner all by itself! 
Officer made no noise, presumably because she was looking for anything dangerous.
I think officer is "permitted" to either count the notes or "close one eye". Closing one eye, even under /CCTV/, is not a negligence.

-- update bpost
USD transfer Citi.sg -> other SG banks .. lowest cost is USD3 for each personal cheque. 
To receive a new cheque book, request online and pay $15
These are truly negligible costs in this era.

-- update old-age BBB/RRR complexity
Ranking in terms of complexity and tcost of ownership: 
RBBT ownership has better stress-cost thanks to the pre-payment option.
FLI2 and other bx products.. obligation to pay premium on time
promotional DIR like 3.7 ppa .. obligation to recon interest calc
tBill ownership cost is even lower.

-- fuxi
lifestyle creep .. increasing recently
* tuition
* dining

-- update bpost on RBBT
Biggest risk is neglecting the 6M anniversary. Better set a reminder 1M in advance.

135k x (3.7%-1.88%) for half a year is about $1100+

-- update https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/43456/y-per-financetop-strength/
Since 2010s I have had a consistent assessment that pff is my strongest hand, strongest tectonic plate, and my "best-performing" game, in terms of personal efficacy, battery, accumulation,,,

Money can be kept in a bank and preserved, like batteries. (Few other things can.) Inflation is the enemy.
Money is one thing I can pass to my kids. If I stay healthy, I can provide stewardship of a multi-gen reserve.

Luckily for me, there are non-financial "legacies" in which I have confidence. I spent lots of time with my kids and influence them.

Q: r-ikigai?

-- update (which) bpost on inflation
I see the huge effort by PAP government to manage inflation and preserve purchasing power of the national currency.
Now I feel very low inflation is unnatural, unsustainable (in an inflationary global ecosystem) and potentially harmful to the local economy.

-- fuxi or update bpost on ffree in my family
grandparents have financial freedom due to healthcare and SGD 4k+ of pension. This ffree is a big advantage esp. to the adult children, but it doesn't really make their lives a bliss.

-- noblog: I'm lucky, thank God or perhaps due to Karma
* Citi.sg USD 3690 TD renewable even though that amount was then below SGD 5k
* MLP allows me to keep Rbh and all the positions.
