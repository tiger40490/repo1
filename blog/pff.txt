--new or update paypal
An email address (rather than phone num) is the primary login for a paypal account.

If an email address is linked to a paypal US account, then you aren't allowed to link it to a Sg account. You must use another email address.

It's considered unsafe to keep paypal accounts inactive (breeding ground for financial crime). Therefore, Paypal would email periiodic reminders to inactive account owners. If you don't like those reminders, then better close the account. It's easy to reopen paypal accounts.

I feel sReit is more transparent than usReit, largely due to the higher regulation.

The sReit operators are all well-known. Many of them are government-linked. As such, they are very low-risk in terms of govenance.

There are relatively few variations (a form of cognitive complexity) among the sReits.

-- fuxi: CapitaLand is probably less successful less in-control in overseas projects. Don't assign the same value to CapitaLand when the country is not Sg !

-- update 1 preclear a day
