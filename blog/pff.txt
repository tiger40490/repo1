Suppose you a wealthy semi-retiree. Many people want (to be the parking space for) your money.

eg: insurers want your money. Insurance plans are usually long-term commitments. If you surrender your policy half-way, you lose and they "lose". They charge you a "penalty" to avoid a financial loss.
eg: some retirement destinations want you to park your money there for X years, and give you a special visa. You are free to withdraw it after X years
eg: Private banks want your money to be deposited, even in a savings account. They know from experience you are unlikely to move out of it soon. They estimate you would be with them for 1Y so meanwhile they can use your fund for their liquidity needs.
eg: Many immigration authorities want you to invest a million with them, and create local jobs. It's still your money, that you can withdraw, as long as those jobs are mainained.
eg: FDI [foreign direct investment] is on a larger scale but inherently similar. An industrialist invests millions in China and can withdraw it any time, but she is likely to stay invested for a few years. So China benefits hugely not only in job-creation.

The key is long-term commitment. If long-enough, then the parking entity has free use of your fund almost as if you donated to them.

[[Irrational Exuberance]] has a brief debate on "smarter people will, in the long run, tend to do better at (stock) investing". There are many complicating factors.

* muddy: For the independent varialbe, researchers would want to use IQ, or high-school test scores in math + mother-tongue-reasoning (universal subjects), but I know that many Asian teenage students are better-trained in taking tests than non-Asians. 
* muddy: Most people use some N-year total return of individual's eq portfolio as the dependent-variable. I think liquidity is crucial but not captured in total return. MOETF is more liquid than an ETF.

The most convincing argument for passive investing is that SP500 ETFs outperform many (not "most") professional portfolios, assuming minimal expRatio. Does it mean that smarter people don't outperform the average investor? No. That would be very flawed argument.

SP500 is among a handful of indices that are so hard to beat. The SP500 index committee is an active professional team.. smart people.

A smart investor often splits her portfolio between A) index-ETFs and B) MOETF, so she can outperform now and underperform later compared to SP500. Over the long run, she might outperform.

A smart investor often has more advisors and have access to training or data that help her spot opportunities and avoid missteps/swans. Not 100% but slightly lower chance of loss.

asset pricing theories are hard to validate, esp. compared to phy/che/med theorie. 
Very limited data available to use for validation. 

Nobel laureates are peer-reviewed experts. Most investment books are not so theoretical.
For all of these so-called experts, peer review is the best validation, better than popularity. 
Even a best-selling book with lots of media coverage can be proven invalid by the market a few decades later. 
Sometimes a theory is actually validated over a long horizon ... like 200 years! This is basically Fama's criticism of Shiller.

A peer-reviewed investment theory is more validated than a "popular" book, but not as validated as a chemistry theory.

Assuming BnH is a good thing, BNH is easier with real assets due to higher tx cost ?!

rEstate have much slower price changes than stocks.
If a real asset appreciates by 200%, it is likely more stable than stocks. We are more confident about its higher valuation.

with current income, we feel confident to spend the income.
With unrealized gains
* sometimes we can't quickly cash out .. consider rEstate
* sometimes the bid/ask or commission is too high .. consider bccy
* sometimes the paper profit can quickly turn into paper loss

SG and HK economies experienced fast ascent from 3rd world to 1st world.

This is rather rare. Most rEstate markets do not experience the same.
