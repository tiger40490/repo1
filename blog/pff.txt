Shall I buy some eqMufu on FSM?

If I buy $100, then tcost is too high including terminating RSP.

If I buy buy $1000, then due diligence tend to take much longer.

In all cases, ROTI is very poor compared to Rbh, partly due to expRatio.

-- update lifestyle creep
mixedVegRice used to be the best value in Singapore, either in coffee shops or food courts. No more.
I used to pick 2 veg or 1 veg 1 meat, for below $3.

Nowadays I eat out only once a month or so. I now pick 3 or 4 items for $4->5-6. I used to flinch at such price figures for mixedVegRice. Now I don't even notice my higher spend. 

The only explanation I have is higher disposable income and lifestyle creep.

Is if for nutrition? No. It's only for pleasure [variety]

-- update or new
conventional wisdom of eq outperforming bonds in the long run only works in the U.S. market and only if you don't pay the expRatio to a eqMufu.

H.Yi and AshS both mentioned something about trading time for money.
The idea is to make your money work harder to provide for family livelihood [3], so you don't need to. So you could spend your time on something else.

What's that something else? For me, it is some form of office work, rather than vacation.

[3] If we could _control_ exclub comparison, then livelihood burn rate can be taken care of already, so we don't need to work.

-- babysitting still required. Very few nonwork incomes are truly passive and buy-n-forget, like CPF [SA and cpfLife]. 

REIT and div-stocks require babysitting when DYOC declines.

Rental properties (like mine in S.E.Asia) require some work with the local agents.

If the passive income stops being passive, then you are still trading time for money. That includes rental property management and day trading.

t_creep
$2 wasted spend in Daiso .. is to be tolerated, given my nonwork incomes.
These spends won't accumulate beyond $1000/Y
ctbz in this case can be ineffective.

My due diligence (System 2) is sometimes too slow before spending such small amounts.  Let's record the small wasted spends so as to calibrate System 1.

-- buy-n-forget is not so easy with the bond mufu. The expRatio (?%) erodes the return. 
I may need to babysit my positions !

-- update income vs wealth 
(link from scorecard)
Some people are embarrassed to talk about (not necessarily personal) income, and prefer wealth instead.
Some people are embarrassed to talk about (not necessarily personal) wealth and prefer income instead.

These individuals may (subconsciously) prefer to steer the conversation.

small amount in FSM

--SRS: total SGD 15k invested

-- in U.S.
USD 2k GS shares
USD 20k in Roth401k target date fund
USD 2.5k in eqMufu
USD 10k in Rbh

-- new: Rbh process is highly efficient
Even safe bond funds on FSM involve much higher effort than my Robinhood process.

* problem: the amounts are too large, tyically 10k. Sugg: reduce to 1k
* risk/diligence: when I sell, I have to stay alert and ensure I don't sell the wrong lot i.e. from the wrong account
* the profit has to be recorded in my exp recon s/s
* I check the PnL for each position too often. 
* my tolerance is too low for large cash balance. sugg: accept 30k cash balance in cash account

It's crucial to be clear what exactly we want out of stock trading. Many valid priorities of other investors are not important to us. In fact, these OPPs (other people's priorities) may get in our way. 

* when you add those OPP, your life becomes more complicated, when it can be simpler like mine. You may have to babysit your positions. Your firewall is strained.
* when you add those OPP, your priority list would see some of your true priorities pushed down. Analog: carry-on luggage vs checked luggage.
* when you add those OPP, you may take on more risks.

when stock picking is an active recreation, then novelty becomes a non-trivial selection criteria. That favors international exotic names, and new names. 

However, I have bought a lot of high-yield names. The remaining names tend to be low-yield. Hard to find any suitable stocks.

-- slow-cooking new: high-yield, low growth, blue chips
T:US is probably a leading example.
Singtel is another well-known example.

How about the red chips? 
My view on gov red chips has changed. They seem to pay good dividends to compensate for very poor long-term trend.
Gary felt red chips are profitable businesses, but widely perceived as low efficiency, low margin.
U.S. dividend stocks offer better long-term prospect. The red chips don't qualify for my income ptf.

best China index
You can collect the count of tracking ETFs for each index. The most popular index is MSCI China.

Gary singled out FTSE A50.

Gary believed China ADR stocks are correlated with China index much more than SP500.

-- fuxi or update post on U.S. eq market strength
jolt: China is the growing economic superpower, rivaling U.S., but in terms of stocks potential, it lacks all of the power, trec, market support that's available in U.S. stocks.

SG, Germany, Australia ... also have strong, competitive economies but lack the same strengths of the U.S. stocks.

-- slow-cooking update livelihood blogs (S.Liu or Maslow)
[[Nomadland]] and many other movies and songs portray the livelihood pressures (even hardships) of ordinary people in relatively affluent locations (affluent as defined by global standard). For example, most Singaporeans would feel some livelihood pressure. 

For these individuals, my ezlife on the cash flow high ground is .. dream. 

I like mathematical criteria for that high ground, such as brbr, Fuller Wealth. By these criteria, my ezlife and my high ground are realistic for some of them, but they lack something to achieve the same.

Safe, clean street? No. This is not just for middle-class

appreciation is slow in most locations. Don't believe agents who boast their appreciation potential.

Foreigner demand is dampened by ABSD, esp. in non-prime locations. These locations are mostly sold to local buyers.
