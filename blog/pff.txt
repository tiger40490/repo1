I now feel China stocks are less familiar than U.S. stocks
* U.S. corporates answer to shareholders and try to create value for shareholders. (Same can be said of Singapore listed companies.) China's largest listed companies mostly answer to government. China companies seldom pay dividend. Out of the thousdans of China stocks, I'm sure some are well-managed, creating good shareholder values, but I don't know how to identify them.

* China A-shares are bought and sold mostly by retail investors. Retail investors are more irrational, leading to high volatility.

Q: when you read positive news about China stocks vs positive news about U.S. stocks, would you invest?

China news is state-controlled, esp. positive news. Even foreigne news agencies are "influenced". No such thing in the U.S., because news organizations are skeptical or critical about the Fed, White House or other government agencies.

In terms of earnings, China listed companies are more affected by government policy than their American peers. American large-caps are more global than China large-caps, so the former are less affected by U.S. government policies. 

Fundamentally, China remains a command economy, where the CCP has tight control over most listed companies. The 2021-2022 crackdown on tech companies was a recent example. I can't think of such a crackdown happening in the U.S.

Therefore, predicting policy change is key to investing in China stocks. Public news is tricky to follow.

-- update or new: enough nest egg2retire@current burn rate 
Claim: you can and need to invest in stocks since young.
My take: Only U.S. stocks...
Observation: many countries' public pension-like system pays you only a fraction of you "current" burn rate.

My Rule #1: be realisitc about retiring in style, and don't aim at current burn rate. Exclude housing and healthcare, aim at half the current burn rate.

My Rule #1b: from young age, take up the legwork to find long-term solutions for old age housing and healthcare.

As to stock investment, I don't know how reliable it is. What if you buy at the peak, and need to wait 20Y for a recovery?
-- update bpost on nightly FAST
I feel the $10/night earning is more strategic than the $200 credit card cashback, because
* it is recurring over several months.
* there is less uncertainty about the outcome

XianHua said a U.S. retiree in his case 
* receives $1400/M from SSA
* pays about $1500/M pTax if owning a home
* pays about $1000/M health insurance, much needed in old age

Sg offers a more affordable retirement, in terms of Melvin3.

With my increased Base salary (bonus is different story), how should we adjust our spending, savings etc?
* sugg: increase wealth accu for wife. cpfVcon is probably the most restrictive

-- update xxx or new: paper money in pff
More frequent usage of (and carrying) paper money increases risk of loss
but it can give me better feel for the outflow.
I think this is an inherent hazard with paper money, to be accepted and managed.

sugg: pay offlines for all small amounts.
sugg: keep $50 notes in several places like office, cockpit1, cockpit4
