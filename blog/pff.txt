-- new: most upgrading home buyers would max out their borrowing capacity
Delphia of oc is a mortgage specialist. She said majority of Singapore borrowers (probably including foreigners) would max out their loan quantum. One of the most important limits is TDSR. No more than 55% (was 60) of income (including CPF) is allowed to be used for installments. Lender and borrower would be caught in violation.

55% of total income spent on debt servicing .. sounds like low ground. 

I asked her why "majority" has such a motivation. Delphia said many want to maximize investment. (Delphia herself felt buying at the current price level doesn't sound like investment.) It's leveraged investment at a very low borrowing cost.

Now I recall Wallace Xu said something similar about American home buyers... they are highly sensitive to rate hike.

Better terminate citi credit card to clean up the report. But reapplying would take time.

When you apply for a loan, if you show income without credit card, you will appear risky as a borrower. Lender would hesitate to lend to you since there's no track record. It's better to get a credit card, use it a few times, then apply for loans.

The number that affects your max loan amount is the total of "unsecured" column, in the AggregateMonthlyInstalment table. In my case, I happened to have $50 minimum payment for HSBC card. This $50 went into my total.

What units face risk of price drop? Wife said older flats. I say on-the-run. The better question is "will the price gap widen or narrow, over our holding window?"

It's crucial to be clear what exactly we want out of stock trading. Many valid priorities of other investors are not important to us. In fact, these OPPs (other people's priorities) may get in our way. 

* when you add those OPP, your life becomes more complicated, when it can be simpler like mine. You may have to babysit your positions. Your firewall is strained.
* when you add those OPP, your priority list would see some of your true priorities pushed down. Analog: carry-on luggage vs checked luggage.
* when you add those OPP, you may inadvertently take on more risks.

Matching SP500 return ... is a bad OPP
Investing 80% of my assets, and minimizing idle cash ... is an OPP

primary goal of exp recon is .. expense analysis
A minor goal is liquid NAV tracking. This goal doesn't require complicated system. Accuracy and reliability is extremely valuable. The expense recon provides exactly that quality assurance.

-- update lifestyle creep
mixedVegRice used to be the best value in Singapore, either in coffee shops or food courts. No more.
I used to pick 2 veg or 1 veg 1 meat, for below $3.

Nowadays I eat out only once a month or so. I now pick 3 or 4 items for $4->5-6. I used to flinch at such price figures for mixedVegRice. Now I don't even notice my higher spend. 

The only explanation I have is higher disposable income and lifestyle creep.

Is if for nutrition? No. It's only for pleasure [variety]

I may need to babysit my positions !

-- slow-cooking update livelihood blogs (S.Liu or Maslow)
[[Nomadland]] and many other movies and songs portray the livelihood pressures (even hardships) of ordinary people in relatively affluent locations (affluent as defined by global standard). For example, most Singaporeans would feel some livelihood pressure. 

For these individuals, my ezlife on the cash flow high ground is .. but a dream. 

I like mathematical criteria for that high ground, criteria like brbr, Fuller Wealth. By these criteria, my ezlife and my high ground are realistic for some of them, but they lack key incredients.

In my GEX course, I could see the livelihood pressure of many Singapore /nationals/ in their 40s, 50s and 60s
