asset pricing theories are hard to validate, esp. compared to phy/che/med theorie. 
Very limited data available to use for validation. 

Nobel laureates are peer-reviewed experts. Most investment books are not so theoretical.
For all of these so-called experts, peer review is the best validation, better than popularity. 
Even a best-selling book with lots of media coverage can be proven invalid by the market a few decades later. 
Sometimes a theory is actually validated over a long horizon ... like 200 years! This is basically Fama's criticism of Shiller.

A peer-reviewed investment theory is more validated than a "popular" book, but not as validated as a chemistry theory.

Assuming BnH is a good thing, BNH is easier with real assets due to higher tx cost ?!

rEstate have much slower price changes than stocks.
If a real asset appreciates by 200%, it is likely more stable than stocks. We are more confident about its higher valuation.

SG and HK economies experienced fast ascent from 3rd world to 1st world.

This is rather rare. Most rEstate markets do not experience the same.
