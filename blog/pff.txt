Q: what form of money wasted (100k+) is irreversable?

eg: buying a deep OTM option
eg: investing in dubious unregulated securities like HY/PE, or bccy, or land banking
eg: buying expensive car.. As soon as you drive out, the car is worth 50% less 
eg: buying expensive medication.. Vendor won't accept return since you can't prove medication isn't stored somewhere.
eg: borrowing a large sum from a financial lender. U-turn is "permitted" at a prohibitive cost. Might be 20% of the amount ($500k) repaid. Might have a minimum fee exceeding your loan quantum. 
eg: buying some expensive wines. Once opened, you can't return it.

-- new: 子女 livelihood: no real concern
I did some simple math with my wife.

Assumption: grandparents don't spend too much of their current NAV on nursing homes or medical. 
.. Based on this assumption, after they pass on most of their NAV would eventually go to the 2 grandchildren. Perhaps SGD 2M ignoring inflation.

Assumption: Aunt Genn doesn't cash out on her Sydney home, and spend most of it. 
.. Based on this assumption, in 40 years she may pass on a large bequest to the 2 grown-up niece/nephew. I would be very old by then.

I will not discuss my own NAV.

All in all, my two kids could end up with about SGD 5M available to them during their (early to late) adulthood. 

I'm more concerned about my son. By age 25, I hope he will be mature enough to know budgeting, BurnRate control, risk-taking/risk-assessment, due-diligence, wealth preservation,,, With this maturity, he would take care of his inheritance.

Of course I hope to serve as their steward (guardian) till my 80s or even 90s, but I want to downplay this factor. I can't let them rely on my stewardship. By age 30 they will be independent.

I now feel China stocks are less familiar than U.S. stocks
* U.S. corporates answer to shareholders and try to create value for shareholders. (Same can be said of Singapore listed companies.) China's largest listed companies mostly answer to government. China companies seldom pay dividend. Out of the thousdans of China stocks, I'm sure some are well-managed, creating good shareholder values, but I don't know how to identify them.

* China A-shares are bought and sold mostly by retail investors. Retail investors are more irrational, leading to high volatility.

Q: when you read positive news about China stocks vs positive news about U.S. stocks, would you invest?

China news is state-controlled, esp. positive news. Even foreigne news agencies are "influenced". No such thing in the U.S., because news organizations are skeptical or critical about the Fed, White House or other government agencies.

In terms of earnings, China listed companies are more affected by government policy than their American peers. American large-caps are more global than China large-caps, so the former are less affected by U.S. government policies. 

Fundamentally, China remains a command economy, where the CCP has tight control over most listed companies. The 2021-2022 crackdown on tech companies was a recent example. I can't think of such a crackdown happening in the U.S.

Therefore, predicting policy change is key to investing in China stocks. Public news is tricky to follow.

Sg offers a more affordable retirement, in terms of Melvin3.

* sugg: increase wealth accu for wife. cpfVcon is probably the most restrictive

-- update xxx or new: paper money in pff
More frequent usage of (and carrying) paper money increases risk of loss
but it can give me better feel for the outflow.
I think this is an inherent hazard with paper money, to be accepted and managed.

sugg: pay offlines for all small amounts.
sugg: keep $50 notes in several places like office, cockpit1, cockpit4
