TPY will maintain a location advantage as the northern parts improve.
-- new: unstable marriage of two high flyers
Q: given the cashflow high ground, how could H.Yi improve their marriage and communication.

A: professional couple counselling. This service costs a lot in the U.S.
A: hire a maid to reduce the home-making workload on each parent

Perhaps emmigrate to a lower-income country where systems are less complex and everyday life simpler and more convenient.

Suprisingly, the high ground doesn't provide enough of a buffer of protection against marital risks. The high ground improves risks related to family cashflow, but the high-earning wife is also very independent and doesn't want to play a supporting role to the husband. Not a risk factor in itself, but in some cases, this can indirectly create new risks. Many divorce cases involve two high-income earners.

A lower-class stable couple (earning 100k/Y) look at the higher-class the Yi's with envy. But would the Yi's envy the stable marriage of the lower-class couple? I think Yi's xpSelf would. 

Now 100k/Y is well above the median household income, so why would this couple still envy the Yi's. Would a $400k couple envy someone still higher? It's endless like the low-latency arms race.

Now am inundated, I realized the maintenance effort of investment assets:
* truly passive income is rare. Cambodia is much closer to ideal than BGC is. 
* Local agent does add some value... Am willing to pay a decent fee
* recreational MOETF is good in terms of zero obligation (to invest more)
* babysitt on existing positions would be unsustainable
