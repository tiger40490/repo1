When I read books on REITs, I remember the AMB effort.. the differences in terms of reluctance.

I recall that when I was told stock picking requires reading financial statements, I balked. Then in 2020 I learned my 3-min due diligence. 

It turned out that zero commission and fractional investing removed the bulk of the burden/reluctance/drudgery of due diligence.
-- fuxi: rbh recreational stock picking. my goal was to grow from 10k to 20k soon. Now my trading frequency is lower so I want to speed up the incremental pace.

I can top up on existing names or buy bigger chunks of new names. 
However, new names are usually less established, less proven

I can also allocate most of my new money to ETFs.

I can use limit orders on low-notional ETFs.

If I invest too much (like 9k) into ETFs, then I can pick a time. When I'm ready to buy a stock, I could liquidate some ETF.

I  hope to control tCost and cCost
This trend is more like creep than splurge

My long stay in Bayonne reassured myself that Bayonne is an acceptable location, esp. if I work in JC.
With a growing reserve, I can opt for a lower-paying job in JC, but there could be very good jobs in NYC.

Best choice for family is still living in JC and commuting to JC or NYC. 

Renting in JC is the default choice. flexibility

How did I get Tilray stock for free?
Probably a conversion due to M&A.
I assume it is a data error

After 55, we should leave cpf oa balance as is. It grows at 2.5%pa, better than bank deposits in return and liquidity.

any time after 55, I can incrementally withdraw most of my cpfOA to invest or spend.

-- new: first cash pile to invest: SRS^cpfOA^cash
Q: If I have extra cash to invest into stocks, should I invest cpfOA, or SRS or idle cash ?

SRS is the first fund to be invested.

idle cash is ranked in the middle.

cpfSA has 4% interest by default, so the opportunity cost_OF_investing is too high. cpfSA is the last fund to be invested.

It's crucial to be clear what exactly we want out of stock trading. Many valid priorities of other investors are not important to us. In fact, these OPPs (other people's priorities) may get in our way. 

* when you add those OPP, your life becomes more complicated, when it can be simpler like mine. You may have to babysit your positions. Your firewall is strained.
* when you add those OPP, they could displace some of your true priorities. Analog: carry-on luggage vs checked luggage.
* when you add those OPP, you may inadvertently take on more risks.

Matching SP500 return ... is a bad OPP
Investing 80% of my assets, and minimizing idle cash (make every dollar work hard) ... is an OPP

primary goal of exp recon is .. expense analysis
A minor goal is liquid NAV tracking. This goal doesn't require complicated system. Accuracy and reliability is extremely valuable. The expense recon provides exactly that quality assurance.

-- fuxi or new: most upgrading home buyers would max out their borrowing capacity
Delphia of oc is a mortgage specialist. She said majority of Singapore borrowers (probably including foreigners) would max out their loan quantum. One of the most important limits is TDSR. No more than 55% (was 60) of income (including CPF) is allowed to be used for installment. 55% of total income spent on debt servicing .. sounds like low ground. 

I asked her why "majority" has such a motivation. Delphia said many want to maximize their investment. (Delphia herself felt buying at the current price level doesn't sound like good investment.) It's leveraged investment at a very low borrowing cost.

Now I recall Wallace Xu said something similar about American home buyers... they are highly sensitive to rate hike.

buy-n-forget is not so easy with the bond mufu. The expRatio (0.5%?) erodes the low return. 
I may need to babysit my positions !

-- slow-cooking update livelihood blogs (S.Liu or Maslow)
[[Nomadland]] and many other movies and songs portray the livelihood pressures (even hardships) of ordinary people in relatively affluent locations (affluent as defined by global standard). For example, most Singaporeans would feel some livelihood pressure. 

For these individuals, my ezlife on the cash flow high ground is .. but a dream. 

I like mathematical criteria for that high ground, criteria like brbr, Fuller Wealth. By these criteria, my ezlife and my high ground are realistic for some of them, but they lack key incredients.

In my GEX course, I could see the livelihood pressure of many Singapore /nationals/ in their 40s, 50s and 60s

What units face risk of price drop? Wife said older flats. I say on-the-run. The better question is "will the price gap widen or narrow, over our holding window?"
