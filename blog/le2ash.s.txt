Hi Ashish,

Long letter, because I learned many things today. Reply to any point that catches your eyes.

Turning 50, I now notice a growing habit to self-identify with perceived declines commonly associated with aging. I actively self-identify with the sterotype, partly to protect my ego and self-esteem. This sterotype is a very broad brush that paints over and ignores huge individual differences. For a crude example, say we record at what age couples voluntarily reduce (full-strength) intercourse frequency to once a month. Some reach this threshold at 40, some at 70. The broad brush says it's 55 for all, so it is highly misleading. So what about my memory and coding test competence? As I said, the underlying, internal decline is actually small and slow at this stage but I routinely exaggerate it to explain various personal issues. It's a self-made lie told over and over. To recognize and expose it as a lie is painful and unpleasant, so I won't admit it as such.

To be brutally honest with myself, here are some self-descriptions (hopefully unbiased) relative to you and others I count as my peers.

* diet habit, workout .. excellent self-disciplilne; good condition for my age, albeit declining
* cashflow high ground .. good non-work income; satisfactory total income; excellent burn rate, though rising :(
* self-renewal in tech skills .. brushed aside
* lagging behind the curve? Perhaps. As I told you, I seldom notice a new technology worth learning. CoreJava, c++, sockets, memory management, threading ... are old technologies with decades of history.
* in-demand? not really. My skillset and age profile is less and less attractive to employers esp. in Singapore.
* salary .. Contentment is a virtue. I refuse to benchmark myself by researching other people. (I do talk informally about salary ranges in vastly different roles, uncomparable to my role.)
* job security .. better than previous jobs. Therefore, low motivation to keep up "body-building" for interviews

Re realloc(), I found a blogpost I wrote on realloc a few years ago. I thought blogging would help to reinfoce learning. But today I didn't remember anything about realloc. Before the next c++ tech interview, I would review my 1000 ~ 2000 blogposts on c++/performance/memory/linux/socket/... and rebuild the "memory graph" in my mind. When quizzed on a topic, I would then "traverse" my graph in real time, and find relevant details to impress the interviewer and survive the competition. If that interview is 2030, then I should review in 2029, not now. (Obviously when I review my own blog, I would also read other content.)

To a lesser extent, I will also experiment with my 50~100 c++ programs in my github account. I wrote some of them to explore certain c++ topics. These experiments are probably similar to yours, so I think you would say they are good for learning.

Looking back, I think I score higher, and forget slower in theoretical topics like bigO, data structures, probability and number theory puzzles.
