job choices in the U.S. -- stress vs employee benefits

Our discussion brought into focus an interesting choice involving medical benefits vs work stress, among other things.... Somehow salary is outside my focus. Even after our call, my default choice for "what if I lose my current job" remains unchanged 
•	I will quickly start job hunting in the U.S., both contract and perm. See which search is faster. Suppose I get a contract offer.
•	I will negotiate for USD 150-200k before the agency takes a cut. After the cut, I may get 130k. After-tax, I may get around 100k.
•	I will need to shop for decent insurance just for myself. Perhaps 10k/Y? I don't mind high deductible/coinsurance but I need major procedures and medications covered.
•	medications .. I will bring enough supplies with me to last a year.
•	flights back to Singapore -- I will need to schedule my periodic checks in Singapore if cheaper. I will need to consider business-class flights to reduce stress on my heart. 
•	.. Due to the cost, I will reduce the frequency of those flights to 3/year. Hopefully, that's enough reunion frequency for the family  
•	main benefit of contract jobs -- lower work stress, lower expectation

Now I feel I may need to accept moderately higher work stress. Life is full of stress anyway. I want to be confident about my health and my capacity to handle stress. In a perm role, work stress is higher but healthcare-related "stress" will be lower.
