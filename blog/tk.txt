-- nice surprises

-- well done
mlphone proved valuable, though with 99% SLA. I need it to call China, Singapore ..
spare charging cables + adapters proved useful.
conservation of plastic
I motivated myself to exercise every single day
kept weight to 65.5kg
avoided fried food 
minimal creamy food
lots of quiet time, far better than Korean trip

-- thank god
Meimei was nice to me, cooperative with everyone
no injury
no loss

-- reflections
I need quiet time and adequate rest
I want control on costs
I don't want to feel regret (as in Seoul) for time wasted in "meaningless places". I would rather stay in hotel and read and blog
I don't mind missing "memorable" sight seeing and good foods, but I want my famiy to have a good rmSelf experience
