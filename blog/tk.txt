-- udate post on mlphone hotspot
Issue: NoSim. I had to connect to a wifi to set up SIM
Issue: other devices can't detect this SSID. I had to disable-then-enable it on mlphone

Once another device connects to this SSID, mlphone shows a green banner on top.

mlphone proved valuable, though less than reliable
hotel wifi excellent
