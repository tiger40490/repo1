-- nice surprises
3 of them are self-reliant and competent
boy is not nasty to mom and meimei
healthy food is easy to find
I established a base plan -- stay in hotel throughout [good wifi, 24h English-speaking staff]. I even validated it with Genn and wife.

-- well done
mlphone proved valuable, though with 99% SLA. I need it to call China, Singapore ..
spare charging cables + adapters proved useful.

-- reflections
I need quiet time and adequate rest
I want control on costs
I don't want to feel regret (as in Seoul) for time wasted in "meaningless places". I would rather stay in hotel and read and blog
I don't mind missing "memorable" sight seeing and good foods, but I want my famiy to have a good rmSelf experience
