-- udate post on mlphone hotspot
Issue: NoSim. I had to connect to a wifi to set up SIM
Issue: other devices can't detect this SSID. I had to disable-then-enable it on mlphone

Once another device connects to this SSID, mlphone shows a green banner on top.

jogging in a park?

mlphone proved valuable, though with 99% SLA
spare charging cables + adapters are useful.

I need quiet time and adequate rest
I want control on costs
I don't want to feel regret (as in Seoul) for time wasted in "meaningless places"
I don't mind missing "memorable" sight seeing and good foods, but I want my famiy to have a good rmSelf experience
