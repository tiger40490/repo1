-- stressor profile returning from Jap 
minor stressor: medical appointments .. nothing urgent actually
plate_pff .. numerous /tasks/ here n there, but well "within my zone"
-plate: parenting... meimei not so bad
.. meimei math .. not enough motivation, but she does cooperate most of the time.
plate_gz: work projects .. low-stress overall. Boss relationship improved. Still, I need to go to work every day .. commitment
+plate_wellness
.. gooood: intimacy, though insufficient frequency 
.. gooood: 5/wk though not so ""fully-charged"
.. good: diet self-control
.. good: sleep easy
.. meimei's teeth
.. boy's skin

Lots of peers have major stressors (fault lines) in plate_gz, plate_pff, plate_wellness, marriage,,,,

-- well done
mlphone proved valuable, though with 99% SLA. I need it to call China, Singapore ..
spare charging cables + adapters proved useful.
conservation of plastic
PSBC::GP .. I made all the efforts to make use of it

adequate sleep, despite multiple challenges
I motivated myself to exercise every single day
kept weight to 65.5kg
avoided fried food 
minimal creamy food
lots of quiet time, far better than Korean trip
medications .. taken daily without fail

-- nice surprises
Meimei was nice to me throughout, cooperative with everyone. She helped me calm down and restrain myself at critical moments.
PSBC::GP .. worked in Japan!
eye drop reimbursed

-- thank god
no injury
no loss
After returning to Sg, I found my erection in good condition .. not to be taken for granted. I need intimacy as stress relief

-- reflections
I want control on costs
I don't want to feel regret (as in Seoul) for time wasted in "meaningless places". I would rather stay in hotel and read and blog
I don't mind missing "memorable" sight seeing and good foods, but I want my famiy to have a good rmSelf experience
