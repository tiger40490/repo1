-- nice surprises

-- well done
mlphone proved valuable, though with 99% SLA. I need it to call China, Singapore ..
spare charging cables + adapters proved useful.

-- reflections
I need quiet time and adequate rest
I want control on costs
I don't want to feel regret (as in Seoul) for time wasted in "meaningless places". I would rather stay in hotel and read and blog
I don't mind missing "memorable" sight seeing and good foods, but I want my famiy to have a good rmSelf experience
