For some people, smoke/alcohol are essential to quality of life. For me, that includes intimacy, workout, fruits, cakes, chocolates.

For mom, mobility,,,

Losing these freedoms or cutting back on these joys really cut deep.

-- new: CAD implications
If I go to the U.S. I will need insurance. I will need frequent medical checks and consultations. WStC jobs will be less attractive given the expensive insurance.

A PSA/OC type of lower-stress dev job will become increasingly suitable for me. I maintain a decent effort with good attitude, and they will keep my job.

I will need to get my kids to take over my rental properties.

I will scale back on long-term risky investments, and allocate more towards stable assets just like retirees do.

Once a while I envy those in my cohort who are free of "my problems". For years, I used to feel superior, lucky, one of the God's favored children because I did good deeds and took care of my body for so long. Now I feel unlucky.

A classmate was suspected for some tumor (I won't elaborate) and decided to google life expectancy for such patients. I refuse to do so. My new longevity target will become ... 85?

For about 10 years I felt like immortal whenever I tell people that I plan to live till 95. Many long-term plans were made based on that optimism.

I tend to look at my running performance as a guage of my physical decline, but now I think denial of the natural decline can be harmful. No-decline is a good sign if it is natural and managed safely, not propped up artificially.

I hope to regain my sense of optimism and gratitude.

I hope to find something good in this challenging situation. I may not find any.

Q: competitive running/jogging .. fall at the end? Yes dangerous to the heart. Immediate medical attention required.
AA: Aim at endurance and don't sprint. Maintain pace. 
%%A: My younger-day habit of all-out sprint in the last lap is no longer safe at my age

-- fuxi: BMI is no longer the primary, dominant control factor for my wellness. 
As my health declines, CAD, gastritis, blood sugar are bigger risk factors
