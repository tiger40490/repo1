Am grieving the freedom to exercise any way I want.

However, I was never able to do skating. Strech exercise ... never "grief"

Q: what's my biggest grief after the CAD diagnosis?
A: the comfortable choice of a WStC "parachute"

diet freedom .. might be top 3, but I started my "grieving" 10+ years ago due to cholesterol.

Not really longevity. Not my chance to stay with my kids till they grow to middle-age.

With Yuyun, I explored the other traumatic/disabling diseases. Each one can cause grief.
* EDyw
* diabetes .. grief over diet freedom
* mobility .. grandpa

~~ grief over 100% of ALL sweet foods
I told Huimei ..

However, when Dr Leow warned about the very high risk of diabetes, I had a sinking feeling -- I would need to cut back
* cakes
* chocolates
* many fruits except a few

Perhaps this is a jolt, a nudge to adopt more healthy diet habit.

Am grieving the loss of freedom to sleep late, but over the years, I often notice that morning noise is bad for my sleep.

Perhaps this is a jolt, and a nudge to improve my sleep higiene

-- new: CAD implications
If I go to the U.S. I will need insurance. I will need frequent medical checks and consultations. WStC jobs will be less attractive given the expensive insurance.

A PSA/OC type of lower-stress dev job will become increasingly suitable for me. I maintain a decent effort with good attitude, and they will keep my job.

I will need to get my kids to take over my rental properties.

I will scale back on long-term risky investments, and allocate more towards stable assets just like retirees do.

Once a while I envy those in my cohort who are free of "my problems". For years, I used to feel superior, lucky, one of the God's favored children because I did good deeds and took care of my body for so long. Now I feel unlucky.

A classmate was suspected for some tumor (I won't elaborate) and decided to google life expectancy for such patients. I refuse to do so. My new longevity target will become ... 85?

For about 10 years I felt like immortal whenever I tell people that I plan to live till 95. Many long-term plans were made based on that optimism.

I hope to regain my sense of optimism and gratitude.

I hope to find something good in this challenging situation. I may not find any.

food .. nuts, cakes .. reduce not eliminate

blood thinning : after meal? 

Q: What if I miss 1 or 2 times a week?
AA: don't double up on the next day

Q: how do I know that work stress is actually affecting my heart health?
AA: chest tightness, short of breath while climbing even a short stair
Q: how about mild discomfort around the heart
AA: yes can be a sign

Q: competitive running/jogging .. fall at the end? Yes dangerous to the heart. Immediate medical attention required.
AA: Aim at endurance and don't sprint. Maintain pace. 
%%A: My younger-day habit of all-out sprint in the last lap is no longer safe at my age

I tend to look at my running performance as a guage of my physical decline, but now I think denial of the natural decline can be harmful. No-decline is a good sign if it is natural and managed safely, not propped up artificially.

-- fuxi: BMI is no longer the primary, dominent control factor. 
As my health declines, CAD, gastritis, blood sugar are bigger risk factors
