Decades ago, many ordinary workers would spend many hour commuting by foot. They have to. 
You may feel pity for them.
But that's not a medical condition. 

-- update bpost on longevity https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=48298&action=edit
In Dec 2023 I started to worry about quality_of_life in my mom's twilight years, either in a Beijing nursing home, or a Singapore nursing home, or living with my wife (while I'm away in the U.S.), against the backdrop of her declining health.

quality_of_life is another side of VV (one of the trio).

All the scenarios appear pathetic, unappealing, scary,,, As people grow old, they are bound to experience (some or all of) mobility decline, mental decline, living away from immediate family, or outside their own comfortable home. Inevitable for many in their 80s and beyond. 

Given an elderly's health, financial and family situation, his choices are often limited. If money is not the problem (willing suspension of disbelief), then perhaps he can live with family + adequate healthcare at home [R.Teo's dad?]. Hopefully (big hope), the in-law caregivers are able to cope, supported by plenty of external resources. This "acceptable" bar is too high to be realistic.

Before I can plan ahead, I have to give up on unrealistic expectations.

How about my ADL insurance? I now feel somewhat more vindicated. 

The more children and grandchildren I have, the more resources I have available in my old age.

AA: Even aspirin can be safe, if taken after (within 15m or with) meal

May need more effective cholesterol drug. 
How do I watch out for liver damage due to Lipitor? 
AA: blood test every 6M

Is my blood pressure likely to rise? 
AA: yes but only due to aging, not the procedure

will the procedure leave the smaller plagues (below 50% blockage) untreated? Will they build up? Improvement is impossible.
AA: Scenario 1: doesn't build up over many years
AA: Sceanrio 2: worsening.. further intervention

I requested for treadmill every 6M.

How safe is chin-up, or push-up, skip-rope etc? AA: Wait for 1M .. wrist wound
How safe is climbing stairs and squat? AA: yes after 2 weeks
How safe is slow run up a small hill? AA: safe
How safe is 100m continuous swim? AA: safe
Most people need 30min of aerobic exercise 5 times a week... How aobut me? AA: same for me

grapefruit juice can interfere with statin but grape juice is safe

What causes do you see? 
AA: genetics + aging

For young men with family history, start checking cholesterol after 20.

Is atherectomy a safe option for me?
AA: higher risk. Good option when it's necessary (lesser of two evils) such as hardened plaque. 

one or more stents?

Q: test for insulin in blood in addition to hbA1c, to guage my risk of diabetes?
A: no need

Q: EDyw since early 2023 .. could it be due to my plaque build-up?

A: may not be zero 3Y ago.

Q8b: Will it continue at a slower pace if I take these medications? A: Yes!
Q8c: But slower pace still implies I may need stenting in a few years?
