-- questions for cardiologist
Do I need to learn to recognize angina and prepare a GTN?
A: there are many angina symptoms including some minor discomfort
A: GTN not effective for me. Tablets like aspirin blood thinner also unsuitable since it can backfire in some cases
%%A: I believe GTN and tablets are not needed for my current level of risk. For some reason, doctor won't put it that way.

Is my sildenafil affected by the three drugs you prescribed? 
A: No. 
A: GTN + sildenafil would be dangerous

Q: future CT results will need to be interpreted with this FFR report?
A: regular CT will not be suitable.. wait for newer technology

Q: how do I monitor the build-up over next 10y?
A: ESE (exercise stress echo) every 2Y, or 1Y at least
A: regular treadmill test will give false positives.

What can I do about hypertension risk? I guess same as everyone else i.e. manage risk facctors

Q: In early Apr, you told me my risk of heart attack is quite high so I need an angioplasty within a month. Is my risk profile improved so much that I I don't need to constantly worry about heart attack?
A: After the angiogram, my risk of heart attack is below 1% within 1-2Y. Blockage is at most 50% despite what he wrote in the discharge summary.

test for insulin in blood in addition to hbA1c, to guage my risk of diabetes?
A: no need

EDyw since early 2023 .. could it be due to my plaque build-up?
A: possible, but any man above 45 has increased risk.

Was my progression so fast over 3 years? from zero to 50%? 
A: may not be zero 3Y ago.

Will it continue at a slower pace if I take these medications? Yes!
But slower pace still implies I may need stenting in a few years?
A: possible. All depend on on periodic ESE results

chest strap memo
A: aim below 90% of 170 bps

.. can I train for JPM5600 2025? yes

CoQ10 .. good for me if my mom asks me to try?

-- update bpost on grieving
Decades ago, many ordinary workers would spend many hour commuting by foot. They have to. 
You may feel pity for them.
But that's not a medical condition. 

-- fuxi: why I envy those JPM5600 runners?
I shared with Jason. Subconsciously, I am relying on my performance number to prove to myself (and others) that I'm able to defy aging, and my body's overall fitness is comparable to those 30+. 

CAD revelation is a stark indication of aging of my heart arteries. ( My heart and other organ are still young and bealthy. ) I find it hard to accept that aging has taken place so fast.

The JPM5600 will not be a usable proof going forward.

In terms of my body flexibility, EDyw, energy level, eyesight, speed coding,,, I have noticed aging signs for years. What's different this time round? Well, CAD has a host of lifelong implications. I'm grieving my losses more than EDyw or earlier.

-- update bpost on longevity https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=48298&action=edit
In Dec 2023 I started to worry about quality_of_life in my mom's twilight years, either in a Beijing nursing home, or a Singapore nursing home, or living with my wife (while I'm away in the U.S.), against the backdrop of her declining health.

quality_of_life is another side of VV (one of the trio).

All the scenarios appear pathetic, unappealing, scary,,, As people grow old, they are bound to experience (some or all of) mobility decline, mental decline, living away from immediate family, or outside their own comfortable home. Inevitable for many in their 80s and beyond. 

Given an elderly's health, financial and family situation, his choices are often limited. If money is not the problem (willing suspension of disbelief), then perhaps he can live with family + adequate healthcare at home [R.Teo's dad?]. Hopefully (big hope), the in-law caregivers are able to cope, supported by plenty of external resources. This "acceptable" bar is too high to be realistic.

Before I can plan ahead, I have to give up on unrealistic expectations.

How about my ADL insurance? I now feel somewhat more vindicated. 

The more children and grandchildren I have, the more resources I have available in my old age.

-- new: CAD implications
If I go to the U.S. I will need insurance. I will need frequent medical checks and consultations. WStC jobs will be less attractive given the expensive insurance.

A PSA/OC type of lower-stress dev job will become increasingly suitable for me. I maintain a decent effort with good attitude, and they will keep my job.

I will need to get my kids to take over my rental properties.

I will scale back on long-term risky investments, and allocate more towards stable assets just like retirees do.

Once a while I envy those in my cohort who are free of "my problems". For years, I used to feel superior, lucky, one of the God's favored children because I did good deeds and took care of my body for so long. Now I feel unlucky.

A classmate was suspected for some tumor (I won't elaborate) and decided to google life expectancy for such patients. I refuse to do so. My new longevity target will become ... 85?

For about 10 years I felt like immortal whenever I tell people that I plan to live till 95. Many long-term plans were made based on that optimism.

I tend to look at my running performance as a guage of my physical decline, but now I think denial of the natural decline can be harmful. No-decline is a good sign if it is natural and managed safely, not propped up artificially.

I hope to regain my sense of optimism and gratitude.

I hope to find something good in this challenging situation. I may not find any.

I have gastritis ... so some blood thinners are unsafe? 
AA: Even aspirin can be safe, if taken after (within 15m or with) meal

May need more effective cholesterol drug. 
How do I watch out for liver damage due to Lipitor? 
AA: blood test every 6M

Is my blood pressure likely to rise? 
AA: yes but only due to aging, not the procedure

will the procedure leave the smaller plagues (below 50% blockage) untreated? Will they build up? Improvement is impossible.
AA: Scenario 1: doesn't build up over many years
AA: Sceanrio 2: worsening.. further intervention

I requested for treadmill every 6M.

How safe is chin-up, or push-up, skip-rope etc? AA: Wait for 1M .. wrist wound
How safe is climbing stairs and squat? AA: yes after 2 weeks
How safe is slow run up a small hill? AA: safe
How safe is 100m continuous swim? AA: safe

Is atherectomy a safe option for me?
AA: higher risk. Good option when it's necessary (lesser of two evils) such as hardened plaque.
