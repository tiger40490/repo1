I sometimes feel sad to observe that in his iPhone, Yixin has marked my mobile number as a blocked caller so his phone doesn't ring when I call... has lasted at least 2 months. Even if not "blocked", he has not answered my call or messages for at least 4 months. (He does answer Mom's call.) He probably doesn't feel a need to answer any phone call from me, because has has little respect for me.

He has even less respect for Mom. 

shower .. Yixin refused to shower for 45 days. ...

mom's cooking... Mom always cooks for him but since Oct 2024 he seldom eats mom's cooking. He doesn't inform mom "Hey Mom, I'm not eating home lunch." and is never apologetic. 

A stronger evidence of disrespect lies in his pattern of behavior after we agree to rendezvous somewhere for a family outing. For the past 6 months, he would invariably make Mom (+ sister sometimes) wait for 30 to 60 minutes, nine out of ten times.

I told my wife that both of us were treated as servants by Yixi. My wife has started to use the same phrase.

For Mom and Dad, every attempt to discipline, control or punish him has failed. If Mom doesn't cook for him (because he has repeatedly refused to eat her cooking), he would accuse Mom of starving him. If I take away his phone, he would refuse to study anything at all, or threaten to run away from home, or join the street gangs. I also told him "After 18, you need to earn a living for yourself. I won't be a servant and ATM for you, while you treat me like dirt", but he doesn't care. If I find him uncooperative/disrespectful and decide not to go out with him for cycling, he would know that he has little to lose, but I have a lot to lose -- I need those cycling trips to maintain the father-son bond.
