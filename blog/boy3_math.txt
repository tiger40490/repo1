--%%renzi regime ^ Raymond's approach
infinite patience infinite time.  Accept low commitment accept short attention span accept give-up attitude (Mrs Goh's observation).

I think Sakamoto teacher is similar.

See my blogpost on renzi. In hindsight, I feel the hours (actually months) spent on his renzi was too high.

If you plant a cucumber and it doesn't grow well, would you blame the cucumber?

--word-problem coaching is one of the toughest face times. 
Confrontational, most (80%) of the time
confrontational face time is usually ineffective, because he drags his feet and refuses to put in effort... losing my cool

In contrast, face time based on my worksheet is slightly more effective face time.
baby-sitting is a passive face time

Q: why did grandma give up coaching him on wordy problem? Is it feet-dragging?

I advocated for a long time to stop tuitions!

I feel his motivation for wordy problems is too low. We could pay a tutor and I can (avoid) take time off from work but he might still waste time.

I feel what he needs is not academic help, but a ton of encouragement and some control 温和的坚持. Consider my yoga experience.

My dismal ROTI is a real pain and negative feedback.

--Ask boy "How do your classmates study?"


--jolt: apparently, only one student in his class is comfortable with the wordy problems.

Sounds like everyone else is afraid and anxious about wordy problems.

This says a lot about the quality and effectiveness of this education

I decided in NY to come home and reduce boy's math workload -- saturation, eroding confidence/interest..
The "perseverance" slogan is directly against my plan.

My first-hand experience shows that he has forgotten many recent problems he solved.  We don't need more problems; we need re-practice.
