Yesterday I got off light rail and got down to the tracks hoping to climb over a fence as a shortcut. A policeman yelled at me to stop. I stopped climbing and walked along the track towards the main exit at south end of track. Policeman shouted again, instructing me to come back up to platform. At that moment I was somewhere half way between the two ends of the fence separating platform from tracks. From my position on the track, I looked both ways and compared my options.

Walking forward to the south end was faster than turning back north and climbing up the platform (no stairs). The south end had no train that day, so if a train were to come onto me it would be from behind. Walking forward I have more time to escape. If I were to turn back, climb the platform, and fall on the track while climbing, the oncoming train would hit me.

I walked forward to the exit, and waited for the policeman. He charged me with defiant trespass.

Police officer said I ignored his instruction. I didnâ€™t as I knew he would not let me get away. What appeared as defiance was a decision to get out of a dangerous place ASAP.

Q: Can I plea not guilty?
