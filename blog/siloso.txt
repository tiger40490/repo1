Somehow, I don't feel /recharged/ during Siloso or (as I told colleagues) PEK May vacations. What would make me feel ..
relaxed? reading, learning, chitchat
recharged? workout? 

-- priorities for myself + family
daily pills
daily workout .. can swim or jog. Not so important. LGlp
personal quiet time .. tough in this small room with limited storage space
enough sleep, early sleep .. tough LGlp. I'm able to get _some_ sleep
delicious meals .. LGlp. basic healthy is good for me
save cost .. LG-no-guilt

-- well done.. twisters
spent lots of time with meimei (boy too) in pool, even though she didn't really practice swimming
Had some tense moments with each kid. I managed to reconcile with each

I was able to find a quiet space in corridor.. facing bubbling water, fish
eco .. reusing towels
good try .. late night movie. I was able to find anywheel to come home after movie

-- thank God... twisters
Even though I came to office around 10am, I was able to leave early as planned. Had precioius 1 hour on beach before sunset
.. had a low-stress day in office
Even though there was light rail suspension, we were able to reach Vivo by 9.20pm
Hotel kindly provided extra chairs + hangers + charger + extra key
3-head charging cable worked fine
