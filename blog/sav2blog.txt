----no blogpost: strict control relaxed but not all lost
a reduction in austerity is quite common with everyone. It doesn't mean collapose and relapse ..
--sleep
i am now able to reduce sleep :)
early rise -- i am now getting up earlier than most of the day in my adult life
--diet
I did eat chocolates, but only when under high stress, and not huge quantity
I avoided hash browns even when everyone in the team had it
I'm still very very strict on starch and oil. Tough but see my strength shining through
fruits + veg -- still dominates my diet. 
protein powder -- 
--workout
yoga -- I did a lot on flight. Also did some at home 
push-up
chin-up -- important thing is the effort. I continue to put in some effort working on consistency of effort
bike to work -- 
standing desk -- i'm keeping it up in office AND home

--no blogpost: lesson learnt on this flight
15H flight is tolerable on my body though shorter would be less taxing
4H sleep before 15H was insufficient to keep me awake. I felt extremely sleepy some hours after take-off
I didn't try the wine and felt OK. I was too busy on my laptop and simply followed my early decision to take tomato juice ... wise :)
diet? not so strict but reasnonablly good. Removed fried content:)

movie-abstinence -- I did it twice in a row but it may become tough. This time I had plenty of motivation to read java, [[pearls]].

no need to feel guilty about coding drill. The less guilt the better for my system. The guilt is completely counterproductive and unfair

I conceived many worthwhile thoughts about career, parenting, .. High Fertility flight

I relied heavily on laptop but perhaps phone+fake finger might be more convenient -- easier to charge, less bulky. 
However for lengthy writing, laptop wins

--new blogpost: highRiskHighReturn #Jill
AsiaPropertyDev has  current campaignn to pay 20% in Y1, 21% in Y2 ... 24% in Y5 if client commits 50k. Last payment is 50k * 1.24.

I told Jill this contractual return is too high and a sign of desperation but Jill said CEO adjusts campaign features constantly.

I shared with Jill my observation -- once a while a reputble company disrupts a mature market with drastically reduced cost to customers and captures huge market share

Q: given a random string of bracket openers/closers, write a bool function to determine if it's balanced

--new blogpost: 45-min commute when living with/out family
After my son was born in NY, my 50-minute commute (Hamilton) vs 35-min commute (Newport) felt very differnt
1-hr commute feels OK at mvea because ... no family and low workload
living with family, i predict i would again feel a big difference of 15 min change in commute

Many people feel such a prediction is highly unreliable, but I feel past experience is very reliable

staying with family, I get basically no time for study and very limited time for blogging.. about 5hr/week but I need 20-40 hr/week !!

--healthy diet tips given by SG HPB #orange
recommended -- sugar substitutes; sugar-free drinks; Chinese tea
orange is safe even though not leanest. Orange is not as low-cal as some veg but Singapore HPB (and many experts would agree) picked orange as the safest food.
