--no blogpost: my current struggles #tectonic:
* boy's math? Is it my job or his job? If I don't take ownership then the pressure is off
* [t] calorie count? I feel the Singapore climate adds 5 kg, even if my starch intake is halved 3 times
* yoga? now easier once I paid the membership fee :)
* figure-out-speed ] localSys
* [t] CIV? LG2. How about review or simple problems?
* [t=tough struggle]

-- sometimes the review of weekend hour utilization is counter-productive. Everyone's weekend is mostly "rot" not burn, including my role models. In fact those who "achieve" more than 3 hours of burning each weekend are probably fictional characters or doing something bad to their body and mind.

Probably they are focusing on something not so strategic or high-leverage, by my standard.

Steven Keith .. I really don't know what he does. I'm working with a whole theory based on just one sentence of anecdotal account.

Grandpa .. is a 1000 times more real as a role model but his wekends are not all burning.

Anyway, a fixation on burn/rot, leverage etc is mostly counterproductive

--new? finer things in life
(This kind of blogpost is best done in git-blogging :)
The consumerism has hijacked this phrase, but to me, most finer things in life are free or easily available to the lower-income families, such as
* fruits, raw or cooked vegetables
* parks
* trips to natural scenes
* swimming pool. 
* Jogging in the park is free, but I prefer a proper stadium.

--new? start discarding old stuff for emigration
Good to start discarding things early to spread out the mental load
* electronics
* books

--new?
intelligence, memory capacity, clear thinking, sharp perception ... can help the individual deal with depression and pessimism. I think most pessimistic thoughts are irrational and/or biased.

"Explanatory style" .. see [[learned optimism]]

"Mindfulness" is a therapy. This therapy can even cope with brain aging.

Memory is a muscle.. I think corrective thinking like my twister SMS is also a muscle one can improve by everyday training.

--no blog: unbroken.. a few nice items

--new? stress profile 2 Sep
Stressor #1 new job ramp up during first month
stressor #2 BGC payment
stressor #3 satisfying sex. Not a destressor ... why? I seem to take it as a basic need but many people don't have it and still feel OK
stressor: insufficient outgoing minutes... cost overrun.. consider buying more minutes just to contain the stress
stressor: data overusage. I added mobile data limit
stressor: phone + laptop battery draining
stressor: watch battery. I chose the reliable service shop
stressor: the HY exposure is still too high.
[*] destressor: blogging as a tool for focus, clarification, zoom-in
destressor/declutter: cancelled Everyday ccard
destressor/declutter: cancelled multiple oc accounts
destressor: converted USD 5k, as 5k at home is a stressor
destressor: postpone SGD expense tracking
destressor: math -- postpone everything. Let it be
stressor: unpacking. luckily I did most of it on 2 Sep
[*] destressor: early sleep
destressor: short commute, with git-blogging
stressor: ikea lamp: luckily i used it enough times. Accept that we have lost that part.
stressor: boy's math .. attitude, habit, effort, 

[*=effective]

--consider working in BJ home for a week in Sep 2020

--nothing new: Over the 2019 final days in the U.S. i felt very lucky
* surprise improvement -- C++ critical mass while coreJava remains a competency
* surprise improvement -- CIV is now becoming my 2nd competitive advantage after QQ
* [unbroken] health + vitality 
* [unbroken] marriage
* new plan of dev-till-70
* surprise improvement -- most young talents shun the contract job market, for fundamental reasons, leaving the field wide open to me.
* surprise improvement (tentative) -- startup and web2.0 shops are emerging as new frontiers, beside ibanks. Remember the c#/quant/swing adventures
* surprise improvement (short term) -- contract rate slowly rising

With my marketable skills + health, in the U.S. everything will work out in my personal life, 
* even though U.S. convenience level is low
* even though U.S. commute is much worse than SG. Some WFH will help.
* even though my kids may not become top students
* even though my wife may not find meaningful job

Rahul put his heart into the job. I think my sister does that too.
My son might as well. I need to appreciate that.
I put my heart into theoretical learning, which I want to show my son 

--fuxi done 
enjoying the airport lounge food, I feel my kids would feel .... privileged?
But I don't want them to feel inferior when they don't have it. So perhaps the feeling of privilege is a double-edged sword, to be managed.

Perhaps we can't remove the sense of privilege or inferiority/deprivation

--fuxi x 3
perhaps I have an adjustment problem with negative feedback. 
The problem is my reaction to the feedback. 
I feel my sister and my son may be more effective. 

I feel I can do better. I can learn coping strategies. 
I can relax as grandpa suggested. 
I can learn to live in peace with the negative feedback. 
If I put in a reasonable effort and manager accepts it without a bonus, then I feel I can be happy. 
If I put in a reasonable effort but manager clearly indicates "unacceptable", then I feel i would take action to leave

Overall, my reaction to PIP is weaker than my reaction to IV setbacks. 
Traditionally, one of my strengths is positive attitude to IV setbacks. 
It is easy to look at the gap and feel hopeless.

Parenting also requires this capacity. [[Learned optimism]]] listed Permanent as one hallmark of pessimists.

The honeymoon of engagement (on coding drill, localSys, GTD, emailing to friends ..) is joy and pleasure in itself.
eg@engage: morning quiet time... the zone
eg@engage: on flights
eg@engage: weekend assignments

--intrinsic mtv is rather rare in most commercial domains
Arts (including fine arts..) are more likely. Personalized service (like nursing, counseling) also possible

--fuxi:
After reading A.Brooks, I assumed that grandpa's health would suffer if he loses relevance after retirement. 

He is very sure it won't happen. He said people in his circle basically keep working until physically unable. He foresees his life to be really busy for a few more years until his health prevents him from working. 

He actually believe his active workload at age 84 is harming his health. I feel irrelevance would be more detrimental to his health, but perhaps he has never thought of irrelevance.

--fuxi: I feel Indians have a problem with slim. I feel their culture associates slim with something negative, perhaps poverty?
In Chinese culture, I can see that BMI 19 is considered unattractive.
In reality, thinning is healthy for most people.

Likewise, I'm brainwashed to worship brank and overvalue work place interpersonal skills. I'm not good at them but I have something better -- ffree and easy-life (as QiChongLei puts it).
