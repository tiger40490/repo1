When in sky-high absorbency, I should try and take on the really tough. When in "good" absorbency, I should take on the medium tough jobs.

Compare to my peers, I have superior Long-term absorbency on these specific challenges:
* jogging, but not stretching
* push-up but not chin-up
* QQ study but not coding drill -- major competition
* eating raw veg but not celery

These long-term absorbency advantages are life-enhancing (too put it mildly)

--new: the more carefully I prepare something, the higher my risk of disappointment
* eg: prepare math worksheet for boy
* eg: wife or mom prepares a meal for me
* eg: quant study
* eg: many weekends bring boy out and study renzi

-- my deep (vague) disappointment with my renzi effort was largely due to the worldly, materialistic "progress". 

No progress, then i feel time wasted. That's materialistic and impatience.

--new: accept minor accidental losses
eg: accidental data usage -- waipo, grandma and me all did that with singtel prepaid card. It's a trap!
eg: starhub tv remote control : paying channel by accident
eg: smrt card penalty
eg: retro fitness fee

Why i experience so much pain? I think I can learn to relax and accept just as I have accepted many things in my life

--biggest problem with singtel prepaid card: accidental data usage
how do I block it permanently?

As soon as I buy a new card or refill card, I should disable internet

--email to Miles: why I have a warm feeling for New York City
After hearing your first impression of NYC, I decided to take this opportunity to reflect why I have a warm feeling for the big apple.

Many Americans tell me NYC is full of energy.  There are many young people, and many events. They make me feel lively, not lonely. I certainly wish to see more Chinese faces. Luckily, some of those young people (and older guys) attracted to New  York City are actually Chinese. The three Chinatowns in NYC (Manhattan Chinatown, Flushing and eighth avenue) make me feel less isolated than in other U.S. cities.  Jersey City also has a large Chinese population, much higher than an average U.S. city.

NYC is more diverse, and less white.

Incomes are slightly higher in NYC than other U.S. cities. I feel lucky for that. Even though prices are also higher, I donâ€™t usually buy anything in Manhattan. As a result, I get to save more in NYC than other cities. 

NYC offers more diverse job choices and education choices. Makes me feel less boxed in less restricted and more free.

My family income is not high. Many "nicer" locations of U.S. are higher income. I actually feel poor in those locations when my neighbors all earn higher. NYC has many poor residents, and make me not so left out.
