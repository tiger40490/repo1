* [t] calorie count? I feel the Singapore climate adds 5 kg, even if my starch intake is halved 3 times
* yoga? now easier once I paid the membership fee :)
* figure-out-speed ] localSys
* [t?] CIV? LG2. How about review or simple problems?

--new?
intelligence, memory capacity, clear thinking, sharp perception ... can help the individual deal with depression and pessimism. I think most pessimistic thoughts are irrational and/or biased.

"Explanatory style" .. see [[learned optimism]]

"Mindfulness" is a therapy. This therapy can even cope with brain aging.

Memory is a muscle.. I think corrective thinking like my twister SMS is also a muscle one can improve by everyday training.

--new? stress profile 2 Sep
Stressor #1 new job ramp up during first month. First month passed with 80% effort. Some visible progress, but a lot more invisible progress.
stressor #2 BGC payment
stressor #3 satisfying sex. Not a destressor ... why? I seem to take it as a basic need but many people don't have it and still feel OK
stressor: I took on the challenge to meet Ms Goh and address boy's math challenge. Stress is largely due to choices 
[*] destressor: blogging as a tool for focus, clarification, zoom-in
destressor: short commute, with git-blogging. I don't feel part of my precious spare time is "eroded" by commute
[*] destressor: early sleep
stressor: diet and weight? but I started on a new diet under very challenging conditions.
stressor: yoga discontinued ... but I paid for a membership and created a powerful commitment .. highly effective
destressor/declutter: cancelled Everyday ccard; cancelled multiple oc accounts
[*] destressor: SGD expense tracking provided clarity and reassurance
destressor: the HY exposure reduced
destressor: converted USD 5k, as 5k at home is a stressor
stressor: unpacking. luckily I did most of it on 2 Sep
stressor: ikea lamp: luckily i used it enough times. Accept that we have lost that part.
stressor: insufficient outgoing minutes... cost overrun.. consider buying more minutes just to contain the stress
stressor: data overusage. I added mobile data limit
