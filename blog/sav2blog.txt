* eg: high fruit/veg low fat/starch diet .. to protect against stress binge
* eg: plenty of spare time, rather than fully stretched .. to protect against spare time depletion
* eg: wife able to make a living
* eg: passive incomes
* eg: c++ in addition to java to provide livelihood
* eg: many low-cost laptops

many random adversities to fall on us throughout our everyday lives. 
Each individual is better at handling some categories of adversities. 
Can we learn from each other the coping strategies including the SMS self-talk?
* [:)] school problems.. Looking back at MSFM and earlier schools, i had very few problems. 
** Yixin?
* driving (parking) can generate more surprises than walking, sitting...
** car wear-n-tear 
* medical issues esp. with babies and aged -- inevitable
** :) sexual health issues are very common .. we are lucky
* [:)] exercise can generate many unpleasant surprises ... but lack of exercise lead to long-term wellness deterioration. 
** Also, exercise (incl yoga) make us feel stronger against other adversities
* loss of belongings 
* [:)] investment foes... my worries are proportional to the exposure. I have coped well with them so far .. personal strength
* [:)] immigration problems .. so far I handled them well .. personal strength
* credit card -- credit score, missed payment...a necessary evil
* consumer technology (gadgets, services) can generate frustrations, regrettable buys ... complexity.. a necessary evil
* [:)] job search setbacks -- my big strength, a parachute giving me lots of confidence and freedom from care
* annual appraisal .. turned out to be my #1 heaviest Blow/stigma/fear
[:) = lucky or coping well ]
