again, i feel overwhelmed by 
* SG19
* diet, yoga
* work projects -- lucky am a contractor
* trespass charge
* long commute
* .. but luckily
* no health condition like in Jan 2018
* no horrible boss like in Jan 2018

--new blogpost: commute becomes a real pain when stressors stack up
Case: in Apr 2019 the trespass case triggered the reaction and I just wanted to stay home, take rests, research, talk to friends.

These stressors may trigger the same overwhelmed reaction
* kids bad exam results
* family health issues 
* work project down turn
* car problems
* investment failures
* immigration issues

When I get the mtv for coding drill, i can sacrifice diet, sleep or yoga, but not a billable day.
when I get the mtv for QQ including algoQQ and coding experiments, I can sacrifice sleep but not yoga

no need to feel guilty about coding drill. The less guilt the better for my system. The guilt is completely counterproductive and unfair
