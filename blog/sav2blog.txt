--new: Q:2many posts2fuxi@@
Too many worthwhile poss in my blogs. How do I remember their existence?
good method -- short-n-sharp questions as blog titles
good method -- fuxiTitle
good method -- tagging/categories but categories have higher tcost
good method -- send selected content to friends then post on my blog. Enhanced memory retention
method -- use abbr in titles of those worthwhile blogposts, so as to sqeeze in more keywords
method -- post-date
method -- mass print-out once a while for DRAM-refresh
method -- remove outdated posts to reduce noise

--new blogpost: Koreans have their wholesome traditions. My Chinese family also has ours
* daily practices
* home-cooked healthy meals
* more emphasis on CCA rather than exam benchmark
* reading printed more than electronic media

--new: U.S. competition favors motivated candidates
U.S. college admission policy emphasizes candidate motivation. Motivation is partly demonstrated by tough AP courses that a high-school student chooses for herself. 

Similarly, west coast CIV measures motivation.

wife/in-laws often say "You spend so much family time on your studies but are you earning more?" 

Translating personal endeavor to income is holy grail .. frustrating.. Few people can achieve it. Many try personal investment but most fail.

I believe many professionals don't have the abilities to convert spare time to tangible personal growth. 
Tangibility is defined by each individual, and requires a high degree of self-knowledge. 

--no blogpost:
4 days into a week-long vacation, I start to feel the effect of deprivation/starvation of blogging. It is felt like a personal need similar to physical exercise, recreation. Interesting analogy -- starch. How many days can you go without starch before feeling deprived? 

I used blog for tech learning, introspection/reflection, diet management, etc. Deprivation means time availability (supply) falling from 3H to 30 minutes. I could tolerate a cut for a 3 days only.

--new blogpost: spare time as slack resource #blogging,parenting,xx
In 2017 I wrote to Gerald Robinson that spare time depletion would become one of the key challenges/pains of my forthcoming/upcoming adjustments...

Bayonne commute is tolerable only when I have plenty of "slack resource".

For many (probably most) of my peers, if they don't feel the drive to keep learning in their spare time, the resource depletion doesn't feel so harmful....

Parenting (esp. my son) became a huge commitment in terms of my slack resources...

Additional annual leave is supposed to be a slack resource but I think it doesn't reduce the pressure to perform.

--new blogpost: multiple layers@protection(buffer)=>security
Multiple layers@protection or buffer always provide me a real sense of enhanced security. I'm very sensitive to this kinda thing.

[b = I like the imagery of shock-buffer or impact-buffer. They absorb impacts from unexpected adversities and buys me time.]

I wish the list below can be more specific. On the other hand wide-ranging is kinda good.

* [b] eg: low BMI + pull up + fitness .. to protect against wellness "hazards".
* [b] high fruit/veg low fat/starch diet .. to prepare for stress binge
* eg: low visible fat on belly to protect a (almost inevitable) bulging 
* SG and US as two job markets
* west coast and wall st as two job markets
* eg: c++ in addition to java to provide livelihood
* eg: jxee in addition to coreJava to provide many times more job opportunities
* [b] plenty of spare time, rather than fully stretched .. to protect against spare time "resource" depletion
* plenty of paid leaves to protect against "slack resource" (such as spare time) depletion
* wife able to make a living
* multiple passive incomes
* eg: MYS as additional retirement destination
* [b] eg: multiple low-cost laptops for coding drill and git blogging. In crunch time, I need this backup support.
* [b] eg: diskHog/landGrab files to be released when I run out of disk space
* [b] living close to TCM clinic as low-cost alternatives to expensive western clinics
