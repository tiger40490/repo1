Colin said my premium went up by a few percent (50% hike for the private-hospital plans)

If you don't want the hike, then go for the 95% reimbursement

AsiaPropertyDev has  current campaignn to pay 20% in Y1, 21% in Y2 ... 24% in Y5 if client commits 50k. Last payment is 50k * 1.24.

I told Jill this contractual return is too high and a sign of desperation but Jill said CEO adjusts campaign features constantly.

I shared with Jill my observation -- once a while a reputble company disrupts a mature market with drastically reduced cost to customers and captures huge market share

--no blogpost: lesson learned on this flight
15H flight is tolerable on my body though shorter would be less taxing
4H sleep before 15H was insufficient to keep me awake. I felt extremely sleepy some hours after take-off
I didn't try the wine and felt OK. I was too busy on my laptop and simply followed my early decision to take tomato juice ... wise :)
diet? is all about abstinence. not so strict but reasonably good. Removed fried content:)

movie-abstinence -- I did it twice in a row but it may become tough. This time I had plenty of motivation to read java, [[pearls]].

no need to feel guilty about coding drill. The less guilt the better for my system. The guilt is completely counterproductive and unfair

I conceived many worthwhile thoughts about career, parenting, .. High Fertility flight

I relied heavily on laptop but perhaps phone+fake finger might be more convenient -- easier to charge, less bulky. 
However for lengthy writing, laptop wins

--healthy diet tips given by SG HPB #orange
recommended -- sugar substitutes; sugar-free drinks; Chinese tea
orange is safe even though not leanest. Orange is not as low-cal as some veg but Singapore HPB (and many experts would agree) picked orange as the safest food.
