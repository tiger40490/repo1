after talking to Gary, I realized that I could be ffree, but what if I see other people earning a lot more and enjoying those things I consider unnecessary?

I would feel left behind. I think Henry also hinted at the same.
--email to Miles: why I have a warm feeling for New York City
After hearing your first impression of NYC, I decided to take this opportunity to reflect why I have a warm feeling for the big apple.

Many Americans tell me NYC is full of energy.  There are many young people, and many events. They make me feel lively, not lonely. I certainly wish to see more Chinese faces. Luckily, some of those young people (and older guys) attracted to New  York City are actually Chinese. The three Chinatowns in NYC (Manhattan Chinatown, Flushing and eighth avenue) make me feel less isolated than in other U.S. cities.  Jersey City also has a large Chinese population, much higher than an average U.S. city.

NYC is more diverse, i.e.less white.

Incomes are slightly higher in NYC than other U.S. cities. I feel lucky for that. Even though prices are also higher, I donâ€™t usually buy anything in Manhattan. As a result, I get to save more in NYC than other cities. 

NYC offers more diverse job choices and education choices. Makes me feel less boxed in less restricted and more free.

My family income is not high. Many "nicer" locations of U.S. are higher income. I actually feel poor in those locations when my neighbors all earn higher. NYC has many poor residents, and make me not so left out.
