when I criticize boy's unnecessary spend on fancy subway sandwich, I should remember my own "unnecessary" lunch-after-lunch.

Note boy's sandwich is relatively healthy by his standard.

I told a counselor that I would tell the 11 year old tanbin that "no one is perfect or powerful. Everyone of us is weak."

Majority of the people in my "home" cities waste numerous small amounts of money on a monthly basis. Over decades they "throw down the drain" a painful portion (like 10-20%) of their income.

Large number of small time-wastage is similar. We feel the pain only years later.

calorie-quota overconsumption is similar. We look back and feel the pain, sooner or later.

Among these ...., usable time is the most scarce, available up to age 60 or 55 for some.

Among these talents, the most significant (was $) is calorie-quota budgeting. It has long-term health benefits.

Among these endeavors, my success is most visible and decisive in $$, and least in time-saving

calorie-quota is a similar concept to carbon-quota. Each country each year is given a quota. If you over use then you need to borrow from the future quota.

--new: introspective: self-control: ctbz 寸土必争
(oth_risk. This blogpost needs a better title)
Aha! 寸土必争 is a daily struggle, tough for everyone. It's actually my competitive strength!

Once I set a (realistic) numerical target for my endeavor, I push myself to execute my plan with ruthless, clinical precision, semi-consciously beating up myself whenever I deviate visibly.

This attitude/habit is effective in some domains --
* Polyclinic dietitian .. without precision, calorie reduction will be futile
* Some people save for months then spend all the savings at year end
* my burn_rate_control (ffree) is the poster child success story
* quitting from substance addiction 
* focus on time utilization is a great example. Many people spend time (and $) in "fun" places that actually don't create a lot of pleasure.

However, with early rise, I feel my 寸土必争 attitude may not be necessary, possibly counterproductive.

weekly coding drill, daily yoga, daily workout ... don't need 寸土必争. Momentum is more important
