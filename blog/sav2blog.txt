--new: Q:2many posts2fx@@
Too many worthwhile poss in my blogs. How do I remember their existence?
good method -- short-n-sharp questions as blog titles
good method -- fuxiTitle
good method -- tagging/categories but categories have higher tcost
good method -- send selected content to friends then post on my blog. Enhanced memory retention
method -- use abbr in titles of those worthwhile blogposts, so as to sqeeze in more keywords
method -- post-date
method -- mass print-out once a while for DRAM-refresh
method -- remove outdated posts to reduce noise


--new blogpost: note-taking on phone
I think those who use phone in favor of paper or laptop are not serious note takers. The phone has serious limitations for note taking. Inefficient due to screen+keyboard sizes.

During my early 30's with my $100 Palm + foldable keyboard, I was able to take notes better.

Overall, phone (and smemo) is good for brief notes below half a page.

Q: Do phones offer any advantages?
A: compared to laptop or paper, audio-blogging on phone has proven fairly useful
A: compared to laptop, more nimble and light-weight. one-hand operation
A: compared to laptop, backup via gmail is more available.
A: compared to laptop, battery recharge is easier at any USB socket. Laptop recharge has been a minor stressor
A: compared to paper, I was able to insert or delete content. Copy-paste is ... feasible though inconvenient.
A: compared to paper, mass upload is feasible
A: compared to paper, I was able to keep many small topical notes in multiple "pages". The more pages, the more visible this advantage becomes. With 10 "pages", the paper solution became stressful as I worried about losing them wholesale.

Tip: in 2018 I started using designated sequence of dots q[.] in place of comma or dash

git-blogging lets me chip away at multiple (new or existing) posts. More efficient than frequent access to wordpress !

--new: taxi beats uber at airport region
on 17 Jun 2019, I should have taken a taxi at Terminal 1 taxi stand. 
Instead I decided to save fare by going to Fed Circle, but there was no taxi stand so I had to use Uber, which was cumbersome on my phone and required waiting. 
This is bad if fatigue or cold weather.

Taxi is not price-guaranteed in advance, and offers no complaint->refund feature, but overall beats Uber hands-down in this high-stake scenario.

In this scenario, i need familiarity, seamless reliability...

If we must use uber next time, then ensure we know the route and we have the offline map or printed map

--new: traveling to unfamiliar places: prefer 24x7 hotels
on 17 Jun 2019 I found myself in rain, at quiet hours without anyone on the street to consult. The address plates on the buildings were too small to read in the dark. I believe the only solution is phone call but the host is not a hotel desk and didn't answer my calls.

This risk proved to be too high so I won't take the same risk. No Airbnb no homestay. I need a real hotel with 24x7 service.

My flight was delayed by 3 hours and I had only 5 hours to recuperate before going to work :(

Things could have been even worse if
* cold
* more luggage
* fatigue

If we must use a homestay then be sure to speak to host before-hand, not just rely on email. Be sure to agree on arrival time.

--new: traveling to unfamiliar places: provide phone battery and mobile data
on 17 Jun 2019 I was highly dependent on my smart phone for
* uber
* map
* call

--no blogpost: Koreans have their traditions. My Chinese family also has our traditions

* more emphasis on CCA rather than exam benchmark
* reading printed more than electronic media

--new: U.S. competition favors motivated candidates
U.S. college admission policy emphasizes candidate motivation. Motivation is partly demonstrated by tough AP courses that a high-school student chooses for herself. 

Similarly, west coast CIV measures motivation.

wife/in-laws often say "You spend so much family time on your studies but are you earning more?" 

Translating personal endeavor to income is holy grail .. frustrating.. Few people can achieve it. Many try personal investment but most fail.

I believe many professionals don't have the abilities to convert spare time to tangible personal growth. 
Tangibility is defined by each individual, and requires a high degree of self-knowledge.

4 days into a week-long vacation, I start to feel the effect of deprivation/starvation of blogging. It is felt like a personal need similar to physical exercise, recreation. Interesting analogy -- starch. How many days can you go without starch before feeling deprived? 

I used blog for tech learning, introspection/reflection, diet management, etc. Deprivation means time availability (supply) falling from 3H to 30 minutes. I could tolerate a cut for a 3 days only.

Many smarter women become scheming and cunning (I ran out of English adjectives) to take advantage of the husbands. 

In contrast, my wife is a simple women, so I feel very safe and secure in our relationship. Simplicity is her virtue.

--new blogpost: spare time as slack resource #blogging,parenting,xx
In 2017 I wrote to Gerald Robinson that spare time depletion would become one of the key challenges/pains of my forthcoming/upcoming adjustments...

Bayonne commute is tolerable only when I have plenty of "slack resource".

For many (probably most) of my peers, if they don't feel the drive to keep learning in their spare time, the resource depletion doesn't feel so harmful....

Parenting (esp. my son) became a huge commitment in terms of my slack resources...

Additional annual leave is supposed to be a slack resource but I think it doesn't reduce the pressure to perform.

--new blogpost: multiple layers@protection(buffer)=>security
Multiple layers@protection or buffer always provide me a real sense of enhanced security. I'm very sensitive to this kinda thing.

[b = I like the imagery of shock-buffer or impact-buffer. They absorb impacts from unexpected adversities and buys me time.]

I wish the list below can be more specific. On the other hand wide-ranging is kinda good.

* [b] eg: low BMI + pull up + fitness .. to protect against wellness "hazards".
* [b] high fruit/veg low fat/starch diet .. to prepare for stress binge
* eg: low visible fat on belly to protect a (almost inevitable) bulging 
* SG and US as two job markets
* west coast and wall st as two job markets
* eg: c++ in addition to java to provide livelihood
* eg: jxee in addition to coreJava to provide many times more job opportunities
* [b] plenty of spare time, rather than fully stretched .. to protect against spare time "resource" depletion
* plenty of paid leaves to protect against "slack resource" (such as spare time) depletion
* wife able to make a living
* multiple passive incomes
* eg: MYS as additional retirement destination
* [b] eg: multiple low-cost laptops for coding drill and git blogging. In crunch time, I need this backup support.
* [b] eg: diskHog/landGrab files to be released when I run out of disk space
* [b] living close to TCM clinic as low-cost alternatives to expensive western clinics
