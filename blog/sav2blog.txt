any time a parent says "this punishment/penalty can only be reduced under special conditions like weather", the implicit, unspoken but obvious truth shines through -- a man-made consequence, not a natural consequence.

The point systems is an attempt to mimic the natural consequences in "outside" world but unfortunately parents, rather than a computer, must make decisions each time.

There are preciously few natural consequences visibly beyond parents' control 
* homework delay -> teacher scolding
* late to school -> teacher scolding

Don't blame yourself for your (legitimate) need for reflective diary since 15. 
This need has sizable tcosts but lower total-cost than other people's idiosyncrasies like photography, gaming, shopping, chess, DIY home improvement, home decoration, fine dining, news junkie ...

Similarly,
Don't scold yourself (as a weakling) that you can't sleep upright 
Don't feel self-pity if you are 1.9m tall and can't feel comfortable flying economy
Don't blame grandma for her sensitivity to heat
Don't despise yourself that you aren't a manager type and can't follow those high-flier classmates
Don't scold your son that his absorbency is lower than his classmates'.

On commute Which mode is more efficient:
* blog -> print -> jotting-> transcribe
* laptop git blogging ... incremental updates or lengthy writing
--no blogpost: lesson learned on this flight
15H flight is tolerable on my body though shorter would be less taxing
4H sleep before 15H was insufficient to keep me awake. I felt extremely sleepy some hours after take-off
I didn't try the wine and felt OK. I was too busy on my laptop and simply followed my early decision to take tomato juice ... wise :)
diet? is all about abstinence. not so strict but reasonably good. Removed fried content:)

movie-abstinence -- I did it twice in a row but it may become tough. This time I had plenty of motivation to read java, [[pearls]].

no need to feel guilty about coding drill. The less guilt the better for my system. The guilt is completely counterproductive and unfair

I conceived many worthwhile thoughts about career, parenting, .. High Fertility flight

I relied heavily on laptop but perhaps phone+fake finger might be more convenient -- easier to charge, less bulky. 
However for lengthy writing, laptop wins
