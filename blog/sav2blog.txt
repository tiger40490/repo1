--new: taxi beats uber at airport region
on 17 Jun 2019, I should have taken a taxi at Terminal 1 taxi stand. 
Instead I decided to save fare by going to Fed Circle, but there was no taxi stand so I had to use Uber, which was cumbersome on my phone and required waiting. 
This is bad if fatigue or cold weather.

Taxi is not price-guaranteed in advance, and offers no complaint->refund feature, but overall beats Uber hands-down in this case.

--new: traveling to unfamiliar places: prefer 24x7 hotels
on 17 Jun 2019 I found myself in rain, at quiet hours without anyone to ask. The street addresses are too hard to read in the dark. The only solution is phone call but the "host" is not a hotel desk and didn't answer calls

This risk is too high so I won't take the same risk. No Airbnb. I need a reputable hotel with 24x7 service.

My flight was delayed by 3 hours and I had only 5 hours to recharge before going to work :(

Things could have been worse if
* cold
* more luggage
* fatigue

--new: traveling to unfamiliar places: provide phone battery and mobile data
on 17 Jun 2019 I was highly dependent on my smart phone for
* uber
* map
* call

--new blogpost note-taking on phone
I think those who use phone in favor of paper or laptop are not serious note takers. The phone has serious limitations for note taking. Inefficient due to screen+keyboard sizes.

With my $100 Palm + foldable keyboard during my early 30's, I was able to take notes better.

Overall, phone (and smemo) is only good for brief notes below half a page.

Q: Do phones offer any advantages?
A: compared to laptop or paper, audio-blogging on phone has proven fairly useful
A: compared to laptop, more nimble and light-weight. one-hand operation
A: compared to laptop, backup via gmail is more available.
A: compared to laptop, battery recharge is easier at any USB socket. Laptop recharge has been a minor stressor
A: compared to paper, I was able to insert or delete content. Copy-paste is ... feasible though inconvenient.
A: compared to paper, mass upload is feasible
A: compared to paper, I was able to keep many small topical notes in multiple "pages". The more pages, the more visible this advantage becomes. With 10 "pages", the paper solution became stressful as I worried about losing them wholesale.

Tip: in 2018 I started using designated sequence of dots q[.] in place of comma or dash

wife/in-laws often say "You spend so much family time on your studies but are you earning more?" 

Translating personal endeavor to income is holy grail .. frustrating.. Few people can achieve it. Many try personal investment but most fail.

I believe many professionals don't have the abilities to convert spare time to tangible personal growth. 
Tangibility is defined by each individual, and requires a high degree of self-knowledge. 

--new blogpost:
4 days into a week-long vacation, I start to feel the effect of deprivation/starvation of blogging. It is felt like a personal need similar to physical exercise, recreation. Interesting analogy -- starch. How many days can you go without starch before feeling deprived? 

I used blog for tech learning, introspection/reflection, diet management, etc. Deprivation means time availability (supply) falling from 3H to 30 minutes. I could tolerate a cut for a 3 days only.

My wife is a simple women, so I feel very safe. Simplicity is her virtue.

--new blogpost: spare time as slack resource
In 2017 I wrote to Gerald Robinson that spare time depletion is one of the key challenges/pains of the upcoming adjustments...

Bayonne commute is tolerable only when I have plenty of "slack resource".

For many (probably most) of my peers, if they don't feel the drive to keep learning in their spare time, the resource depletion doesn't feel like a depletion....

Parenting (esp. my son) became a huge commitment in terms of my slack resources...

Additional annual leave is supposed to be a slack resource but I think it doesn't reduce the pressure to perform.

--new blogpost: multiple layers of "protection" or buffer always gives me real sense of enhanced security
* eg: low BMI + pull up + fitness .. to protect against wellness "hazards".
* eg: high fruit/veg low fat/starch diet .. to prepare for stress binge
* eg: low visible fat on belly to protect a (almost inevitable) bulging 
* eg: SG and US as two job markets
* eg: west coast and wall st as two job markets
* eg: c++ in addition to java to provide livelihood
* eg: plenty of spare time, rather than fully stretched .. to protect against spare time "resource" depletion
* eg: plenty of paid leaves to protect against slack resource depletion
* eg: wife able to make a living
* eg: multiple passive incomes
* eg: MYS as additional retirement destination
* eg: multiple low-cost laptops
