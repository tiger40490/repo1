Singaporean amateur sports participants tend to use high-end equipment because they can afford it.

I used to say that despite the world-class facilities, SG is not producing world-class athletes. 

Now I feel a major goal of the SG government is promoting physical wellness of the average Singaporeans. So quality of facilities do matter.

Chinese students are no longer the most motivated once in college. Other nationalities catch up as they find the motivation.

I think my son may be that type of late bloomer

My sister is a late bloomer. She didn't give up working hard.

On the job, I can see the Chinese colleagues NOT more motivated than other nationalities, not at all.

--new: gadget set-up anxiety
I tend to experience a lot of anxiety when I set up my new devices, esp. smart phone and laptops.

We all exeprience a growing, unwanted dependency on gadgets. I want independence.
My dependency is due to efficiency ...
I use gadgets not only for communications but as extension of my brain.

Q: Can you live a day without this gadget?
