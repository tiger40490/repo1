--jolt: PIP^jobloss fear
For me, job loss is a much lighter stressor than PIP fear. 

In fact, I don't worry about end of contract and benchtime. I worry more about humiliating bonus.

I'd rather lose a job than receiving a salary on PIP.

Most friends assume that my PIP fear was fundamentally related to cashflow worry, but I am confident about job hunting. So my PIP fear is all about ego and unrelated to cashflow.

--comparing 3 major stressors
* PIP
* brank envy 
* burn rate stress including jobloss fear

jolt: FSM div never delivered the destressor as /envisioned/.
In contrast, my GRR has produced /substantial/ nonwork income, but still insufficient to counter the threat of PIP !

Jobloss stressor is alleviated by this income, fairly effectively!

I feel most "ordinary" people's stress come from burn rate, (making ends meet), including jobloss fear
I feel the middle class families around me could survive at a much lower burn rate of SGD 3.5-4.5k (or USD 6k -- no 1st-hand experience) but they choose the rat race of keeping up with the Joneses (FOMO). Therefore, their burn rate becomes 6k or 15k. 

For some, FOMO takes them to the next level -- benchmarking against the high-flyers. 

For the middle class, any burn rate exceeding 3k is a stressor because the working adults now need to keep a job , rather than enjoy leisure time.

With a full time job, workers experience a full spectrum of stressors including PIP

--The annoyances can grow into stressors. Therefore, it's best to tackle these challenges when not under stress

* bofa credit balance cheques
* retrofitness extra charges
* tax filing
* hardware breakdowns

What kinda buffer would be effective against these random stressors? 
* consistent time allocated to coding drill
* consistent time allocated to jogging, yoga and strength training
* short commute
* evening/weekend flexible work hours
* adequate rest including sleep
* plenty of paid time-off? 
* movies?

-- good to review my reactions to random adversities
* trespass
* credit card fraud
* overcharge on my accounts

====new: martyrdom 
martyrdom is fundamentally related to my burn/rot concept

-- Origin of this word -- One who voluntarily suffers death as the penalty for refusing to renounce their religion

-- idealist purity
By my standard, every human is lazy, weak, loser

-- no pain no gain -- is A related phrase. I addressed this point when a MorganStanley colleague described my extreme diet as self-discipline (more like self-restraint). I said deprivation is unsustainable.

-- Burn/rot is mostly materialistic pursuit + self-discipline ... martyrdom?

--fuxi: when I get fixated on brank I had better remember perception of reality

* Look this guy has a fancy car... but a car is a liability not an cashcow assets like div stock
* Do they have a beautiful wife?
* Do they have a branded degree?
* Do they have an accomplished father?
* Do they have a healthy mother?
* Do they have two lovely kids?

-- new: brank~=luxury car
What's in common between a luxury car and a brank like "Director"?
* enviable, glamorous, glorifying
* high maintenance
* can wear out quickly
* you need some minimum capacity to maintain it
* not necessarily a cashcow asset

at my age now, am more focused on cutting daily calories than cutting daily expenses.

belt-tightening is my traditional strength

--new: profit lock-in
when I notice a self-efficacy/aborbency/// "power surge", when I feel so powerful that I could overcome anything... I had better stop to ask myself "which tough jobs are becoming Spicy?". We had better aim to capture that power and lock in a "profit".

[15%] occasionally the wrong-time temptation becomes clearly more manageable as I feel more in control of my appetite.

[21%] Sometimes I get in the mood for localSys or company projects. Should consider camp-out.

Frequently, jogging becomes physicaly enjoyable (30%) or at least sustainable (60%). It's dangerous to expect this "peak" to last. Danger in terms of disappointment.

[25%] Sometimes coding drill gathers momentum and become sustainable on a weekly basis. Enjoyable is rarer like 5%.

[9%] Once a while my internal resistance to chin-up or yoga home-practice improves so much that I could do it on a Daily basis, but it seldom stays at that optimal level.

[19%] Sometimes my patience/capacity and ... for word problem coaching improves. This /space/ is a high-stake game, and remains highly unstable as I continue to lose grip and experience limited self-understanding. This is now the most challenging domain.

But look at those guys who do. These guys typically lack self-discipline and now show a belly, sluggish, affected by tabaco, alcohol,,,

--fuxi: worst stressful period=2008-09
After boy was born, my stress profile deteriorated quickly over long and short term. T-budget strain.. heavy responsibility
I had no passive income  to supplement my salary,,, belt-tightening
My stress profile was significantly worse than 2006 in SG, despite my higher income. 

fear of job loss
I had no "multiple countries" to choose from. I fact I felt trapped and unwanted. I briefly considered quitting the U.S. returning to SG...
PIP was the main stressor
Salary was low -- actually a stressor since U.S. burn rate was much higher than in SG.
long commute from Brooklyn. Couldn't afford $2.5k rental in Jersey City.
Camp-out was a relief
java market depth as a parachute, cushion and safety net, was unavailable to me at that time.

when I criticize boy's unnecessary spend on fancy subway sandwich, I should remember my own "unnecessary" lunch-after-lunch.

Note boy's sandwich is relatively healthy by his standard.

I told a counselor that I would tell the 11 year old tanbin that "no one is perfect or powerful. Everyone of us is weak."

oth_risk

Majority of the people in my "home" cities waste numerous small amounts of money on a monthly basis. Over decades they "throw down the drain" a painful portion (like 10-20%) of their income.

Large number of small time-wastage is similar. Some of us feel the pain only years later when our peers make progress in their spare time or their office hours.

calorie-quota overconsumption is similar. We look back and feel the pain, sooner or later.

Among these ...., usable time is the most scarce, available up to age 60 or 55 for some.

Among these talents, the most significant (was $) is calorie-quota budgeting. It has long-term health benefits.

Among these endeavors, my success is most visible and decisive in $$, and least in time-saving

calorie-quota is a similar concept to carbon-quota. Each country each year is given a quota. If you over use then you need to borrow from the future quota.


--new: 
one of the most obvious and real limitation/obsolete features of c++ as a language is the tool chain.
Part of the ecosystem
Too complicated compared to newer languages like java. The dynamic scripting languages are even simpler

Also an entry barrier. Young people can take it up if determined, but majority of them are put off. 

There's a minimum mileage required. Many young people don't stay on it long enough. 

My vi mileage is also too short.

In my early days using c++, I tried to set up eclipse CDT and spent lots of time on the tool chain. My goal was to set up similar convenience ... Futile. Not worthwhile. java tools are much better. Most c++ programmers don't bother with such convenience and rely on command line tools.

Similarly, yoga is hard for most people but some individuals are determined and can overcome the initial hump (6-24M) and find joy and reward
