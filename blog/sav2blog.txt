--I get into crises-type anxieties far too often ..
Let's be slightly more rational and ask ourselves -- what events can qualify as a crisis? Let's list up to 9 high-level categories. I think they all have some timeline.

* kids developmental problem
* medical condition that should not be postponed indefinitely. Note aging issues are things to be accepted gracefully.
* mounting financial loss 
* family tension
* things out@service but actually needed. Counter example: the bedroom door repair can be postponed.

Here are some fake crises:
* my engagement honeymoon on the new job has ended
* my time allocation differs from my rational model -- so what?
* my spare time is not generating any ROTI -- but when did it?
* my workout time has reduced -- but any real effect on my health?

Slightly less often we notice a shocking deteriorating condition, but irrevesible hence no 'timeline'. I think what we need most is acceptance with serenity.
* skin, hair condition, perhaps due to aging
* c++ programmers' life becoming tougher on wall st
* growing population of younger, brighter developers in Singapore job market

Who have the serenity and the discernment? Grandpa, ..

--jot: my effective tactics against personal limitations are never brute force willpower.
Willpower doesn't work for me even though some level of self-discipline is required.

I always need something smarter, more personalized, less direct,  more subtle, 

.. yoga
.. coding drill
.. boy

--yoga^coding_drill 
In both cases, a key derailer is peer comparison, which leads to "engine loss of power"

--update blogpost: my notations
AAA > AAa > AA. Only last letter can be lower case
AA > AA-
Choose either the Aa scheme or the A- scheme. Don't mix.
The Aa scheme is more granular;
The A- scheme is more visual

--new: ##rare achievements used as mere basic std
I tend to feel inferior, self-hate... by benchmarkig against these rare achievements as if they are commonplace.

* My MSFM 
* my jogging habit
* my chin-up
* my academic achievement in P6, Shiyan, HJC...
* Steve Keith working on math in his spare time
* my friends describing their childhood training in piano, calligraphy, math
* me or other people achieving focus in office. Actually Lack of focus is the norm!
* grandpa's level of focus


--new: clarity of thinking is a non-trivial strength in me
Many friends say I'm very reflective and demonstrate Grade-A self knowledge and self analysis. 

I feel many friends don't show clarity of thinking. My sis, dad show clarity.

Vocab is only a top-10 factor but can help a lot, esp. when a common phrase is ambiguous and confusing.

I explain my content very clearly to myself, not always so clearly to "them". To me, clarity of thought is mostly a self-management skill, so I don't worry about "them".

Brevity is perhaps a top 5 clarity factor. I tend to be good in brevity of writing. Some verbal-type individuals show exceptional clarity. Genn?

--Q: am I avoiding the tough and high-leverage "burn" jobs?
* yoga ... is by far the toughest job... actually am taking on the challenge 
* jogging .. is more comfortable than yoga
* pull-up and push-up
* coding drill
(QQ is more comfortable than coding drill)
* BGC planning  -- am taking it on by talking to Raymond and Chun Tih. Not really high leverage.
* boy's math -- am taking it on
* work project and localSys xx -- am taking on some of the challenges. 
* FX robot? not so tough
* standing to work

--email to Miles: why I have a warm feeling for New York City
After hearing your first impression of NYC, I decided to take this opportunity to reflect why I have a warm feeling for the big apple.

Many Americans tell me NYC is full of energy.  There are many young people, and many events. They make me feel lively, not lonely. I certainly wish to see more Chinese faces. Luckily, some of those young people (and older guys) attracted to New  York City are actually Chinese. The three Chinatowns in NYC (Manhattan Chinatown, Flushing and eighth avenue) make me feel less isolated than in other U.S. cities.  Jersey City also has a large Chinese population, much higher than an average U.S. city.

NYC is more inclusive, more diverse, i.e.less white.

NYC offers more diverse job choices and education choices. Makes me feel less boxed in less restricted and more free.

I don't like car ownership and NYC is less car-dependent mostly due to the subway which runs 24-hours. NYC also has more buses than most US cities. 

Incomes are slightly higher in NYC than other U.S. cities. I feel lucky for that. Even though prices are also higher, I donâ€™t usually buy anything in Manhattan. As a result, I get to save more in NYC than other cities. 

My family income is not high. Many "nicer" locations of U.S. are higher income. I actually feel poor living in those locations when my neighbors all earn higher. NYC has many low-income residents, and I feel not so left-out.
