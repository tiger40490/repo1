git-blogging is not perfect. print-out is more accessible. Lower friction.

4 days into a week-long vacation, I start to feel the effect of deprivation/starvation of blogging. It is felt like a personal need similar to physical exercise, recreation. Interesting analogy -- starch. How many days can you go without starch before feeling deprived? 

I used blog for tech learning, introspection/reflection, diet management, etc. Deprivation means time availability (supply) falling from 3H to 30 minutes. I could tolerate a cut for 3 days only.

Q: how do I get more quiet time while living with family?  Note I need more quiet time than other fathers. I suffer more from the family distractions. 

I need quiet time for thinking/blogging about
* investment
* wellness planning and management
* many many non-trivial decisions
* managing other stressful items

Depending on the specific task on my plate, I will find ... "alternatives" since quiet time is simply insufficient compared to my NY days.

Sugg: stay in office longer, better in early morning but in the evening by default 
sugg: Friday evening is golden. Other parts of the weekend can also be valuable
Sugg: take half-day leaves to create half-day quiet periods at home. This feature isn't available to contractor
Sugg: yo-yo diet on tech xx -- when we get the quiet time (in the mood or not), learn as much as possible.
Sugg: On some days, sleep early and catch earlier trains so I can study on trains; On other days, stay up late for quiet hours at night
