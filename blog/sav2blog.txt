--Cancer is one the most realistic threats to longevity. In my case, the #1 manageable factor is chronic stress (more than diet, sleep,,,), so I will list the *true* persistent stressors -- where I suffered real blows, over extended periods of my life.

1) PIP; damaged goods; bonus; 
) FOMO i.e. left-behind by the "peers"
) short and long-term disappointments with boy

Strangely, I never felt hit long and hard by cholesterol, GreenCard, JobSearch, 

My #1 stress relief is my cashflow 
2nd is my IV body-building
G5: is my SG citizenship
G5: WallSt contract job market

fundamental training. More "health promotion" please. Use vi even when notepad++ is readily available

in SG 1-12 schools, i quickly had a deep and complete feeling that no local student was bold, innovative like me, and all were too conformable and compliant.

In hind sight, I can see that some small percentage of local students were unconventional like me, but they didn't want to show it.

* foreign students in local schools -- In local schools, there are also many foreign students, but I consider Malaysian students local.
* non-local schools -- I would guess in international schools the culture would be more diverse, with students from far away or developed countries
* Singapore students educated overseas -- some of them are not so conformable.
* university instead of 1-12 -- I found more local students like me
* At the workplace -- many local graduates are not so conformable.

--the 2 recurring pains captured in my blogs
1) PIP
2) peer comparison -- such as left-behind, brank (but how about beautiful wife, wellness, edu credentials)

Now I can name the 3rd recurring pain -- boy's current (rather than longer-horizon) academic situation, such as (but not limited to) motivation level and time-mgmt

look in the mirror and tell yourself "You are good enough".

If no kids, then I feel I would have won the war against FOMO and pretty much all the battles I care to fight.

If no wife, then I would have won more completely more comfortably.
