--no blogpost: lesson learned on this flight
15H flight is tolerable on my body though shorter would be less taxing
diet? is all about abstinence. not so strict but reasonably good. Removed fried content:)

no need to feel guilty about coding drill. The less guilt the better for my system. The guilt is completely counterproductive and unfair

I conceived many worthwhile thoughts about career, parenting, .. High Fertility flight

I relied heavily on laptop but perhaps phone+fake finger might be more convenient -- easier to charge, less bulky. 
However for lengthy writing, laptop wins
