--introspective: self-control: 寸土必争
(This blogpost needs a better title)

Once I set a (realistic) numerical target for my endeavor, I push myself to execute my plan with ruthless precision, semi-consciously beating up myself whenever I deviate visibly.

This attitude/habit is effective in some domains --
* Polyclinic dietitian .. without clinical precision, calorie reduction will be futile
* Some people save for months then spend all the savings at year end
* my burn_rate_control (ffree) is the poster child success story
* quitting from substance addiction 
* focus on time utilization is a great example. Many people spend time (and $) in "fun" places that actually don't create a lot of pleasure.

However, with early rise, I feel my 寸土必争 attitude may not be necessary, possibly counterproductive.

weekly coding drill, daily yoga, daily workout ... don't need 寸土必争. Momentum is more important

my introspective self-discovery is iterative, self-correcting and endless like editing a wikipedia article. 
I don't feel very effective because there are always too many things I don't understand about myself...

However, I never feel inferior (hopeless compared to "them") as felt in yoga, coding practice, or moving-up

--Cancer is one the most realistic threats to longevity. In my case, the #1 manageable factor is chronic stress (more than diet, sleep,,,), so I will list the /true/ persistent stressors -- from which I have suffered real blows, over extended periods of my life.

1) PIP; damaged goods; bonus; 
) FOMO i.e. left-behind by the (wrong) "peers"

Are these cancer-stress?
* worry about difficulty of filing tax in 2020 due to mobile number
* anxiety due to loss of ikea receipt

Strangely, I never felt hit long and hard by cholesterol, GreenCard, JobSearch, 

In terms of cancer-stress relieves and protections, 
My #1 relief is my cashflow mgmt
2nd is my IV body-building
G5: my SG citizenship
G5: WallSt contract market
G5: my wellness

--jolt: pay to enter a marathon?
Mr ERE would not spend that money. Presumably he would not spend on yoga classes, packaged salad or fancy fruits.

Reality is, spending money on these things do improve my health. If you ask me to DIY at home, I know I would fail due to limited self-discipline or drive.

in SG 1-12 schools, i quickly had a deep and complete feeling that no local student was bold, innovative like me, and all were too conformable and compliant.

In hind sight, I can see that some small percentage of local students were unconventional like me, but they didn't want to show it.

* foreign students in local schools -- In local schools, there are also many foreign students, but I consider Malaysian students local.
* non-local schools -- I would guess in international schools the culture would be more diverse, with students from far away or developed countries
* Singapore students educated overseas -- some of them are not so conformable.
* university instead of 1-12 -- I found more local students like me
* At the workplace -- many local graduates are not so conformable.

--the 2 recurring pains captured in my blogs
1) PIP
2) peer comparison -- such as left-behind, brank (but how about beautiful wife, wellness, edu credentials)

Now I can name the 3rd recurring pain -- boy's current (rather than longer-horizon) academic situation, such as (but not limited to) motivation level and time-mgmt

look in the mirror and tell yourself "You are good enough".

If no kids, then I feel I would have won the war against FOMO and pretty much all the battles I care to fight.

If no wife, then I would have won more completely more comfortably.
