wife/in-laws often say "You spend so much family time on your studies but are you earning more?" 

Translating personal endeavor to income is holy grail .. frustrating.. Few people can achieve it. Many try personal investment but most fail.

I believe many professionals don't have the abilities to convert spare time to tangible personal growth. 
Tangibility is defined by each individual, and requires a high degree of self-knowledge.

4 days into a week-long vacation, I start to feel the effect of deprivation/starvation of blogging. It is felt like a personal need similar to physical exercise, recreation. Interesting analogy -- starch. How many days can you go without starch before feeling deprived? 

I used blog for tech learning, introspection/reflection, diet management, etc. Deprivation means time availability (supply) falling from 3H to 30 minutes. I could tolerate a cut for a 3 days only.

many smarter women become scheming and take advantage of the husbands. 

My wife is a simple women, so I feel very safe. Simplicity is her virtue.

--new blogpost: spare time as slack resource
In 2017 I wrote to Gerald Robinson that spare time depletion is one of the key challenges/pains of the upcoming adjustments...

Bayonne commute is tolerable only when I have plenty of "slack resource".

For many (probably most) of my peers, if they don't feel the drive to keep learning in their spare time, the resource depletion doesn't feel like a depletion....

Parenting (esp. my son) became a huge commitment in terms of my slack resources...

Additional annual leave is supposed to be a slack resource but I think it doesn't reduce the pressure to perform.

--new blogpost: multiple layers of "protection" or buffer always gives me real sense of enhanced security
* eg: low BMI + pull up + fitness .. to protect against wellness "hazards".
* eg: high fruit/veg low fat/starch diet .. to prepare for stress binge
* eg: low visible fat on belly to protect a (almost inevitable) bulging 
* eg: SG and US as two job markets
* eg: west coast and wall st as two job markets
* eg: c++ in addition to java to provide livelihood
* eg: plenty of spare time, rather than fully stretched .. to protect against spare time "resource" depletion
* eg: plenty of paid leaves to protect against slack resource depletion
* eg: wife able to make a living
* eg: multiple passive incomes
* eg: MYS as additional retirement destination
* eg: multiple low-cost laptops
