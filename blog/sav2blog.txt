On commute Which mode is more efficient:
* blog -> print -> jotting-> transcribe
* laptop git blogging ... incremental updates or lengthy writing
--no blogpost: lesson learned on this flight
15H flight is tolerable on my body though shorter would be less taxing
4H sleep before 15H was insufficient to keep me awake. I felt extremely sleepy some hours after take-off
I didn't try the wine and felt OK. I was too busy on my laptop and simply followed my early decision to take tomato juice ... wise :)
diet? is all about abstinence. not so strict but reasonably good. Removed fried content:)

movie-abstinence -- I did it twice in a row but it may become tough. This time I had plenty of motivation to read java, [[pearls]].

no need to feel guilty about coding drill. The less guilt the better for my system. The guilt is completely counterproductive and unfair

I conceived many worthwhile thoughts about career, parenting, .. High Fertility flight

I relied heavily on laptop but perhaps phone+fake finger might be more convenient -- easier to charge, less bulky. 
However for lengthy writing, laptop wins
