--update blogpost on git blogging
One of the heaviest tcosts in blogging is searching for related blog posts (and updating one of more of them)
git-blogging let's me work on a new content gradually, and only put it on the blog after 10 revisions in git. At that time, it could be a new blogpost or an update to one old blogpost.

--stress profile 2 Sep
Stressor #1 new job ramp up during first month
stressor #2 BGC payment
stressor #3 satisfying sex. Not a destressor ... why? I seem to take it as a basic need but many people don't have it and still feel OK
stressor: insufficient outgoing minutes... cost overrun.. consider buying more minutes just to contain the stress
stressor: data overusage. I added mobile data limit
stressor: phone + laptop battery draining
stressor: watch battery. I chose the reliable service shop
stressor: the HY exposure is still too high.
[*] destressor: blogging as a tool for focus, clarification, zoom-in
destressor/declutter: cancelled Everyday ccard
destressor/declutter: cancelled multiple oc accounts
destressor: converted USD 5k, as 5k at home is a stressor

intelligence, memory capacity, clear thinking, sharp perception ... can help the individual deal with depression and pessimism. I think most pessimistic thoughts are irrational and/or biased.

"Explanatory style" .. see [[learned optimism]]

"Mindfulness" is a therapy. This therapy can even cope with brain aging.

Memory is a muscle.. I think corrective thinking like my twister SMS is also a muscle one can improve by everyday training.

--some lux items, highlighting diverging personal priorities
Japan vacation with kids -- is probably the most visible lux items. I may need to say No. Consider postponing it to my 60's when they grow up.
top schools (+school district) -- fraction of a million. Simply beyond my means

full-day interview -- costs me a day of billing, but no more than 3 days a year

--no blog: unbroken.. a few nice items
wrist watch
body scale
etone callback
intimacy

--nothing new: Over the 2019 final days in the U.S. i felt very lucky
* surprise improvement -- C++ critical mass while coreJava remains a competency
* surprise improvement -- CIV is now becoming my 2nd competitive advantage after QQ
* [unbroken] health + vitality 
* [unbroken] marriage
* new plan of dev-till-70
* surprise improvement -- most young talents shun the contract job market, for fundamental reasons, leaving the field wide open to me.
* surprise improvement (tentative) -- startup and web2.0 shops are emerging as new frontiers, beside ibanks. Remember the c#/quant/swing adventures
* surprise improvement (short term) -- contract rate slowly rising

With my marketable skills + health, in the U.S. everything will work out in my personal life, 
* even though U.S. convenience level is low
* even though U.S. commute is much worse than SG. Some WFH will help.
* even though my kids may not become top students
* even though my wife may not find meaningful job

--lessons from final JFK trip
transfer between trains, while carrying 3 luggages is tricky and requires assistance

--Retirement
Jiang Ling felt programming till 70 is no problem. Demand is not such an obstacle. 
Jiang Ling felt nowadays there are many ways to do coding job at home.

I feel teaching might be good for me.

--no
Rahul put his heart into the job. I think my sister does that too.
My son might as well. I need to appreciate that.
I put my heart into theoretical learning, which I want to show my son 

--fuxi done 
enjoying the airport lounge food, I feel my kids would feel .... privileged?
But I don't want them to feel inferior when they don't have it. So perhaps the feeling of privilege is a double-edged sword, to be managed.

Perhaps we can't remove the sense of privilege or inferiority/deprivation

--fuxi x 3
perhaps I have an adjustment problem with negative feedback. 
The problem is my reaction to the feedback. 
I feel my sister and my son may be more effective. 

I feel I can do better. I can learn coping strategies. 
I can relax as grandpa suggested. 
I can learn to live in peace with the negative feedback. 
If I put in a reasonable effort and manager accepts it without a bonus, then I feel I can be happy. 
If I put in a reasonable effort but manager clearly indicates "unacceptable", then I feel i would take action to leave

Overall, my reaction to PIP is weaker than my reaction to IV setbacks. 
Traditionally, one of my strengths is positive attitude to IV setbacks. 
It is easy to look at the gap and feel hopeless.

Parenting also requires this capacity. [[Learned optimism]]] listed Permanent as one hallmark of pessimists.

The honeymoon of engagement (on coding drill, localSys, GTD, emailing to friends ..) is joy and pleasure in itself.
eg@engage: morning quiet time... the zone
eg@engage: on flights
eg@engage: weekend assignments

--intrinsic mtv is rather rare in most commercial domains
Arts (including fine arts..) are more likely. Personalized service (like nursing, counseling) also possible

--fuxi:
After reading A.Brooks, I assumed that grandpa's health would suffer if he loses relevance after retirement. 

He is very sure it won't happen. He said people in his circle basically keep working until physically unable. He foresees his life to be really busy for a few more years until his health prevents him from working. 

He actually believe his active workload at age 84 is harming his health. I feel irrelevance would be more detrimental to his health, but perhaps he has never thought of irrelevance.

--fuxi: I feel Indians have a problem with slim. I feel their culture associates slim with something negative, perhaps poverty?
In Chinese culture, I can see that BMI 19 is considered unattractive.
In reality, thinning is healthy for most people.

Likewise, I'm brainwashed to worship brank and overvalue work place interpersonal skills. I'm not good at them but I have something better -- ffree and easy-life (as QiChongLei puts it).
