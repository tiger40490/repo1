4 days into a week-long vacation, I start to feel the effect of deprivation/starvation of blogging. It is felt like a personal need similar to physical exercise, recreation. Interesting analogy -- starch. How many days can you go without starch before feeling deprived? 

I used blog for tech learning, introspection/reflection, diet management, etc. Deprivation means time availability (supply) falling from 3H to 30 minutes. I could tolerate a cut for a 3 days only.

--new blogpost: multiple layers of "protection" and buffer always gives me real sense of additional security
* eg: low BMI + pull up + fitness .. to protect against wellness "hazards". 
* eg: low visible fat on belly
* eg: SG and US as two job markets
* eg: west coast and wall st as two job markets
* eg: c++ in addition to java to provide livelihood
* eg: high fruit/veg low fat/starch diet .. to prepare for stress binge
* eg: plenty of spare time, rather than fully stretched .. to protect against spare time depletion
* eg: wife able to make a living
* eg: multiple passive incomes
* eg: MYS as additional retirement destination
* eg: multiple low-cost laptops
