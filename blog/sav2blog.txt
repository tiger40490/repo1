This blogpost touches on health, tcost and $cost.

The fact that I have low appetite for some addictive bad food (like sugary drinks or alcohol, fried finger foods, coffee) is more a blessing than a curse. 
I want to enjoy raw veg more.

The fact that I don't derive so much (addictive) pleasure from competitive gaming or gambling is more of a blessing than a curse. 
These games cost time, money and health.

As I age I derive less pleasure from movies and TV dramas (cf grandpa).
It now feels more like a curse than a blessing. 
ERE author also said that he derives less pleasure from a fancy restaurant meal as his cooking skill improves.

The fact that I don't derive so much pleasure from sight-seeing is more a blessing than a curse. 
Sight-seeing costs time and money. 
The consumerist mass media portray it as high pleasure but I only feel something cheap and shallow.
I find more pleasure in nearby natural sites like east coast.
--new: 
living with a few guys for the past few days in BGC (also including the 2015 trip), my advantages, my achievements, my distance ahead of the pack became evident

* BMI, belly
* diet
* exercise
* burn rate
* income
* job strain (not "stress" or "effort")
* career security 20Y out

In a bold extension, I would also include my Wall St peers. My burn rate is much lower partly due to Melvin3. As a hands-on developer, my income security is stronger than half the VPs. 

At a glance, most of my relative (not absolute) advantages lie in self-mgmt (I didn't say "self-restraint" or brute force willpower). Actually am not perfect ... there are some individuals with stronger willpower though they each has weaknesses in self-mgmt. When I find myself in a moment of weakness, I need to forgive and then accept myself, recognize this weakness as part of the human condition, and fight a bao3shan1 war, refusing to give up.

On the other hand, am not "effective" at achieving organizational goals. Those effective managers are often overweight, unfit, over-spending, failed in marriage, or over-dependent on the current employer and therefore lack portable skills. 

I feel leadership and persuasion powers are overrated because all the employer put these skills at center stage. 

Like the Cultural revolution, I have been brainwashed in countless corporate trainings (eg: OC) to believe that self-mgmt is secondary to organizational effectiveness

Q: why am I always apologetic and modest saying "ok I'm good at self-mgmt but I lack leadership, influencing, interpersonal". 

All of THOSE yardsticks are secondary to my life now (and more so as I age) and I actually have basic competency levels to do my professional job. 
Those skills are not the "内力" in kongfu novels.

This realization might be the beginning of an end to my lifelong self-pity, self-degrading, self-contempt about my leadership/ladder-climbing weaknesses.

--fuxi: "eco" in product brochures means -- energy efficient

--fuxi: do not remove usb cable from TV while transferring files.

--fuxi: endocrinology -- sounds like end of creek
--fuxi: tech xx on youtube
why my friends all prefer videos to reading text, even for tech xx
it requires less focused attention.
I feel most of them don't re-visit.

--new: ##rare achievements used as mere basic standard
I tend to feel inferior, self-hate... by benchmarkig against these rare achievements as if they are commonplace.

* grandpa's level of focus
* grandpa's level of diet control
* my diet control

--fuxi: gadget set-up anxiety
I tend to experience a lot of anxiety when I set up my new devices, esp. smart phone.

We all exeprience a growing dependency on gadgets. 
My dependency is due to efficiency ...
I use gadgets not only for communciations but as aux for brain.

Q: Can you live a day without this gadget?

--no hurry Q: am I avoiding the tough and high-leverage "burn" jobs?
* yoga ... is by far the toughest job... actually am taking on the challenge 
* jogging .. is more comfortable than yoga
* pull-up and push-up
* coding drill
(QQ is more comfortable than coding drill)
* BGC planning  -- am taking it on by talking to Raymond and Chun Tih. Not really high leverage.
* boy's math -- am taking it on
* work project and localSys xx -- am taking on some of the challenges. 
* FX robot? not so tough
* standing to work

--email to Miles: why I have a warm feeling for New York City
After hearing your first impression of NYC, I decided to take this opportunity to reflect why I have a warm feeling for the big apple.

Many Americans tell me NYC is full of energy.  There are many young people, and many events. They make me feel lively, not lonely. I certainly wish to see more Chinese faces. Luckily, some of those young people (and older guys) attracted to New  York City are actually Chinese. The three Chinatowns in NYC (Manhattan Chinatown, Flushing and eighth avenue) make me feel less isolated than in other U.S. cities.  Jersey City also has a large Chinese population, much higher than an average U.S. city.

NYC is more inclusive, more diverse, i.e.less white.

NYC offers more diverse job choices and education choices. Makes me feel less boxed in less restricted and more free.

I don't like car ownership and NYC is less car-dependent mostly due to the subway which runs 24-hours. NYC also has more buses than most US cities. 

Incomes are slightly higher in NYC than other U.S. cities. I feel lucky for that. Even though prices are also higher, I don’t usually buy anything in Manhattan. As a result, I get to save more in NYC than other cities. 

My family income is not high. Many "nicer" locations of U.S. are higher income. I actually feel poor living in those locations when my neighbors all earn higher. NYC has many low-income residents, and I feel not so left-out.
