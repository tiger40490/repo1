eg: accidental data usage -- waipo, grandma and me all did that with singtel prepaid card. It's a trap!
eg: starhub tv remote control : paid a channel by accident
eg: smrt card penalty
eg: retro fitness fee

Why i experience so much pain? I think I can learn to relax and accept just as I accepted many things in my life

--biggest problem with singtel prepaid card: accidental data usage
how do I block it permanently?

Over this hibernation period I could target
respect at work
diet habit, 
weight, 
boy's studies (benchmark++), 
net savings, 
fitness (yoga), 
coding drill (hard to measure)
QQ gain
...

qSG period I focused on some questionable targets (dnlg QQ, C++/c# trec, branch-out, renzi) and didn't feel fulfilled, probably due to PIP. I did achieve basic ffree

c++US period I had success with c++ trec, weight, yoga, coding drill, housing plan, but rather few visible progress.

Which do I prefer? #all relatively unbalanced, but realistic
Scenario 1: maintain the healthy weight (64kg) and diet; some respect; no visible progress esp. with boy

Scenario 2: QQ build-up, maintain c++critical mass, keep up coding drill, weight maintain at 66 kg but no other visible progress

Scenario 3: huge time on math without benchmark improvement; some respect; but no visible progress.

Scenario 4: some time on math without benchmark improvement; some respect; some QQ/codingDrill; weight back up to 67 - 70kg

--no blogpost: my current struggles #tectonic:
* boy's math? Is it my job or his job? In theory If I don't take any ownership then the pressure is completely off ... but realistically?
* [t] calorie count? I feel the Singapore climate adds 5 kg, even if my starch intake is halved 3 times
* yoga? now easier once I paid the membership fee :)
* figure-out-speed ] localSys
* [t?] CIV? LG2. How about review or simple problems?
* [t=tough struggle]

--as I age, more resources focused on wellness, parenting, per-investment, unfortunately less on tech xx

publishing from git-blog is multi-step -- create new blogpost (many clicks), tag, remove it from git-blog, commit then git-push

Better do it in batch

Similarly, relocating a blogpost is also multi-step.

intelligence, memory capacity, clear thinking, sharp perception ... can help the individual deal with depression and pessimism. I think most pessimistic thoughts are irrational and/or biased.

"Explanatory style" .. see [[learned optimism]]

"Mindfulness" is a therapy. This therapy can even cope with brain aging.

Memory is a muscle.. I think corrective thinking like my twister SMS is also a muscle one can improve by everyday training.
