--new: battery consumption after lid-close
for my Acer$299, battery depletion during idle time proved to be a real problem. John Tan (Simlim shop) told me to choose Sleep when lid closes.
I did as told since Dec 2019. It worked reasonably well in terms of battery saving and quick wake-up. The tiny LED goes red-off-red.. after I close the lid.

One drawback -- sometimes this LED goes blue-off-blue.. even with the lid closed. I have found that this basically means laptop failed to go to sleep.

Cause? unknown.

--update blogpost on not-left-behind 
Over the decades, I have slowly moved higher among my peers (very loosely defined).
* wellness
* dev-till-70 -- explanation needed: meaningful, engaging job. Low age discrimination. I am past my peak
* long-term cashflow -- burn rate + passive income
* SG citizenship -- carefree medical, housing,,,
* prestigious college -- vast majority of my friends can't match me

The brank is actually less meaningful than the career-total salary (CTS). 
* the managers have arguably shorter career
* I dont' really need higher lifelong total 

--fuxi: My mom, wife and friends used to say I don't take care of my hair, my shoes, my skin, my dress...
But look at those guys who do. These guys typically lack self-discipline and now show a belly, sluggish, affected by tabaco, alcohol,,,

Can they do 20 pull-up?

--fuxi: worst stressful period=2008-09
After boy was born, my stress profile deteriorated quickly over long and short term. T-budget strain.. heavy responsibility
I had no passive income  to supplement my salary,,, belt-tightening
My stress profile was significantly worse than 2006 in SG, despite my higher income. 

fear of job loss
I had no "multiple countries" to choose from. I fact I felt trapped and unwanted. I briefly considered quitting the U.S. returning to SG...
PIP was the main stressor
Salary was low -- actually a stressor since U.S. burn rate was much higher than in SG.
long commute from Brooklyn. Couldn't afford $2.5k rental in Jersey City.
Camp-out was a relief
java market depth as a parachute, cushion and safety net, was unavailable to me at that time.

when I criticize boy's unnecessary spend on fancy subway sandwich, I should remember my own "unnecessary" lunch-after-lunch.

Note boy's sandwich is relatively healthy by his standard.

I told a counselor that I would tell the 11 year old tanbin that "no one is perfect or powerful. Everyone of us is weak."

--new: micro-saving add up over 9Y
oth_risk

Majority of the people in my "home" cities waste numerous small amounts of money on a monthly basis. Over decades they "throw down the drain" a painful portion (like 10-20%) of their income.

Large number of small time-wastage is similar. We feel the pain only years later.

calorie-quota overconsumption is similar. We look back and feel the pain, sooner or later.

Among these ...., usable time is the most scarce, available up to age 60 or 55 for some.

Among these talents, the most significant (was $) is calorie-quota budgeting. It has long-term health benefits.

Among these endeavors, my success is most visible and decisive in $$, and least in time-saving

calorie-quota is a similar concept to carbon-quota. Each country each year is given a quota. If you over use then you need to borrow from the future quota.

--new: introspective: self-control: ctbz 寸土必争
(oth_risk. This blogpost needs a better title)
Aha! 寸土必争 is a daily struggle, tough for everyone. It's actually my competitive strength!

Once I set a (realistic) numerical target for my endeavor, I push myself to execute my plan with ruthless, clinical precision, semi-consciously beating up myself whenever I deviate visibly.

This attitude/habit is effective in some domains --
* Polyclinic dietitian .. without precision, calorie reduction will be futile
* Some people save for months then spend all the savings at year end
* my burn_rate_control (ffree) is the poster child success story
* quitting from substance addiction 
* focus on time utilization is a great example. Many people spend time (and $) in "fun" places that actually don't create a lot of pleasure.

However, with early rise, I feel my 寸土必争 attitude may not be necessary, possibly counterproductive.

weekly coding drill, daily yoga, daily workout ... don't need 寸土必争. Momentum is more important
