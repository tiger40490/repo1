* [:)] school problems.. Looking back at MSFM, i had very few problems. 
** Yixin?
* driving (parking) can generate more surprises than walking, sitting...
** car wear-n-tear 
* medical issues esp. with babies and aged -- inevitable
** :) sexual health issues are very common .. we are lucky
* [:)] exercise can generate many unpleasant surprises ... but lack of exercise lead to long-term wellness deterioration. 
** Also, exercise (incl yoga) make us feel stronger against other adversities
* loss of belongings 
* [:)] investment foes... my worries are proportional to the exposure. I have coped well with them so far .. personal strength
* [:)] immigration problems .. so far I handled them well .. personal strength
* credit card -- credit score, missed payment...a necessary evil
* consumer technology (gadgets, services) can generate frustrations, regrettable buys ... complexity.. a necessary evil
* [:)] job search setbacks -- my big strength, a parachute giving me lots of confidence and freedom from care
* annual appraisal .. turned out to be my #1 heaviest Blow/stigma/fear
