when I criticize boy's unnecessary spend on fancy subway sandwich, I should remember my own "unnecessary" lunch-after-lunch.

Note boy's sandwich is relatively healthy by his standard.

I told a counselor that I would tell the 11 year old tanbin that "no one is perfect or powerful. Everyone of us is weak."

--new: micro-saving add up over 9Y

Majority of the people in my "home" cities waste numerous small amounts of money on a monthly basis. Over decades they "throw down the drain" a painful portion (like 10-20%) of their income.

Large number of small time-wastage is similar. We feel the pain only years later.

calorie-quota overconsumption is similar. We look back and feel the pain, sooner or later.

Among these ...., usable time is the most scarce, available up to age 60 or 55 for some.

Among these talents, the most significant (was $) is calorie-quota budgeting. It has long-term health benefits.

Among these endeavors, my success is most visible and decisive in $$, and least in time-saving

calorie-quota is a similar concept to carbon-quota. Each country each year is given a quota. If you over use then you need to borrow from the future quota.

--introspective: self-control: 寸土必争
(oth_risk. This blogpost needs a better title)

Once I set a (realistic) numerical target for my endeavor, I push myself to execute my plan with ruthless precision, semi-consciously beating up myself whenever I deviate visibly.

This attitude/habit is effective in some domains --
* Polyclinic dietitian .. without clinical precision, calorie reduction will be futile
* Some people save for months then spend all the savings at year end
* my burn_rate_control (ffree) is the poster child success story
* quitting from substance addiction 
* focus on time utilization is a great example. Many people spend time (and $) in "fun" places that actually don't create a lot of pleasure.

However, with early rise, I feel my 寸土必争 attitude may not be necessary, possibly counterproductive.

weekly coding drill, daily yoga, daily workout ... don't need 寸土必争. Momentum is more important

--jolt:
my introspective self-discovery is iterative, self-correcting and endless like editing a wikipedia article. 
I don't feel very effective because there are always too many things I don't understand about myself...

However, I never feel inferior (hopeless compared to "them") as felt in yoga, coding practice, or moving-up

--jolt: pay to enter a marathon?
Mr ERE would not spend that money. Presumably he would not spend on yoga classes, packaged salad or fancy fruits.

Reality is, spending money on these things do improve my health. If you ask me to DIY at home, I know I would fail due to limited self-discipline or drive.

in SG k-12 schools, i quickly had a deep and complete feeling that no local student was bold, innovative like me, and all were too conformable and compliant.

In hind sight, I can see that some small percentage of local students were unconventional like me, but they didn't want to show it.

* foreign students in local schools -- In local schools, there are also many foreign students, but I consider Malaysian students local.
* non-local schools -- I would guess in international schools the culture would be more diverse, with students from far away or developed countries
* Singapore students educated overseas -- some of them are not so conformable.
* university instead of 1-12 -- I found more local students like me
* At the workplace -- many local graduates are not so conformable.

--the 2 recurring pains captured in my blogs
1) PIP
2) peer comparison -- such as left-behind, brank (but how about beautiful wife, wellness, edu credentials)

Now I can name the 3rd recurring pain -- boy's current (rather than longer-horizon) academic situation, such as (but not limited to) motivation level and time-mgmt

--fuxi: bindi's suggestion:
look in the mirror and tell yourself "You are good enough".

--no blog
If no kids, then I feel I would have won the war against FOMO and pretty much all the battles I care to fight.

If no wife, then I would have won more completely more comfortably.
