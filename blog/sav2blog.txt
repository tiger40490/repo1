--The annoyances can grow into stressors. Therefore, it's best to tackle these challenges when not under stress

* bofa credit balance cheques
* retrofitness extra charges
* tax filing
* repairs

What kinda buffer would be really effective? 
* consistent coding drill
* consistent jogging, yoga and strength training
* time-off
* short commute
* evening/weekend flexible work hours
* adequate rest including sleep
* movies?

-- good to review my reactions to random adversities
* trespass
* credit history

--no blog:I'm tuned in to myself. I think the current driver is spare time utilization, or the zsms thereof.

Burn/rot is mostly materialistic pursuit + self-discipline ... martyrdom?

In the typical weekend, median hours spent on 'burn' is about 2 hour such as tech xx, localSys, workout or academic coaching
In the most 'burn' weekend, I can hit 10-20 hour, never 40 hours
This weekend I have achieved
* gate skirt -- lots of time, research, tweaking, and courage in the face of uncertainty.
* math coaching incl meimei
* friday jogging , chin-up
* diet control

To satisfy that driver (and that judge) I push myself to jogging or office

cognitive sms-therapy: 
I need to drive home the sms "the gate fixture has big impact on family wellbeing". No hurry and I don't want to hire a contractor just for it. 
I have spare time so this is a good use of my spare time.
I can derive a bit of joy

What's strategic -- 
localsys? No
stretch? Yes but no power surge in that space
coach my son on wordy problems? No 
coach my son on self-discipline and confidence? possibly

====new: martyrdom 
martyrdom is fundamentally connected to my burn/rot concept

-- Origin of this word -- One who voluntarily suffers death as the penalty for refusing to renounce their religion

-- idealist purity 
By my standard, every human is lazy, weak, loser

--no pain no gain -- is A related phrase. I addressed this point when a MorganStanley colleague described my extreme diet as self-discipline (more like self-restraint). I said deprivation is unsustainable.

--update blogpost on won the war on folb
at my age now, I am beginning to feel mellowing up about my position among my former peers(Shiyan etc). When I hear of their brank, I feel slightly less ashamed. The self-confidence, self-assurance is beginning to emerge. I'm slowly coming to terms with my current status, as Kyle Stewart put it.

Brank really boils down to income (+ asset to a lesser extent). At my age now, I don't need higher salary. More important than higher income are wellness, cash flow, , ,

I think as we age, my advantages (wellness, SG citizenship, long horizon cash-flow confidence...) and my peers' disadvantages (career longevity etc) will become more visible.

Remember [[Brad's status]] 

Incredibly, am now beginning to feel somewhat comfortable about my position. I don't feel totally uncomfortable as I did over the last 10 years. Such an improvement was unthinkable for practically my entire adult life. 
Given the repeated setbacks, I have always felt thoroughly defeated on the ladder climbing contest. It was a game I am not good at.

I told XR that his perception and bench-marking was irrational against the web2.0 developers. In the mirror, I saw myself comparing with my ladder-climbing "peers", irrationally. They are not my peers acutally.

--update blogpost on not-left-behind 
Over the decades, I have slowly moved higher among my peers (very loosely defined).
* wellness
* dev-till-70 -- explanation needed: meaningful, engaging job. Low age discrimination. I am past my peak
* long-term cashflow -- burn rate + passive income
* SG citizenship -- carefree medical, housing,,,
* prestigious college -- vast majority of my friends can't match me
Many of these "high fliers" are 能挣会花 just like a young guy overeating + heavy workout. But age is aginst him. Can he cut down on his burn rate (overeating) as his earning capacities declines

The brank is actually less meaningful than the career-total salary (CTS). 
* the managers have arguably shorter career
* I dont' really need higher lifelong total

at my age now, am more focused on cutting daily calories than cutting daily expenses.

belt-tightening is my traditional strength

--new: profit lock-in
when I notice a self-efficacy/aborbency/// "power surge", when I feel so powerful that I could overcome anything... I had better stop to ask myself "which tough jobs are becoming Spicy?". We had better aim to capture that power and lock in a "profit".

[15%] occasionally the wrong-time temptation becomes clearly more manageable as I feel more in control of my appetite.

[21%] Sometimes I get in the mood for localSys or company projects. Should consider camp-out.

Frequently, jogging becomes physicaly enjoyable (30%) or at least sustainable (60%). It's dangerous to expect this "peak" to last. Danger in terms of disappointment.

[25%] Sometimes coding drill gathers momentum and become sustainable on a weekly basis. Enjoyable is rarer like 5%.

[9%] Once a while my internal resistance to chin-up or yoga home-practice improves so much that I could do it on a Daily basis, but it seldom stays at that optimal level.

[19%] Sometimes my patience/capacity and ... for word problem coaching improves. This /space/ is a high-stake game, and remains highly unstable as I continue to lose grip and experience limited self-understanding. This is now the most challenging domain.

--fuxi: worst stressful period=2008-09
After boy was born, my stress profile deteriorated quickly over long and short term. T-budget strain.. heavy responsibility
I had no passive income  to supplement my salary,,, belt-tightening
My stress profile was significantly worse than 2006 in SG, despite my higher income. 

fear of job loss
I had no "multiple countries" to choose from. I fact I felt trapped and unwanted. I briefly considered quitting the U.S. returning to SG...
PIP was the main stressor
Salary was low -- actually a stressor since U.S. burn rate was much higher than in SG.
long commute from Brooklyn. Couldn't afford $2.5k rental in Jersey City.
Camp-out was a relief
java market depth as a parachute, cushion and safety net, was unavailable to me at that time.

when I criticize boy's unnecessary spend on fancy subway sandwich, I should remember my own "unnecessary" lunch-after-lunch.

Note boy's sandwich is relatively healthy by his standard.

I told a counselor that I would tell the 11 year old tanbin that "no one is perfect or powerful. Everyone of us is weak."

--new: micro-saving add up over 9Y
oth_risk

Majority of the people in my "home" cities waste numerous small amounts of money on a monthly basis. Over decades they "throw down the drain" a painful portion (like 10-20%) of their income.

Large number of small time-wastage is similar. We feel the pain only years later.

calorie-quota overconsumption is similar. We look back and feel the pain, sooner or later.

Among these ...., usable time is the most scarce, available up to age 60 or 55 for some.

Among these talents, the most significant (was $) is calorie-quota budgeting. It has long-term health benefits.

Among these endeavors, my success is most visible and decisive in $$, and least in time-saving

calorie-quota is a similar concept to carbon-quota. Each country each year is given a quota. If you over use then you need to borrow from the future quota.

--new: introspective: self-control: ctbz 寸土必争
(oth_risk. This blogpost needs a better title)
Aha! 寸土必争 is a daily struggle, tough for everyone. It's actually my competitive strength!

Once I set a (realistic) numerical target for my endeavor, I push myself to execute my plan with ruthless, clinical precision, semi-consciously beating up myself whenever I deviate visibly.

This attitude/habit is effective in some domains --
* Polyclinic dietitian .. without precision, calorie reduction will be futile
* Some people save for months then spend all the savings at year end
* my burn_rate_control (ffree) is the poster child success story
* quitting from substance addiction 
* focus on time utilization is a great example. Many people spend time (and $) in "fun" places that actually don't create a lot of pleasure.

However, with early rise, I feel my 寸土必争 attitude may not be necessary, possibly counterproductive.

weekly coding drill, daily yoga, daily workout ... don't need 寸土必争. Momentum is more important
