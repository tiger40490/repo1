lesson learnt on this flights
15H flight is tolerable on my body
4H sleep before 15H was insufficient to keep me awake
diet? not so strict but OK
no movie -- I did it twice in a row but it may become tough. This time I had plenty of motivation to read java, [[pearls]].
no need to feel guilty about coding drill
I conceived many worthwhile thoughts about career, parenting, .. 
I relied heavily on laptop but perhaps phone+fake finger might be more convenient -- easier to charge, less bulky. For lengthy writing, laptop wins

--3 todo's for Mark
1) simple question -- which c++ library would you use to implement an http endpoint
2) comment on Liquid API. No obligation no hurry
3) any github content to share. I don't need to struggle here. I can send him a zipped copy of some of my stuff in py, perl or java. I don't need to show any c++ as it may create an impression

--new blogpost: highRiskHighReturn #Jill
AsiaPropertyDev has  current campaignn to pay 20% in Y1, 21% in Y2 ... 24% in Y5 if client commits 50k. Last payment is 50k * 1.24.

I told Jill this contractual return is too high and a sign of desperation but Jill said CEO adjusts campaign features constantly.

I shared with Jill my observation -- once a while a reputble company disrupts a mature market with drastically reduced cost to customers and captures huge market share

Q (Ri): what c++14/17/19 features do you use?
Q: what c++ ide do you use?
Q: what's your build system? Clion?
Q: what's unqiue about your integrated feed?
Q: what if some clients subscribe by a slow internet connection and your orderbook feed need to provide delta updates each time a client reconnects?
Q: given a random string of bracket openers/closers, write a bool function to determine if it's balanced
..  every closer must follow its matching opener
%%A: Now I feel no stack needed. Just use an int to keep count of unclosed brackets. but a stack is more versatile

Q: how do the 8 threads in your parser manage the 48 channels?
%%A: each thread only knows about the 6 channels -- publisher/retrans/refresh on Line A and B. Hardcoded affinity

Q5: in your work do you use any external libraries
%%A: I know enough STL, but this project doesn't use any heap allocation. Some projects use a lot of boost libraries.

Q5b: in that case how would you implement a basic http endpoint?
%%A: I would write it in python, c# or java
Q5c: but all of your data and functions are in c++
%%A: I would use socket api, but I agree this is such a common task that there must be a number of libraries

Q: any interaction with the matching engine team?

Q: name some examples of mistakes they made in the beginning?

Q: Have you considered FPGA?

Q: any github profile?

Most of the time, interviewers find candidate's experience too high-level, but Mark actually felt I lack experience using high-level libraries

I feel contrary to what he says, most emplyers appreciate low-level coding capabilities .. more precious

--new blogpost: 45-min commute when living with/out family
After my son was born in NY, my 50-minute commute (Hamilton) vs 35-min commute (Newport) felt very differnt
1-hr commute feels OK at mvea because ... no family and low workload
living with family, i predict i would again feel a big difference of 15 min change in commute

Many people feel such a prediction is highly unreliable, but I feel past experience is very reliable

staying with family, I get basically no time for study and very limited time for blogging.. about 5hr/week but I need 20-40 hr/week !!

--healthy diet tips given by SG HPB #orange
recommended -- sugar substitutes; sugar-free drinks; Chinese tea
orange is safe even though not leanest. Orange is not as low-cal as some veg but Singapore HPB (and many experts would agree) picked orange as the safest food.

Not a bad thing that i didn't buy a 2nd hdb home under gm or sister's name. 
rental yield would be much lower than cambodia,
and now we know some of these old HDB units can depreciate.

Likewise, Maybe it would be good to avoid a 4th Cambodia shop
