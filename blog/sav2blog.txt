4 days into a week-long vacation, I start to feel the effect of deprivation/starvation of blogging. It is felt like a personal need similar to physical exercise, recreation. Interesting analogy -- starch. How many days can you go without starch before feeling deprived? 

I used blog for tech learning, introspection/reflection, diet management, etc. Deprivation means time availability (supply) falling from 3H to 30 minutes. I could tolerate a cut for a 3 days only.
