--grandpa said I need to slow down in speaking

--the 2 recurring pains captured in my blogs
1) PIP
2) peer comparison -- such as left-behind, brank (but how about beautiful wife, wellness, edu credentials)

Now I can name the 3rd recurring pain -- boy's current (rather than longer-horizon) academic situation, such as (but not limited to) motivation level and time-mgmt

--bindi's suggestion:
look in the mirror and tell yourself "You are good enough".
