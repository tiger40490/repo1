--no blogpost:
so far, during this Memorial trip, I had no motivation (beside the interviews) to study. 

If you ask me why, I feel too distracted by my son's academic situation. This one concern alone acts like a sponge, absorbing all my spare time and mental energy

A 2nd "distraction" is blogging about job change (big decision), stress level etc

multiple layers of "protection" always makes me feel secure
* eg: low BMI + pull up + fitness .. to protect against wellness "hazards". 
* eg: high fruit/veg low fat/starch diet .. to protect against stress binge
* eg: plenty of spare time, rather than fully stretched .. to protect against spare time depletion
* eg: wife able to make a living
* eg: multiple passive incomes
* eg: c++ in addition to java to provide livelihood
* eg: multiple low-cost laptops
