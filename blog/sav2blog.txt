--the 2 recurring pains captured in my blogs
1) PIP
2) peer comparison -- such as left-behind, brank (but how about beautiful wife, health, edu credentials)

Now I can name the 3rd recurring pain -- boy's current (rather than longer-horizon) academic situation, such as (but not limited to) motivation level and time-mgmt

--new: better blog post titles:
catchy phrases
sharp questions

It requires time and mental energy to create and improve blog titles. They help organize my thoughts on a complex and challenging subject such as parenting or diet. Such a subject may hit 200 blogposts, so without effective organization lots of content become effectively lost.

--new: amidst the demands, focus on protecting
* protect my precious job -- the numerous precious features
* protect family harmony -- boy's PSLE is one of the biggest threats
* protect my current wellness condition -- diet, exercise,,,, demands time + absorbency

For these protections, I'm willing to spend more money (not tcost) like tutors, family outings

? protect my carefree cash-flow -- the BGC situation is not yet carefree
? protect my interview readiness? I think I will NOT lose it so soon.

--new: effective text highlighting in git-blog etc
* most versatile is __connected_underline__
* color, bold, font size, strike-through
* underline -- available in web blog only, but confusing (hyperlink)
* italics -- hardly noticeable on its own. Need to combine with other highlighting

--new:
nicknames for my devices, for git commit msg and other purposes
"hp"
"a299"
