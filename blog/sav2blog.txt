again, i feel overwhelmed by 
* SG19
* diet, yoga
* work projects -- lucky am a contractor
* trespass charge
* long commute
* .. but luckily
* no health condition like in Jan 2018
* no horrible boss like in Jan 2018

--new blogpost: commute becomes a real pain when stressors stack up
Case: in Apr 2019 the trespass case triggered the reaction and I just wanted to stay home.

Other stressors likely to trigger the same overwhelmed reaction
* kids studies
* health issues within family
* work projects
* car problems
* investment failures
* immigration issues

When I get the mtv for coding drill, i can sacrifice diet, sleep or yoga, but not a billable day.
when I get the mtv for QQ including algoQQ and coding experiments, I can sacrifice sleep but not yoga

--no blogpost: lesson learned on this flight
15H flight is tolerable on my body though shorter would be less taxing
diet? is all about abstinence. not so strict but reasonably good. Removed fried content:)

no need to feel guilty about coding drill. The less guilt the better for my system. The guilt is completely counterproductive and unfair

I conceived many worthwhile thoughts about career, parenting, .. High Fertility flight

I relied heavily on laptop but perhaps phone+fake finger might be more convenient -- easier to charge, less bulky. 
However for lengthy writing, laptop wins
