Kyle asked "what do you want your son to grow up like?" I said I want him to be good at something, not competitively per se.

Kyle pointed out I'm good at tech stuff (I would say not competitively.) I would say I'm good at pushing myself on diet, regular exercise, study. 
Am also good at lifelong study, like my dad. 
Am also good at conserver lifestyle and cash-flow management.

Any of these are positive qualities I want to see in my son.

perhaps I have an adjustment problem -- frequently I outperform in IV to set up expectation, but on the job struggle to match it, and receive negative feedback. 
The problem is my reaction to the feedback. 
I feel my sister and my son may be more effective. 

I feel I can do better. I can learn coping strategies. 
I can relax as grandpa suggested. 
I can learn to live in peace with the negative feedback. 
If I put in a reasonable effort and manager accepts it without a bonus, then I feel I can be happy. 
If I put in a reasonable effort but manager clearly indicates "unacceptable", then I feel i would take action to leave

Overall, my reaction to PIP is weaker than my reaction to IV setbacks. 
Traditionally, one of my strengths is positive attitude to IV setbacks. 
It is easy to look at the gap and feel hopeless.

Parenting also requires this capacity. [[Learned optimism]]] listed Permanent as one hallmark of pessimists.

The honeymoon of engagement (on coding drill, localSys, GTD, emailing to friends ..) is joy and pleasure in itself.
eg@engage: morning quiet time... the zone
eg@engage: on flights

git-blogging is not perfect. print-out is more accessible. Lower friction.

4 days into a week-long vacation, I start to feel the effect of deprivation/starvation of blogging. It is felt like a personal need similar to physical exercise, recreation.
Interesting analogy -- starch. How many days can you go without starch before feeling deprived? 

I used blog for tech learning, introspection/reflection, diet management, etc. Deprivation means time availability (supply) falling from 3H to 30 minutes. I could tolerate a cut for 3 days only.

Q: how do I get more quiet time while living with family?  Note I need more quiet time than other fathers. I suffer more from the family distractions. 

I need quiet time for thinking/blogging about
* investment
* wellness planning and management
* many many non-trivial decisions
* managing other stressful items

Depending on the specific task on my plate, I will find ... "alternatives" since quiet time is simply insufficient compared to my NY days.

Sugg: stay in office longer, better in early morning but in the evening by default 
sugg: Friday evening is golden. Other parts of the weekend can also be valuable
Sugg: take half-day leaves to create half-day quiet periods at home. This feature isn't available to contractor
Sugg: yo-yo diet on tech xx -- when we get the quiet time (in the mood or not), learn as much as possible.
Sugg: On some days, sleep early and catch earlier trains so I can study on trains; On other days, stay up late for quiet hours at night

After reading A.Brooks, I assumed that grandpa's health would suffer if he loses relevance after retirement. 

He is very sure it won't happen. He said people in his circle basically keep working until physically unable. He foresees his life to be really busy for a few more years until his health prevents him from working. 

He actually believe his active workload at age 84 is harming his health. I feel irrelevance would be more detrimental to his health, but perhaps he has never thought of irrelevance.

--fuxi: I feel Indians have a problem with slim. I feel their culture associates slim with something negative, perhaps poverty?
In reality, thinning is healthy for most people.

Likewise, I'm brainwashed to worship brank and overvalue work place interpersonal skills. I'm not good at them but I have something better -- ffree and easy-life (as QiChongLei puts it).
