--new: gadget set-up anxiety
I tend to experience a lot of anxiety when I set up my new devices, esp. smart phone.

We all exeprience a growing dependency on gadgets. 
My dependency is due to efficiency ...
I use gadgets not only for communications but as aux for brain.

Q: Can you live a day without this gadget?
