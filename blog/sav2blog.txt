multiple layers of "protection" always makes me feel secure
* eg: low BMI + pull up + fitness .. to protect against wellness "hazards". 
* eg: high fruit/veg low fat/starch diet .. to protect against stress binge
* eg: plenty of spare time, rather than fully stretched .. to protect against spare time depletion
* eg: wife able to make a living
* eg: multiple passive incomes
* eg: c++ in addition to java to provide livelihood
