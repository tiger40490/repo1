--new new blogpost speed-reading^slow-digestion@legacy code
speed-reading (Understanding big/small program quickly) ... is my competitive weakness, but once I understand a codebase I am often more proficient (and deeper, more complete grasp) than co-workers, capable of precision laser surgery :)

Andrew Yap, Ashish Singh, ... all faster speed reading.

I need to take many notes and refresh them, but still poor retention rate.

Debugging my own code is easier than debugging other people's code. This is more obvious for me than other guys

As part of ECT capacity in speed coding... if I have to read lengthy error messages, I'm slower than other guys. That's why I prefer python.
