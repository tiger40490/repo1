--new jolt: I am so used to measuring roti in terms of gz including tech xx and work projects, but i was always philosophical about income

As I age, it is fundamental to increase the weightage on wellness, parenting, taking care of grandparents, marriage ...

For wellness, the huge effort may not produce visible effect !

As to parenting efforts, again huge tcost but slow improvement

--new: late night working (not blogging) in office
Consider working past midnight if in the mood. Usually can come in late next morning

This is so rare that I don't need to think so much.

J4 #1: capture the honeymoon
J4 #2: discuss with U.S. and make progress
j4 #3: avoid the family dinner temptation. Not a major issue for this month, but will become very real very soon.
sacrifice #: can't help boy on math.. hopefully can do it in the afternoon session
sacrifice #: family time
sacrifice #: yoga
sacrifice #2: early sleep, early rise routine

9 "stubborn" diet HABITS ranked in terms of impact on my long-term health

:) don't eat if not hungry, even when everyone is eating. My parents and in-laws believed we should all eat at the same time. Some people eat dinner early and don't feel hungry at night, but my body is different
:) self-restraint on oily, fried food , despite my nature
:) skip breakfast + lunch
:) delayed dinner
:( heavy supper after 11pm in my younger days
:( heavy afternoon snacks of nuts, starch ..
:) no coffee or sugary drink habit, despite peer influence 
:) raw veg salad to break starch dependency
:) spot the visible fat. I believe every tidbit counts. I hate paying such high calorie "price" to gain basically nothing.
:( cake-history buns once a day -- once formed, this habit was hard to break

--new: improve tolerance of raw veg
A G3 benefit/j4 eating raw veg is that it slowly strengthens my tolerance of these extremely healthy foods.

This tolerance goes a long towards lifelong healthy diet habits

If I can tolerate celery, red cabbage etc, then I can basically eat all other raw veg.

--new: feeling superior in wellness
Q: do I feel superior in my wellness esp. BMI, diet, yoga practice, freedom from illness?
My endeavors therein are harder than IV muscle building. 
I do feel proud (even superior) in my c++/java QQ, my career longevity, my lifelong learning capacity and habit. 

Should I feel the same about wellness? I should. This is arguably more strategic more valuable. My wellness achievement is now taking more effort more discipline than the other achievements..

I also feel superior in my burn rate, passive income, retirement plan and Fuller wealth.

If I have the right priorities (as the BBC Multiple Sclerosis patient put it) , then I probably should feel superior more often about wellness than about my tech skills.

--new: stretch: too-easy^too-hard
yoga is much harder than jogging.

As I told Rahul, I am unable to find a mid point between
* too tough, painful, ... to practice on my own
* too easy and no effect, wasting my time. This includes most of the easy stretches including warrior stances, cat, bow, fish, twist, side bends.

In fact, in both cases I fail to see any lasting improvement. Promethean torment.

Q: How about jogging? Revealing question, worth 64-million-dollars! 
A: I could see my fitness maintained.

Q: So why am i not seeing my flexibility maintained?
Huge mis-perception
Blatant double-standard

I think i need a new way to measure my result and progress. 
With this new yardstick, i hope to reboot my yoga practice.

A more realistic home practice regime:
* celebrate (reward) the small achievements esp. the maintenance
* avoid the hard stretches completely as they generate self-hate, defeat, frustration,...
* aim at 1 minute of easy stretches. If a hard stretch feels easy then go for it. 
* Yin-yoga? avoid if it takes too much time, and generate anxiety etc
