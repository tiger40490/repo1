j4 using multiple browser brands .. if you are comfortable with a single browser brand (say, Chrome) rather than multiple browser brands, then the impact of Chrome issue is more scary, more stressful, requires more painful adjustments.

if I preclear a lot for a day, but later find myself in a power surge for math session or something else, then the pressure to do something about the pre-cleared stock is an unwanted distraction.

-- slow update sReit
I feel sReit is more transparent than usReit, largely due to the nanny state regulation.

The sReit operators are all well-known. Many of them are government-linked. As such, they are very low-risk in terms of govenance.

There are relatively few variations (a form of cognitive complexity) among the sReits. Very similar business models.

There are two important quadrants:  HighIncome_LowWealth, and LowIncome_HighWealth

The traditional Chinese tend to save and invest (Earn/Save/Invest) and become fairly wealthy.

-- update git-bash
intuitive copy-paste is more important than I thought
right-click to paste. Can be non-intuitive to some, but easy to discover, and easy to learn
shift-insert is a built-in hotkey for paste. Worth learning.

git-diff red_text_on_black is horrible default .. I am trying Dracula. Large text size also helps.

blinking cursor .. block cursor is nicer on my eyes than a thin bar, and a more visual indicator of the window of focus.

After assigning hotkey F2 to SaveAll, we need to identify hotkey conflicts. This is better done using the search bar at bottom of the pop-up.
Without this tool, the conflict used to add to the legwork and pschological stress.

I prefer a constant-width font. Easier to line up indent across multiple lines
I prefer font size 12

-- update "yoga4life"
at twice a week, the total hours would be 3 to 5 /wk, based on my Bayonne experience. This is much more than the hours I can allocate to all other workouts combined. Therefore, the tcost is unsustainable.

Reality is, yoga isn't life-saving like kidney dialysis that must be performed weekly. Most guys are unable to do 3 sessions/week and therefore 3 sessions/week is unrealistic for most people, just like 5 workouts/week.Â 

The sustainable tcost has to be based on self-practice.

-- update blogpost on workout priorities https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/10950/bmi-flexible-cre-strength/
.. the need to balance enjoyments with wellness priorities 
some people (mostly men) enjoy muscle training and nothing else .. I think some  Americans do. It can affect BMI and flexibility, two of the most important aspects of wellness. I am unlikely to become bulky, but flexibility is a traditionally neglected area.

some people enjoy jogging and nothing else. It can lead to loss of flexibility and muscle as we age.

Some women do mostly yoga including some limited strength training, so they lack CRE. Therefore, some combine yoga with cardio. 

Ideally, you would want to enjoy a range of workouts, but few individuals are so lucky. For every adult and child, consistent workout is repetitive and requires a lot of effort and absorbency. Team sports and golf are more fun but requires a lot of external help.

t_intro
Why is fitness class easier than self-practice?
Self-practice requires constant SMS, constant motivating (like dRam refresh), constant push beyond the comfort zone. Lots of system2 work.
For example, after a rest we need System 2 to decide when to restart, set a target and keep count.
In a class, we can relax System2 and follow the instructor and other students. System 1 is efficient.

Remember the Bayonne yoga class led by the Russian student? I didn't like her instruction but still I followed.

If it's a video, then I would not be able to "just follow it"

biggest time-consuming procedures that require focus focus

#1 ice .. sugg make ice in office and bring home
.. worry: spill while putting in .. sugg: use tight boxes
.. worry: melt too fast if outside
.. worry: some ice chunks get stuck and wasted .. sugg: ignore them, and refill the box.
.. worry: ice melting in blender if left too long .. sugg: leave ice in blender and wait only without liquid.
.. sugg: use smaller ice bags. Can fit into the other drawers.
#2 carving out avocado
.. worry: wasting.. Sugg discard more of the avocado
.. worry: contamination

--new time won't stand still
The last weekend of Oct 2021, I put in many hours 
* to add visualization
* to add more tests

Why? What's the motivation, j4 and ROTI? I asked the same question about MSFM, C#, Swing, quant self-study, python... I still don't have a good analytical framework. 

Key observation -- time won't stand still. It keeps flowing at a constant rate. Time can't be warehoused. If I don't spend my time on this coding practice, I would easily "waste" it on one of the energy sinks.

This coding drill has multiple benefits in hindsight
* the visualization emboldened me to engage Deepak, Daryl, Josh Lim, even my son. The "engagement" further enhances my "learning" .. various aspects
* my visualization is now barely usable for the "engagement", but if it is unusable, then my effort would still be a worthwhile effort. It reminds me of my pre-sales effort, my self-employment days... 
* I had a blogpost about  weekends otherwise wasted: G3 ROI@UChicago. Even if the code doesn't work, this is still zqbx. Without this zqbx, my ezlife feels decadent, wasteful and an incomplete success. 

My friends' effort and my own effort were not in vein. It restored my self-confidence as a c++ developer. The self-confidence is priceless.

NoSql is bigData, not DS/ML. 

Data Science probably favors python or R. ML is even less suitable for java.
ML includes classification, recommendation, ,, NeuralNetwork is part of ML

-- new: 2022 review: techBets, TSN
Most of my techBets and tsn ... are likely to pay lower dividends after first 10Y. 
I will receive the dividend when I change job  back to the target domain, be it bondMath, mkt data, sockets, SQL or Perl,,,

Strategic orgro is a holy grail.

We all have to be discretionary, cautious in our positioning.
I spend lots of time blogg about this.
Despite the underwhelming results of my techBets and tsn, we must not give up.
Applicable to Singapore government too. 
We need to decide what tech to take up and what to put off.

For the last 15Y, finDev IV is my chose game.
The 3 types of dnlg are still relevant.

-- slow-cooking new wiki^recoll
Active scratchpads can be implemented as a wiki, or a file in a recoll directory tree.

A wiki (including my blog) is first and foremost an info display system, so you can keep a page open forever, as one of 20 open browser tabs. You can start an hour-long edit session, but eventually, you will save and publish. Most of the time the document is in Published mode, not Edit mode.

A recoll is data storage. The Edit GUI and Display GUI are the same thing, not separate. Therefore, we don't display a recoll file forever because there is a real risk of unwanted edit when we don't know how to roll back.

A recoll has more flexible organization. A wiki tree is kinda similar, but my blog is not. My blog relies on categories and tags
