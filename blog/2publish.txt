--new (open): G9 improvements since Sep 2019
Note I want focus more on effort less on results

family dinner skipped most of the time

early sleep, early rise

more raw veg than any years before

yoga

starch -- quit rice for 2 months

"defocus" list in office + noHurry list at home

soaking/drafting in gitblog

cake history habit

late dinner habit

ice cream -- now buying small pieces not in bulk

quit heavy snacking in office
boy math - preparation is more efficient than facetime
.. beyond G9 
weight hasn't gone back to q3sg levels
blogging on commute; 
home-made milkshake
temptations identified -- wrong food, wrong time, wrong qty
blog: prefer bulk operations
paid off BGC
helped a few friends with coding tests

--research then publish: Q: if I declare a huge int array in static memory, will the object file become huge?

This is possibly a QQ nlg pearl, a halo zbs, not GTD
