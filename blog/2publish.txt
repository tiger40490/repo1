-- new: Jack Zhang on parenting
高压 discipline ..

Observe what the kid wants and fulfill his needs.

keep the communication open as they go through adolescence. 

Accept some variations in individual personalities.

Curiosity is a good thing in a kid.

..JackZ on my family migration
U.S. migration might be more risky for your kids then for you

Make sure you still have enough time for your kids when you are working here.

Parent's time is a key factor in Raymond's success story.

JackZ: If you feel your son is likely to become a manager type, then perhaps the wordy problem skills (abstract logical skills) are not really relevant in the long run. Self-confidence is arguably more important.

Both Jack and grandpa foresee that my derogatory remarks could easily damage boy's confidence.  I use such harsh words to get his attention, but apparently the net effect is counterproductive. Jack suggested -- paste reminder on your computer, in your cockpit, on the mirror ... to remind yourself.

Given the lack of interest in wordy problems, U.S. culture would probably emphasize encouragement not forced practice.

--new: dabao's absorbency4作文 ibt...
In my P6, I too hated Chinese compo but I was more focused on the marks.
I think boy's absorbency for Chinese compo is better than many boys in my P6 class.

--new jolt: Genn's discussion
I often show my lack of confidence in his abilities , his luck, his future progress, ,, it would affect him. 

for math, More nurturing less demanding; instead of telling him what to do, suggest to him.

Rebuild his self-esteem and confidence in math.

He doesn't show all his cards. He may have some special skills; he may feel ashamed sometimes.

Get boy to finish the toughest homework early, before dinner, to fend off the fearful math teacher.

Consider stopping the Science/Eng tuition. It is counter-productive to developing his motivation and self responsibility.

--new: what motivates me to punish ah-boy
jolt: I told dabao that love him. That's sincere. But at times I really want him to feel punished and fearful. 

I feel I am enduring and sacrificing so much. I want him to feel my pain and suffering.

--new bolt: US: #1 risk to boy
perhaps drugs (sex, youth gangs) in U.S. but in such environments, the bigger risk to the family is my health and stable marriage.

As a parenting coach said, if a kid has mom + dad together, then any risk would be mitigated.

--new: confrontation with boy=high-stake game
confrontation with boy is a dangerous decision. Once I make a stance (wisely or unwisely) it is hard for me back down. I have the parent's authority at stake.

Luckily, I have a friendly relationship with boy so I allow myself to apologize to him

Note with meimei confrontation is not so high-stake.

--new: parenting: blogging=most therapeutic
therapeutic blogging takes lots of time, but is more effective than counselling on parenting, wordy problem face time,,,

--new: parent's pride in having"me"as child
Q: how does boy feel about parents' pride in having him as a son?
Q: how does he feel when other parents talk about their kids in positive terms. I seldom do.

Grandpa said repeatedly that he is proud of ah-boy.

--new: real danger]U.S.schools: bad influence !!academic level
Many immigrants think the majority of U.S. primary/middle schools (those rated below 8) are unacceptable compared to their home country's standard. I tend to feel the average school is good enough.

On the other hand, I feel the U.S. youth culture is dangerously loose. This culture poses more threat than the academic standard.
