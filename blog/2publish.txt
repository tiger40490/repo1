--new: What does a school district mean to me?
It means level of durg prevalance.
I don't care that that much about benchmark score

SG average school is possibl a 7/10 (possibly 10) school district in terms of benchmark and discipline. 
Why do I spend so much on U.S. top school districts (housing, private schools etc) when Singapore is cheaper and better?
