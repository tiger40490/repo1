best China index
You can collect the count of tracking ETFs for each index. The most popular index is MSCI China.

Gary singled out FTSE A50.

Gary believed China ADR stocks are correlated with China index much more than SP500.

-- new: Rbh process is highly efficient
Even safe bond funds on FSM involve much higher effort than my Robinhood process.

* problem: the amounts are too large, tyically 10k. Sugg: reduce to 1k
* risk/diligence: when I sell, I have to stay alert and ensure I don't sell the wrong lot i.e. from the wrong account
* the profit has to be recorded in my exp recon s/s
* I check the PnL for each position too often. 
* my tolerance is too low for large cash balance. sugg: accept 30k cash balance in cash account

-- new: ##low-cost pain relieves
see also lifestyle improvements since 2020

"low-cost" is subjective. No debate please.

eg: 2-printer lifestyle, with plenty of paper + spare cartridge
eg: powerline networking .. relieving pain of wifi dead zone
eg: small laptop with git-blogg .. without it I couldn't work on my active ideas
eg: dhost.. relieving pains of the free wordpress.com site

== new: tradeTime4$
H.Yi and AshS both mentioned something about trading time for money.
The proposed alternative is to make your money work harder to provide for family livelihood [3], so you don't need to. So you could spend your time on something else.

What's that something else? For me, it is some form of office work, rather than vacation.
Therefore, I willingly trade time for ... something to engage me.

[3] If we could _control_ exclub comparison, then livelihood burn rate can be taken care of already, so we don't need to work.

In the proposed alternative, you still need to spend time managing your portfolio!

-- babysitting still required. Very few nonwork incomes are truly passive and buy-n-forget, like CPF [SA and cpfLife]. 
REIT and div-stocks require babysitting when DYOC declines.

Rental properties (like mine in S.E.Asia) require some work with the local agents.

If the passive income stops being passive, then you are still trading time for money. That includes rental property management and day trading.

$2 wasted spend in Daiso .. is to be tolerated, given my nonwork incomes.
These spends won't accumulate beyond $1000/Y
ctbz in this case can be ineffective.

My due diligence (System 2) is sometimes too slow before spending such small amounts.  Let's record the small wasted spends so as to calibrate System 1.

-- slow cooking new 相形见绌 @interviews
jolt
When I meet an interviewer (or join a new tech team), I often notice a few individuals with superior technical capabilities. Most of these "superior" geeks are plump, less fit, with less healthy diets.

Many (but not a majority) of them, regardless of English skill, are also better communicators than me, but mostly am focused on tech competence -- where I often feel 相形见绌

Similar experience when I was trying out pre-sales and indepedent sales. I encountered many sales dragons. 

Similar experience when I meet an OC-effective peer like Shuo or Lunuo.Qiao. 

Somehow, subconsiouly and automatically I would brush aside the wellness differences, playing down my advantages. 

Well, at the deathbed or when well-off, what is more impotant? Personal Wellness or tech capabilities? I see no contest.

by a certian age like 45, we don't care so much about exclub or FOMO, and we can afford to ignore the smartphones (and other fancy, new stuff) that our cohort have.
I think this is a form of mellowing up, a form of let-go.

== update post on AMB course j4
need lots of sunshine (time and mental energy) and absorbency to overcome the initial learning curve. 
I think this is similar to CSY's attitude on coding drill.
It is also similar to my yoga practice. Now I share my yoga story with so many friends, as inspiration, even though I'm not highly successful.

-- j4 wpress course
The wpress course is heavy on page look-n-feel customization.
I hate this aspect and would not make good progress without this course.
I already spent real money on dhost. This is one way to leverage on that. I can set up multiple subdomains each for a landing page. My advantage over other newbies.
I already spent huge effort learning wpress. this is one way to leverage on that.
wpress has many books in library. Am good at learning from books.

bluehost is well-regarded. hostgator is comparable to dreamhost in terms of

* uptime .. usually "99%"

-- slow cooking update 4 def@success or new: quiet idle time
Let's give shortcodes to the 4 definitions
successE: ezlife...
successZ: zqbx
successL: legacy, lasting achievements
success1: the first and most common def@success

Q: At my age and my level of ffree, why do I still worry about coblood waste, and too much idle time?
A: Well, ezlife is not "complete" success as it captures one dimension of success. zqbx is another crucial dimension of success

Time wasted in pain, or other unintended wastes of time are always regrettable and should be minimized. 
Time wasted due to inefficiency is questionable.

Planned idle time can be free of pain.
I guess LKY in his twilight years decided to learn meditation.

To me, quiet idle time is a prolonged period of doing nothing, free of extraneous stimuations. Boredom can be good, as a BBC program reported.
I guess quiet idle time can be a deeper recharge but today I will assume this deeper recharge doesn't work for everyone.

I think quiet idle time is not bad for some retirees and some younger people. So far, I have limited appreciation for quiet idle time.  Jacob of ERE pointed out the "freedom TO" challenge. 90% of the time, I still have goals, and purposes and I still push myself towards them. 
One growing purpose is the need to live longer for my kids. (Longevity requires long-term effort, practice and time.) I feel I can add value to their lives. If I live longer, I can better control my surplus assets and decide how to use it to help my children and possibly their children.

Healthy longevity may benefit from quiet idle time, not strictly traditional meditation.

A quasi idle time is the broad category including musical instrument, calligraphy, painting/drawing, wife's handcrafting, knitting

-- slow-cooking update post on Jiang.Zhu
Consider JackZ and Raymond's situations. At my age and (my economic) level, what endeavors (spaceshuttle name) are really strategic?
1) wellness lifestyle improvements like yoga, sustainable diet habits, BMI
2) dev-till-70 accu, plowback,,, including QQ and CIV
? academic parenting? No. I prioritize motivation, bonding, coaching 
? prepare for relocation to U.S. including car ownership, burn rate control

Jiang.Zhu is an unknown LeadEngineer figure that I last met in 1991. Both him and the Fenix CTO are largely unknown personalities, so my mental picture of them are imagined and fabricated content fitted onto a half-skeleton.
I guess for both of them, there is still a lot of untapped potential, a lot of drive, ambition. Compared to them, I probably look lazy. 
Well, at my age whenever I look out towards the deathbed I feel those "things" are unimportant.

Similarly to my "laziness", my son may look lazy. In contrast at age 13 I was more motivated, more ambitious than him.
