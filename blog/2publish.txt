--new: profit lock-in #nice catchy phrase
when I notice a self-efficacy/aborbency/// "power surge", when I feel so powerful that I could overcome anything... I had better stop and ask myself "which tough jobs are becoming Spicy?". We had better aim to capture that power and lock in a "profit".

[15%] occasionally the wrong-time temptation becomes clearly more manageable as I feel more in control of my appetite.

[21%] Sometimes I get in the mood for localSys or company projects. Should consider camp-out.

Frequently, jogging becomes physicaly enjoyable (30%) or at least sustainable (60%). It's dangerous to expect this "peak" to last. Danger in terms of disappointment.

[25%] Sometimes coding drill gathers momentum and become sustainable on a weekly basis. Enjoyable is rarer like 5%.

[9%] Once a while my internal resistance to chin-up or yoga home-practice improves so much that I could do it on a Daily basis, but it seldom stays at that optimal level.

[19%] Sometimes my patience/capacity and ... for word problem coaching improves. This /space/ is a high-stake game, and remains highly unstable as I continue to lose grip and experience limited self-understanding. This is now the most challenging domain.

--new: ffree^FOMO: big-ticket spends 
useful to zoom into the biggest discretionary spends. 

If I benchmark with those earning 200k, my wife and kids would want vacations to Japan, Europe... When I tell them "not necessary", they might feel impoverished? Not sure.

Figures below are monthly outlays.
.. USD 5k/M mortgage + prop tax. USD 4k-6k
They would want a bigger home. I can accept a small home, but prime location!
Wife would want a top school district.
.. USD 2k/M/child private school 
.. USD 1k/M private car. Figure is total cost, depends on usage
They might want a brand new car, not pre-owned.
.. USD 1k/M/child enrichments. Figure varies a lot.

Majority of the people in my "home" cities waste numerous small amounts of money on a monthly basis. Over decades they "throw down the drain" a painful portion (like 10-20%) of their income.

Large number of small time-wastage is similar. Some of us feel the pain only years later when our peers make progress in their spare time or their office hours.

calorie-quota overconsumption is similar. We look back and feel the pain, sooner or later.

Among these ...., usable time is the most scarce, available up to age 60 or 55 for some.

Among these talents, the most significant (was $) is calorie-quota budgeting. It has long-term health benefits.

Among these endeavors, my success is most visible and decisive in $$, and least in time-saving

calorie-quota is a similar concept to carbon-quota. Each country each year is given a quota. If you over use then you need to borrow from the future quota.
