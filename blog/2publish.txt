--new cooked: open-house blogging choices
Open house distraction is worst when I need to focus, such as reflective blogging.

The best coping device is git-blogging .. It beats web blogging or even email blogging. 
Paper blogging won't let me build up a blogpost incrementally.

--fuxi or new: fresh foods are inferior
Fresh means expensive-yet-unsatisfying
fresh means perishable, can't store for weeks like other foods
fresh means higher risk of "wrong amount"
