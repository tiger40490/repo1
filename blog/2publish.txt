--new: prejudice: family time,fun time with boy..
jolt
What kinda individuals like to point a finger at a school "So many students have failed to score 600 marks on gaokao"?

Real long-term roti is rare like a perfect gaokao score:
* yoga? not lasting
* QQ? so fake
* coding test? Only for web 2.0 shops
* per investment? mostly small scale and recreational
* ...
So why the hell do I point my figer at family time, boy's coaching sessions, outing with boy, fun time with boy, relaxed time with boy?

Any relaxed moment is seen as too easy and not burning enough. Such a burn/rot view is poisonous, and double-standard -- I don't point my finger at
* myself blogging
* myself watching youtube
* myself on recreational reading 
* myself reading news, magazines
--new: clarity@thinking=non-trivial strength

clarity of thinking is a non-trivial strength in me. Many friends say I'm very reflective and demonstrate Grade-A self knowledge and self analysis. 

I feel many "peers" don't show clarity of thinking. My sis, dad show clarity.

Vocab is a top-4 factor but can help a lot, esp. when a common phrase is ambiguous and confusing. To my surprise, many clear thinkers seem to use a small vocab.

I explain my content very clearly to myself, not always so clearly to "them". In my view , clarity of thought is mostly a self-management skill, so I don't worry about "them".

Brevity is perhaps a top 5 clarity factor. I tend to be good in brevity of writing. Some verbal-type individuals show exceptional clarity. Genn?

My use of spreadsheet is a visual sign of clarity
