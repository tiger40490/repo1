-- update post on dense titles
To achieve the shortest titles, use Chinese wording, even though they are less valuable for sharing.

-- add to quadrants: 
..risk: real yoga may relocate .. unused credits. 
Better use up once a week or so 

..risk: fractional shares held at Rbh
Better "Buy" on those names that are close to a whole share.

-- update: pw recovery questions
the most tricky is 'your employer'. Just tell them "I change job every year. Please ask another question."

Another tricky question is "how many ATM cards". Just tell them "I use only 2 ATM cards".

The hotline will not remove the question even if they understand me.

I think this frustration is similar to having strange names (Kranti?), non-permanent addresses, multiple email addresses.

in the late 2000s, my mom said CNY 400k was a good-enough medical reserve for each retiree, on top of public health insurance (reimbursement-based). Such insurance has coinsurance, and numerous exclusions such as elective treatments [imported medication, supplements,,]. 

In 2022 my dad recalled that consensus figure among retirees of that time -- regardless of the medical condition, if CNY 500k is spent over and on top of insurance, and still the life can't be saved, then it's reasonable to give up. As such CNY 500k was a reasonable last-resort personal medical reserve, for millions of well-informed Chinese retirees.

Fast forward to 2022, CNY 500k-1000k of family savings is common according to my dad, living in Beijing. I think this improvement in savings reflects (medical++) inflation, rising income, rising wealth esp. in rEstate.

-- update blackholes:

Some American families received handout equivalent to 20% of annual income. This is rare -- very high percentage.

-- update traction/vision
Traction secret to better intimacy: cardio workout

AMB looks so daunting but someday I Will find a traction/vision secret

Re my mail to Edmund, most retail investors have not found a vision secrets like mine.

boy's math coaching... My new vision secret is .. put aside benchmarks and try to increase his intrinsic motivation by 1%. Possibly insignificant (I don't think so). Definitely better than nothing.

chin-up 100/D was daunting.. my traction secret is spread-out.

hair drooping over forehead .. I always had to visit a barber, but now I know this part grows faster than all other parts, so I could cut it short by myself.

-- new: hotlines in U.S.
cat: retire where

Rude awakening in early 2007: Government services were often very poor. Hit numerous immigration problems. ID issuance was slow. DMV had huge lines. Post office had shorter lines but inadequate hotlines.

Government Hotlines are overloaded...

Many government services are self-service, either online or by write-in [still common as of 2007]. Many complicated procedures with pages of instructions to read. Often you must ask friends + self-teach. Still you can hit roadblocks that require commercial, professional assistance.Â Sometimes there was a visible effort to simplify (or explain) the process for new users. I would say far from effective. In contrast, Singapore goverment services come with plenty of hotline staff (occasionally community centers too) .. adequate staffing !

Semi-government, non-profit services are similar. Hospitals, utilities, schools, credit bureaus, airports, transport authorities, police, legal systems, IRS,,,

Some big private [i.e. for-profit] service providers have adequate customer support, often tiered based on your account tier! I noticed it in GS, Verizon, ... So if you don't have enough in-house expertise, then you need to pay a premium.

In 2007, I couldn't afford to pay the premium :(

Alternatively, smaller service providers offer better customer support.
