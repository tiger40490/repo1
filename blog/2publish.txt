--new: Give yourself time: yoga
As Martin Thompson put it, time is the most important factor.

Some endeavors need time. Like a plant, they can't be rushed. 

I tend to rush on several endeavors:

give yourself time to experience yoga. Find your own practice. Could be totally different from other people's practice.

give yourself time to understand your own kids. Tough process. Non-trivial.

Give yourself time to experience diet and calorie restriction. Tough for everyone. Lifelong learning. Find your own way.

Give yourself time to understand the quant and machine-learning space and find your position and attitude

--new: yoga^coding-drill: derailer
(introspective)
In yoga and coding drill, the key derailer is peer comparison.

I felt doomed that whatever effort I put in, I would still be too weak too "short", too sub-standard compared to "their" standard.

Result: engine loss of power. Catastrophic failure.

--new jolt: brute force willpower never worked for me
My effective tactics against personal limitations have never been brute force willpower.
Brute force willpower never worked for me even though some level of self-discipline is required.

I have always needed something smarter, more personalized, less direct, more subtle, 

.. chin-up
.. yoga
.. coding drill
.. boy's motivation

--new: yoga=no-win endeavor
jolt:
whenever my weekly yoga was suspended, I always beat myself up ...
When I resume yoga, I still feel too easy (wasting time) and too tough (unsustainable), and insufficient effort i.e. lazy self.

Therefore, yoga felt like a whip and a no-win endeavor.

--new: Availability=SG temptation
1. In Bayonne, there's no budget street food as in Toa Payoh. 
2. There's no cooked food at home. Availability temptation is much easier to handle.

--new: ##freedom from common ailment
Every now and then, I remind myself how lucky I am to be without the common physical pains. I won't include the vague, too-wide-ranging emotional pains.

no sexual difficulties
no weakening eyesight
no skin problem
no neck pain
no bad posture leading to various pains
no joint problems
no plantar fasciitis

--new: long-term roti is rare;prejudice on fun time with boy
jolt
What kinda individuals like to point a finger at a school and say "So many students have failed to score 600 marks on gaokao"?

Real long-term roti is rare like a perfect score:
* yoga? not lasting
* QQ? so fake
* coding test? Only for web 2.0 shops
* per investment? mostly small scale and recreational
* ...
So why the hell do I point my figer at family time, boy's coaching sessions, outing with boy, fun time with boy, relaxed time with boy?

Any relaxed moment is seen as too easy and not burning enough. Such a burn/rot view is poisonous, and double-standard -- I don't point my finger at
* myself blogging
* myself watching youtube
* myself on recreational reading 
* myself reading news, magazines

I have been utterly prejudiced in my assessment of family-time utilization. 
* yoga -- considered not burn and low ROTI... Actually extremely hard. Arguably more strategic than the coding drill etc, 
* work out with kids -- considered not burn and low ROTI (too much wasted time) .. Actually tough, and builds family bound. Arguably no less strategic than QQ
* strength training -- considered not burn, not hard enough.
* prepare math worksheet -- considered not burn, not hard enough, not strategic, not related to my career
* review zbs -- considered not burn not IV-relevant.
* review GTD -- considered not burn not IV-relevant.
* review QQ -- considered not burn and not strategic
* bring boy out shopping as reward for him -- considered high tcost low ROTI but extremely important to his +/-ve feedback loop 

Overall, I was fixated on materialistic ROTI and self-discipline over the lazy self
--new: clarity@thinking=non-trivial strength

clarity of thinking is a non-trivial strength in me. Many friends say I'm very reflective and demonstrate Grade-A self knowledge and self analysis. 

I feel many "peers" don't show clarity of thinking. My sis, dad show clarity.

Vocab is a top-4 factor but can help a lot, esp. when a common phrase is ambiguous and confusing. To my surprise, many clear thinkers seem to use a small vocab.

I explain my content very clearly to myself, not always so clearly to "them". In my view , clarity of thought is mostly a self-management skill, so I don't worry about "them".

Brevity is perhaps a top 5 clarity factor. I tend to be good in brevity of writing. Some verbal-type individuals show exceptional clarity. Genn?

My use of spreadsheet is a visual sign of clarity
