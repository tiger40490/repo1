--new gr8idea: take-up-for-fun: wordy problems
My assumption -- he has lost the basic skills. Pushing him hard will be ineffective.

温和地坚持

On the other hand, he probably needs more perseverance. He has a tendency to give up and puts in fake effort

Note Take-up-for-fun involves (confrontational?) facetime and can create pain (frustration/regret/losing-cool) in me, despite the 'for-fun' slogan.

Biggest problem -- insufficient motivation

--update on plowback
zbs and GTD except tool knowledge, are overrated in terms of plowback. In contrast, IV body-building is a worthwhile plowback.
dnlg? Not so effective as plowback.
fitness? Excellent Plowback 
stock investment? Too time-consuming, not worthwhile.
parenting? Yes takes huge amount of time but 90% inefficient in terms of plowback
English (and Chinese) vocab?

--new: exercise for weight loss #WaPo
https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/exercise-does-so-much-for-you-why-wont-it-make-you-lose-weight/2017/08/11/618db370-77d7-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304_story.html claims

“high levels of physical activity seem to be very important for maintenance of lost weight, HIGH as more than an hour of exercise daily."

"Exercise helps keep lost pounds off, but exercise alone can’t do the initial job of losing it."

"To exercise your way out of overeating is impossible."

"To be sure, some people can work weight off, experts say. These include those who exercise vigorously for long periods, and professional athletes, who typically engage in high-intensity workouts. But they are the exceptions. Those high-level workouts are 'not something most people' "

--new: weight-loss supplements: questionable
https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/metabolism/art-20046508 claims

"As you get older, the amount of muscle tends to decrease and fat accounts for more of your weight, slowing down calorie burning."

"Aerobic exercise is the most efficient way to burn calories and includes activities such as walking, bicycling and swimming. As a general goal, include at least 30 minutes of physical activity in your daily routine."

Strength training exercises at least twice a week. Strength training is important because it helps counteract muscle loss associated with aging. And since muscle tissue burns more calories than fat tissue does, even at rest, muscle mass is a key factor in weight loss.

"Don't look to dietary supplements for help in burning calories or weight loss." Manufacturer may cite clinical trials and claim "98%" effective, but the statistics are often weak and flawed. They may use the most obese individuals whose weight fluctuate a lot.
