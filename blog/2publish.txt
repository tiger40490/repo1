-- new: don't offend criminals
Most criminals won't rob a random stranger.

Criminals would hurt or kill for even a small amount if they feel justified.

If you owe them money
If you steal even a single dollar from them
If you cheat them or short-change them
If you show them disrespect, they would feel justified to hurt or even kill

-- update bpost on family counsell 
Advantage of CGC counselling -- counsellor has access to boy's data and has seen him about 3 times.
insurance coverage

consider for-profit counsellor for parenting, diet and other things.

Diet counselling need to be an element due to insurance.
Parenting counselling is a key element as my wife may also need to join me.

I think wife's need is more critical. In contrast, I have a support network already.

-- new: minimize diagnosis psychiatry
Diagnosis has a commercial dimension. It helps with insurance claim.
In some countries, some practitioners are "ready" with a diagnosis.

My focus in this bpost is Singapore.
Some private clinics are more willing to give diagnosis. 
IMH has a policy to minimize diagnosis.

I told Cigna that 1)I need a diagnosis for reimbursment 2) I hate the labeling of the diagnosis.

If you do get a label, you need to be careful about the label

Now that IMH has no formal ODD diagnosis, I feel free to use the ODD term loosely.
