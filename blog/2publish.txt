-- new: which country to call home
I can imagine a (legal or illegal) immigrant to the U.S. (or SGP) without GreenCard. She has lived most if not 98% of her life in the U.S. (perhaps born there) and is more familiar with U.S. than her original country, but she has a relatively priviledged life in her original country (wealth, family network/relationships, status,,,)

Q: which country does she call home?
%%A: her original country, not the country where she spends most of her life ! In the U.S. she remains a second-class citizen (immigration status, skin color, wealth, Language,,,). She belongs to some sub-group, but not upper-middle class.

Aha: it's your social strata within each country, that determine which country you prefer. You can call it exclub, FOLB or peer comparison.

Since Sep/Oct I feel my carefree ezlife is diminishing/declining/// in some strange way. It takes effort to explain it

The DIYHI created lots of conflicts, self-blame, zsms about tcost, involution.

Then in Nov, kids' math exam results ..

Then in Mar 2023, EDyw was a real blow according to the rmSelf, but for the xpSelf, Edyw didn't /knock me out/ of my carefree zone.

In the grand scheme of things, these pains/unhappy episodes would pass.
The "carefree" felt so short-lived to the rmSelf, but (to the xpSelf) it soon returned.
