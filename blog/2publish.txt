-- new: brank~=luxury car
What's in common between a luxury car and a brank like "Director"?

enviable, glamorous, glorifying

high maintenance, high visibility

you need some minimum personal capacity ("performance") to maintain it

can wear out quickly, esp. when you age.

Not a passive income generator, 

perhaps not a cashcow asset, 

--new: fix annoyances before stress spike
These annoyances can grow into stressors when my "healthcare overwhelmed". Therefore, it's best to chip away at them when not under stress
* bofa credit balance cheques
* retrofitness extra charges
* tax filing
* hardware breakdowns
* repair/replace - home fixtures, electronics, 

What kinda buffer would be effective against these random stressors? 
* short commute
* evening/weekend flexible work hours
* consistent time allocated to coding drill
* consistent time allocated to jogging, yoga and strength training
* adequate rest including sleep
* plenty of paid time-off
* movies?

--new: profit lock-in #nice catchy phrase
when I notice a self-efficacy/aborbency/// "power surge", when I feel so powerful that I could overcome anything... I had better stop and ask myself "which tough jobs are becoming Spicy?". We had better aim to capture that power and lock in a "profit".

[15%] occasionally the wrong-time temptation becomes clearly more manageable as I feel more in control of my appetite.

[21%] Sometimes I get in the mood for localSys or company projects. Should consider camp-out.

Frequently, jogging becomes physicaly enjoyable (30%) or at least sustainable (60%). It's dangerous to expect this "peak" to last. Danger in terms of disappointment.

[25%] Sometimes coding drill gathers momentum and become sustainable on a weekly basis. Enjoyable is rarer like 5%.

[9%] Once a while my internal resistance to chin-up or yoga home-practice improves so much that I could do it on a Daily basis, but it seldom stays at that optimal level.

[19%] Sometimes my patience/capacity and ... for word problem coaching improves. This /space/ is a high-stake game, and remains highly unstable as I continue to lose grip and experience limited self-understanding. This is now the most challenging domain.

--new: ffree^FOMO: big-ticket spends 
useful to zoom into the biggest discretionary spends. 

If I benchmark with those earning 200k, my wife and kids would want vacations to Japan, Europe... When I tell them "not necessary", they might feel impoverished? Not sure.

Figures below are monthly outlays.
.. USD 5k/M mortgage + prop tax. USD 4k-6k
They would want a bigger home. I can accept a small home, but prime location!
Wife would want a top school district.
.. USD 2k/M/child private school 
.. USD 1k/M private car. Figure is total cost, depends on usage
They might want a brand new car, not pre-owned.
.. USD 1k/M/child enrichments. Figure varies a lot.
