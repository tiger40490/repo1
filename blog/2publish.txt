--new: filling foods may not add weight
Starchy root plants like potato, yam, lentil .. do feel very filling. 
I FEEL (and believe) they are fattening to many people including me, but in reality, perhaps their dietary fiber pass through my system without adding to my weight? My personal experience seems to suggest they do increase my weight.

Various nuts feel very filling. 
I FEEL they are fattening, but in reality, the overall quantity I eat tends to add to way, way, way below half the amount of starchy foods. 

In theory, these filling foods could reduce the hunger/craving, but in me, the hunger would come back within 3 hours. 
I have concluded from decades of self-observation that the hunger depends 
* mostly on the fullness of stomach for the 3 hours after a meal.
* Afterwards, hunger depends 99% on availability

So far, most satisfying foods do add weight to MY system, except a few precious items
* protein smoothie
* melons, grapes, 

Chia seeds are filling but not satisfying. I FEEL they aren't fattening at all.

perhaps ice cream is not as fattening as feared. I think ice cream with chia could provide fiber, water, ..  

--update blog on daily battle or temptation
When I face the temptation (wrong time, wrong portion, wrong food), how recently how much I just ate doesn't matter. 
Instead, Availability is the main factor. (temptation is the negative version of it). 
Mental Stress is another key, but much lower frequency.

Promethean struggle? No we aren't doomed to lose all effort.
Coding drill is not only short term.
Workout is not only short-term.
Flexibility exercise (Yoga) is not only short-term.
Smoke cessation is not only short-term.
Calorie restriction is not only short-term. 
Availability is not only short-term. 
If you control availability for 9 months, you would see results (in terms of ...).
If you lose control over temptation for 3 months, you will see results. 

By "losing control", I don't  mean eating lots of bad food for 3 months. I mean the unregulated availability of acceptable, often healthy, food, such as yogurt, lean meat, ...

Too much "healthy" food is a major health hazard.

Wrong time seems to be the biggest of the three temptations.

--new: say-no-to one cake at a time
many dieters feel hopeless about cutting down one cake because the next meal would see a wipe-out of this "improvement". 
If you believe the temptation is always bigger than your resolve, then you would feel hopeless fighting it.

In reality, every successful dieter started by cutting down one cake. 

We slowly change our diet habits and combat the temptation. The temptation is not always bigger than us. We are not doomed.

--new? time^absorbency..2 scarce resources
see also blogpost on absorbency domains

time is a /limiting factor/ (with a twin sister) because when I try to break through and reach the next level on some endeavor, I often hit a /ceiling/ not in terms of my capacity but in terms of time. 

Common experience shared by many, therefore easy to understand. In contrast, a more subtle experience is the limiting factor of productive mood. 
This phrase is vague and intangible, so sometimes I speak of "motivation" -- not exactly same and still vague. 
Sometimes I speak of "absorbency" as a more specific proxy. 

Specific xp: I often take leave specifically to provide time for myself but usually can't achieve the expected ROTI.

Specific xp: Many times I took leaves to attend an IV. The time + absorbency is a precious combination that leads to breakthrough. If I only provide time to myself, most of the time I don't achieve much in terms tech learning.

Specific xp: yoga -- the absorbency is very rare, far worse than jogging. 

* the zone -- (as described in my email) i often need a block of uninterrupted hours. Time is clearly a necessary but insufficient condition.
* time for workout -- I often tell my friends that lack of time sounds like an excuse given the mini-workout option. Well, free time still helps a lot, but motivation is more important in this case.
* localSys -- absorbency is more rare here than coding drill, which is more rare than c++QQ which is more rare than java QQ
* face time with boy -- math practice etc.. the calm, engaged mood on both sides is very rare and precious. I tend to lose my cool even when I make time for my son.
* laptop working at train stations -- like MRT stations or 33rd St ... to capture the mood. Available time by itself is useless

--new: complacent guys]RTS #Deepak
Deepak told me that Rahul, Padma etc stayed in RTS for many years and became "complacent" and uninterested in tech topics outside their work.

I think Deepak has sharp observation.

I notice many Indian colleagues uninterested in zbs or QQ topics. That's a fundamental reason for my QQ strength on the WallSt body-building arena.
I think many of them learn the minimum to pass tech interviews.
CSY has this attitude on coding IV but the zbs attitude on socket knowledge 

If you regularly benchmark yourself externally, often against younger guys, you are probably more aware of your standing, your aging, the pace of tech churn, ... You live your days under more stress, both negative and positive stress. 

I think these RTS guys may benchmark internally once a while, if ever. If the internal peers are not very strong, then you would get a false sense of strength.

The RTS team may not have any zbs benchmark, since GTD is (99.9%) the focus for the year-end appraisal.

These are some of the reasons Deepak felt 4Y is the max .. Deepak felt H1 guys are always on our toes and therefore more fit for survival.

--new: Ashish/MLP IV: QQ^GTD
I feel Ashish's MLP IV experience again proves the relative importance of GTD vs QQ

His GTD capacity is evident, but high-end interviews always discount/dismiss GTD and focus on QQ instead, including "problem-solving" as the young bbg interviewer put it.

Tanvil's self-description is revealing, but Ashish is a better example as I know him better than I know other peers.

Viswa is another example. 

GTD superstars are typically not recognized experts. They fail the expertise-benchmark.
