--update blogpost on java=outlier
These are tech fads in my experience, but can someone live on this tech till retirement, like the technical writers?
C#, WPF
perl
stored proc
mysql
php
apache, DNS
LotusNotes apps for Raymond

Was I lucky? I was lucky only with coreJava !
I had my share of unluckiness.

I feel by 2030 java bigData will go out of fashion just like java Generics, Hibernate, functional java, streams API, .

-- new: respect not tied2benchmarking
Nothing much new, but a useful revision.

I told a Cigna counsellor, what's really important to my job satisfaction is respect, but the elephant in the room ... is benchmarking.

GS is the most direct experience. Respect from manager, peers, users and even self-respect is mostly based on benchmarking within your own team, and within the bigger department.
My ErrorMemos user in Texas gave me exceed, perhaps based on his past experience with other developers. Yet my manager found me nothing spectacular.

Users and External peers and users may not know what the other team members are able to achieve *if put in my shoes* so no benchmark per se. Yet these evaluators have an expectation and based on it, a level of respect to you

.. Among performing artists (and visual, literal artists), some artists are loved by their audience, but Question: what about the ranking? 
My answer: the ranking doesn't matter to their audience. If I'm an audience of a particular writer, composer, singer ... then I see unique value in her, regardless of the ranking chart.

.. students in general
My kids don't need to be outstanding to learn useful things and have a meaningful experience in school
Excellence is measured on personal growth. This is within the student's circle of control.

.. researchers like my dad

.. my piano practice and yoga .. is a different form of "respect". I exceed my limitations and my inertia and I derive various benefits, all without benchmarking.

-- new: technology churn on WallSt^internet
my perception of churn has been fundamentally shaped by two phases in my professional experiences -- pre-2007 internet career in SG and post-2007 WallSt career in US/SG.

The technologies in the internet space has faster churn. 

A big chunk of WallSt infrastructure is browser-based, intranet or internet. They experience similiar level of churn. Jxee is affected. Remember PWM servlet-based framework?

Another chunk of WallSt infrastructure is low churn, including coreJava, c++, SQL, MOM, FIX, sockets, batch jobs

By the way, Linux is dominant on WallSt and in the broader internet ecosystem.

UI technology is usually high-churn. Increasingly browser-based.

-- new: wind-down tcost: to be embraced
Opening eg: In Bayonne, after every yoga+pull-up workout, I would spend about 2 hours shopping to wind down. It's a kind of reward, so that the prospect of the next session is not so off-putting. 

The wind-down is a necessary tcost, due to human nature. I don't think there's any superhuman, not in my dad, in Wenqiang, in Rahul. 

In a way, this wind-down is comparable to sleep. Sleep is not a waste of precious time. Sleep is a positive element our human life. 

The wind-down is a replenishment/recharge/recuperation and should be seen in a positive light.

If the wind-down is enjoyable, then be grateful.

.. speed coding exercise .. is very taxing, depleting my reserve. 
.. QQ learning is more enjoyable than speed coding exercise and require less wind-down.
.. my son's green zone.. 

--update the blogpost on HF
t_fomo^livelihood
To HF, do I come across as fully satisfied, without pains, except parenting?

1) PIP, bonus, stigma, respect
2) FOLB, exclub peer comparison
3) boy's "performance"

In terms of livelihood, All my top 3 deep, recurring pains above are "superficial" i.e. not real threats to my family livelihood, largely thanks to my interview skills. But IV is the flagship of a fleet of strengths. I should also give credit to
* the dev (not just tech) job market and my decision to stick to it. I have key talents to thrive in it such as low cultural bias
* the WallSt contract market that I discovered and held on to
* lifelong wellness habits
* bedrock of stable marraige. I made the right choice.
* bedrock of SG citizenship providing essential protections. I made the right choice.
* my lifelong earn/save/invest and Fuller wealth strengths

My descriptions above tends to lean towards external locus of control, but in reality my personal factors are more important.

--new: robux spend
I spent money on robux to reduce his gaming time, but is it working?
Need a critical, open discussion with boy.

If not "reducing" then I feel this is like timezone -- spending money to give him the reward that he really appreciates.
