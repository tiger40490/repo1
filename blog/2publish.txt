--new: ##delightful technologies with biggest impact@my personal life
This is low-value blogpost. Before inventing git-blogging, I would post it to blog, or keep this item in gmail draft and spend too much time on it.

recoll -- notepad + MSWE (not MSWord )
spreadsheet for assets.xlsx and other personal investment. 
blogger .. wordpress 
gmail draft .. git blogging
low-cost home printer + copier
strawberry perl + git-bash as my c++ IDE for coding drill

--new? finer things in life
(This kind of blogpost is best done in git-blogging :)
The consumerism has hijacked this phrase, but to me, most finer things in life are free or easily available to the lower-income families, such as
* fruits, raw or cooked vegetables
* parks
* trips to natural scenes
* swimming pool. 
* Jogging in the park is free, but I prefer a proper stadium.
* harmony at home and in office
* a good read, a good movie, good music
