-- email: some notes about our pre-Christmas meet-up
Hi Xinghe,

After talking to you, I feel lucky about my current job, my level of wellness, my family,,, despite various challenges.

Between us, a shared "goal" is to work till old age, right?. I call it career longevity. Do you have a specific target age? (My target is to work as a developer till 70.)
I feel lucky about my access to the U.S. job market which will become relevant when I lose my current job and if I can't find an acceptable replacement in Singapore. This "access" is precious and unavailable to 90% of my cohort. 

You taught at ITE for 5 years? I feel teaching math/computing can be a viable second career even though I may not be talented. Teaching profession is age-friendly, enjoys stable demand, and provides social interaction (with young people) when I'm old and lonely. What do you think?

I can also consider teaching older people. Perhaps yoga or aerobic exercise. Some older students feel more comfortable with teachers of their age. 

I enjoy English writing. I write English diary every day. I can also consider teaching English vocab/writing to Chinese students, though I don't have a qualification. I could consider completing a part time diploma, provided it helps me establish myself as an English teacher.

These teaching jobs are possibly better than cleaner or other unskilled laborer jobs. Nevertheless, I am open to all of them.

I feel you have successZ (zi qiang bu xi) and a lot of successE (easy life).. Do you agree?

I described to you the scenario -- I follow my father's foot steps and go through the same health declines in my late 80s. I predicted that I would want to live 10 more years in "poor health". There is limited evidence but my prediction is based on some observations:
* I can see my father's vital signs are basically normal for his age -- heart, lungs, liver, kidney, cognitive functions. No physical pains as far as I know. Early stage prostate cancer was recently diagnosed and brought under control.
* He suffered poor digestion + insomnia for decades .. not deteriorating badly, but a source of distress 
* He does fall sick easily but nothing life-threatening 

Admittedly, quality of life is uneviable (miserable? I don't think so). Both my sister and I feel my dad's "pains" are largely pscyhological. His condition was diagnosed as depression. 

In his shoes, I would hopefully fare better. (By that, I don't mean I'm smarter.) I'm hopeful, and optimistic. I don't perceive those "twilight years" as years of suffering.

It's not obvious which stressors are beneath the current state of anxiety/pessimism. It takes skills, effort, practice and sys2 resources to /identify/ those stressors. 

Sometimes my sys2 resources feel like depleted, and I choose to focus on chipping away at one of the big-rock stressors/tasks:

* math facetime, family game night, or outing with boy.. to make me feel less guilty as a father
* company projects
* DIYHI
* localSys refresh .. "direct" effort on an quadrant-II item

In the context of the R.Teo bpost (https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/46375/23copsolutions-r-teo/), these efforts are "direct" efforts. 
Other times, none of the direct efforts are appealing or effective, so I would try some diversion efforts or "biological" efforts.

-- new: psyInf[psychological inflexibility]
There's a technical literature on psychological inflexibility, and my concept is an unscientific, and unconstrained adaptation. I like it loose and vague -- Additional precision (blogg) would create Sys2 workload. IFF blogging is purely recreational (for-fun), then it may serve as a brain exercise. It does strenghthen my vocabulary.

Eg: ctbz is a good habit overall, but can become psyInf
Eg: bur or rot
Eg: calorie restriction .. daily battles
Eg: Just don't eat anything unless hungry .. I guess psyInf is leaning too much to one extreme. The other extreme is also very common -- grossly inadequate regulation and enforcement so that BMI never really improves.
Eg: I have poor tolerance for wasteful small spends. Many of them feel like (the worse type of) life style creep.
Eg: I struggle to accept my son's impunctuality for school, tuition classes, medical appointments etc.
Eg: I remember XiaoChen came to my house to help repair something and he forgot one tool, so he drove to a nearby shop to buy it. (If I were him) I can't accept such imperfect planning. Self-hate.
Eg: I have numerous elaborate guidelines for air travel. I spend many hours a day over many days in meticulous preparation for a single flight. If I fail to observe one of my guidelines I feel insecure, anxious.

-- new: 8K/Y top-up to wife's cpfSA
top up 8k/Y to wife's SA to enjoy tax relief.

No tax relief if she earns 4k/Y (i.e. as soon as she starts working) !

No tax relief if you top up 3-way

Use PayNow QR, latest in the last week of Dec. Avoid weekends. Nov is also fine.

-- update bpost on inflation xp in sg
An easy mistake is to count the recent lunch bills . With a handful of recent experiences of the last year, you get a very "confident" and concrete estimate of the "typical" cost as of this year. 

However, you would very easily forget to hold-constant or control some important factors such as the venue and number of dishes. 

Need to use the same coffee shop food, or the same food court food, or the same Chinatown food. 

-- update bpost on restore
Something to look forward to
* Japan trip, even if boy's results are not great
* decent timing at the next 5.6k
* BMI improvement
* getting BGC title 
* more reunions with grandparents
* more math games with meimei; more cycling trips with boy

-- update bpost on effective endeavor
Another effective intervention #unexpected

Throughout my career and family-building in Sg and US, my personal strategy [decisions, plann/executions, adjustments] about car ownership is .. surprisingly effective. 

Most of my peers "need" a car. They give various explanations of personal needs. It sounds like "so hard to cope without a car in this (part of) country", but I think what they mean is "Since I can afford [1] (to lease) a car, it is proving extremely convenient."

Many point to their own work/home locations, but hey, look at my choice of locations. I chose them to minimize car dependency.

[1] Affordability is personal. I can afford so I do fly up to 4/year for family reunion. Not essential, but a personal priority.

I did spend about USD 1k twice learning to drive. In 2018/19 I also practiced with zipcar. That's part of my effective endeavor.

-- update bpost on longevity https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=48298&action=edit
In Dec 2023 I started to worry about quality_of_life in my mom's twilight years, either in a Beijing nursing home, or a Singapore nursing home, or living with my wife (while I'm away in the U.S.), against the backdrop of her declining health.

quality_of_life is another side of VV (one of the trio).

All the scenarios appear pathetic, unappealing, scary,,, As people grow old, they are bound to experience (some or all of) mobility decline, mental decline, living away from immediate family, or outside their own comfortable home. Inevitable for many in their 80s and beyond. 

Given an elderly's health, financial and family situation, his choices are often limited. If money is not the problem (willing suspension of disbelief), then perhaps he can live with family + adequate healthcare at home [R.Teo's dad?]. Hopefully (big hope), the in-law caregivers are able to cope, supported by plenty of external resources. This "acceptable" bar is too high to be realistic.

Before I can plan ahead, I have to give up on unrealistic expectations.

How about my ADL insurance? I now feel somewhat more vindicated. 

The more children and grandchildren I have, the more resources I have available in my old age.

-- new: livelihood shield won't fend off these"pains"
When we Struggle against or Cope with multiple /issues/, we often envy the affluent. We imagine their lives are less stressful, less frustrating, less burdened. Actually, "carefree bubble" depends on many factors such as number of dependents, amount of belongings (baggage), support network (citizenship?). However, this bpost is focused on the factor of livelihood (affluence). 

Even without livelihood issues/worries, some people (including my family-n-fiend) can feel real pains due to 
* physical pains
* psychological pains .. phobia, anxiety, depression...
* serious lack of self-discipline, or substance abuse, or addiction, in the self or a family member. Remember Biden's son.
* wasted personal potential? If livelihood fine, then the "waste" is tolerable?
* failure in love relationships (incl. non-starter)... "Affluence" doesn't meet this need.
* chronic family conflicts .. eg: me vs in-laws; between grandparents; sis vs grandpa
* injustice .. eg: See https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=24197&action=edit
* gross unfair treatment ... eg? losing a /rewarding/ job for a bitter reason like personality, or unfair dismissal

Bias of hindsight/rmSelf.. I would say a lot of times such an "event" does cause livelihood issues "for a while". Could be a few days to a few years. I guess many (rmSelf) dismiss the livelihood "stress" in hind sight, but in the midst of it the stress our xpSelf does feel non-trivial and permanent (just as covid19 felt like in 2020).

How about during the retirement phase? 
* work headaches reduced, but we may miss the engagement, the purpose, the F2F interaction. I would rather stay employed in a light-duty job, and endure some non-trivial stress
* Parenting pains reduced
* family conflict may reduce due to smaller family
* no more personal potential to waste
* I may be more dependent on others

==== update serenity bpost
-- trying too hard .. If you aim too high, and try too hard, you will get bruised all over.
I once tried moving up brank, OC-effective. Bruised all over.
quant career .. I made a real attempt for quant career. Too hard. Not worth the effort.
stretch .. In lower middle school I attempted very tough daily stretches. Too painful and unrewarding to continue.
perseverent_foreplay and higher intimacy frequency .. too much difficulty and conflict. I now aim lower... more at peace.
monthly div income .. in early 2010s I was aiming at 1k -> 2k average monthly, using mufu. Such a goal was too high even with U.S. stocks, so I gave up.
grandpa bathing .. grandma was aiming too high, trying too hard to persuade him.
English for wife.. I tried "improving" wife's English grammar and writing. Too difficult. See email in Oct 2023
wordy problems for boy and meimei .. 
EAE for boy .. I am trying too hard since the Jun seminar at NYP.

-- add to bpost on 3-in-1 printer
~~new Printer driver install
After driver installation, sooner or later, we need an initial connection between the hardware. A common juncture of failure.

If cable is loose or printer is off, then you can check using device-manager -- unplugging/turning-off will remove an item immediately from device-manager; plugging/turning-on will add an item immediately to device-manager. Windows may also beep :) These are good signs. If you don't see any of these signs, then driver is broken or windows is broken.

Note Device manager is more low-level than Printers-n-scanners-page. It is able to show the new device earlier than PnSP can. Windows restart may be required before PnSP shows the new device.

Insufficient diskspace can mess up the installation in some strange way.

I prefer test-printing a single dot (notepad file).
