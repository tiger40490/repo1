--update blogpost on 12M delay
eg: my sis was delayed by a year+ when transferring from RongCheng to Dongzongbu. Is there any negative/hazardous effect? No but at that time I saw it as a stigma

So in my family, both my sister and I went through a big delay and we both turned out fine.

The stigma on delayed students was a modern China phenomenen. There is some kind of perception (superstition) that if a kid is hitting some academic standard, then the younger she is the stronger is her age-adjusted score and academic potential.
