-- update blog on 1st day back in office:
The recurring loss of family harmony is the most common reason I need the harbor of office. The library/stadium/MRT are also helpful.

--update blog on free books
As my collection of free books grows, I may realized there are too many books at home. It proved to be a recurring problem when moving home. Over the years, I have developed my preference for /travel-light/.

Jolt: Those individuals with a large book collection didn't move home as often ! They probably own many books that they seldom read. They were lucky to avoid facing the same reality I faced.

Sugg: proactively give away irrelevant books. This is slightly harder with books I bought.

Another reality with book ownership is -- our reading interests evolve with age.
Sugg: give away some titles that no longer appeal to me, perhaps after browsing through the TOC.
