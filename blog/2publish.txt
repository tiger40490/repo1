--new: Bonus=one person’s appraisal@mentality
Bonus is only one person's appraisal of my value-add, attitude, ...
Therefore, my own self-assessment and self-esteem can reference that but only as a small factor. It’s very dangerous to tie my self-esteem to this single factor. People can and do care too much about this one factor.

In many places (Macq, GS,,, ) I actually cared to do a good job for the boss and for the firm, but still failed to impress the boss. In such a context, I must contain the damage of that appraisal, or risk ruining my self-esteem and motivation at work.
