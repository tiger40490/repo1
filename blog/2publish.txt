CSY described the reaction of his 3 India-born contractors when manager anounced in a meeting the termination of their project. Project funding would end very soon.
Mgr promised to try and find other teams, but it's unlikely to have all 3 contractors retained.
CSY felt so much luckier because as perm he would have a job in other projects in the same team.

Therefore, he felt he would consider contract only if salary is 50% higher. Underlying reason -- his age and job search challenges are real. Dev-till-70 is not so easy.

This type of observation/experience reinforces the job insecurity "smell" of the contract career.

--update blogpost on wechat vs mail
email is Much better than wechat voice mail for me... can archive, search, can respond a few days later at my own pace. 

I'm not sure but I guess some people might be using wechat voice mail too much for their own good. Voice mail can add stress to one's life because it is harder to manage compared to paper mail, email, online chats, mobile text message or in-person chat. (Note I do use voice mail myself, and I think they are valuable in some contexts.)

With a voice mail, if you don't respond, it just piles up in a tiny screen with 20 other voice mails (among 100 text messages), without any textual clue about their contents. It's unmanageable IMO. Therefore, the recipient is forced to respond right away. Unnecessary urgency, unnecessary stress. 

Maybe young people use wechat voice mail in a different way. (I won't speculate how or why.) I always prefer to receive messages with subjects and have the option to warehouse it until free to deal with it. Voice mail is unmanageable in my system.

Q: Can protein powder replace a meal?
With plenty of ice (chia seed is secondary) it did fill my stomach AND provide energy. However, the wrong-time temptation is overpowering for this poor substitute of a traditional meal
I think key is starch. Protein powder has no starch. chia, ice, protein powder can provide a full meal, but if you have had no starch for a while, then the temptations simply wipe out everything and you can feel hungry (hedonic) again. This is the nature of our senses. 

Try adding some cooked green beans, corn or rice into the smoothie
