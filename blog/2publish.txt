问题之一： 两年前， 再三讨论之后我们决定不躲避新加坡国民服役， 为的是 以后确保大宝有资格回新加坡发展， 不至于被盖上逃兵役的帽子， 永远列入新加坡政府的黑名单。 如今他过了 11 岁生日还没”逃离“新加坡， 兵役这个义务，恐怕躲也躲不掉了。 

自从做此决定，我一直耿耿于怀 -- 大宝在美国 18 岁高中毕业（2026 夏），先得回新加坡当兵两年 （2027初 - 2029初），要（2029年秋）21岁才能上大学。 （或者 2029 年初入大学） 比同龄人晚两三年。

问题之二： 大宝这孩子比我缺乏自律， 但合群， 更容易受朋友影响 （有点像姑姑）。 在美国如果大多数朋友都不断怂恿他尝试毒品， 说没啥了不起， 不妨一试， 他可能会抵御不了而随波逐流。 到那一天我将无地自容。 因为2019 年我预见这个灾难， 却仍旧送我的亲儿子”进火坑“， 是父亲的罪过，没法原谅自己。

问题之三： 美国校风较好的学校都比较贵， 要么是学区房子贵(而且普遍上下班路程远)， 要么是私立学校， 一年学费两三万。 无一例外。 为了大宝不学坏， 爸爸可能要接受这个现实。

新思路： 大宝在新加坡读完中四， 考完 O 水准，无论成绩如何， 先服兵役 （2025 年初）。 18岁退役（2027初）再赴美。 选个好学区， 以成绩考进 12 年纪 (高中最后一年） 或 11 年纪。 毕业后马上进大学， 最迟(2028 秋天) 20 岁。
新加坡教育水平高出美国一两年， 所以有希望能考进 12 年纪， 之后 19岁就可能念大学，减轻了第一个问题。

更重要的是解决了问题之二 -- 18岁的大宝比同学大一两岁， 更成熟， 判断力增强了。 爸爸妈妈更放心他， 当然还是要反复提醒教导兄妹俩，远离毒品。

从校风和教学质量来评估， 新加坡的普通中学（名校更不用说了）， 应该算是美国的优等甲级中学。 最重要是校风，比中国都严。 所以大宝在新加坡读完中四， 等于读了四年美国的优等甲级中学， 而不用付甲级的学费， 所以我们捡了个便宜 （偷着乐）。

假如只在美国读最后一两年高中 （而不是四五年）， 那么学费贵些我们也容易承受。 第三问题的严重性会减轻。

所以三个问题都减轻了。 另外还有一些好处

* 在美国考大学最关键的是最后三四年。 大宝赴美读高中最后一两年， 已经18岁， 比较16岁的大宝更懂事。 爸爸相信大宝学习的自觉性，上进心， 自律， 刻苦， 奋发图强， 力争上游 。。。应该随着年龄 多少有些提高吧。 （一点点提高就不简单）。 力争上游地考大学， 好过懒散地、被逼着考大学。

* 美国学校有欺负同学现象（新加坡也有）。 大宝18岁过去，挨欺负的危险低一点。

* 在新加坡，高中那两年据说是最累的两年， 这是我在华初念书时听老师说的。 大宝到美国读最后一两年可以“逃过此劫”， 轻松一点。 也不是那么轻松， 因为美国高中比初中要竞争激烈得多， 尤其是好学校。

* 俩宝多学几年中文， 尤其是咱家妹妹， 越小越容易学。

* 外公外婆爷爷奶奶可以多几年见俩宝。 我也多几年见老爸老妈。

还有一个可能性 -- 如果我工作受挫，在新加坡待不到 2027， 可以考虑 2025 年 （51 岁）我自己先去美国工作。 2025 年大宝已考完 O 水准，当兵去了。 

--new: consider delaying U.S. emmigration until boy has more self-discipline against drugs

XR said he would show pictures to his kids and drive home the reality about drugs.

Grandpa said stay as far away as possible. I now think boy could stay in SG until age 18

If in U.S., he could attend a religious school or charter school with strict control.

--new: looking at BGC, Phnom Penh, I now feel Singapore (and perhaps Hongkong) will not be overtaken by these cities. There's no visible risk. The probability of that event is close to zero.

I feel KL is much better but still lightyears behind.

I might be biased in favor of Singapore.

--new: family burn rate=far worse]US
modest burn rate – in SG as family
easy burn rate – in US by myself
heavy burn rate – in US as family

As family in US
·         health insurance
·         car ownership
·         housing cost is higher in U.S. than HDB, unless I rent in Edison
·         schooling – private schools or private tuitions

My U.S. peers can’t imagine the low burn rate that’s possible in Singapore. Their cash flow strain is real, not imaginary.

--new: windfall->legacy
I think some windfall-focused property investors are hoping to build a legacy for their kids.

Legacy is valuable to some extent but is a low priority to me. It's good to understand these kind of individual differences.

Over the long horizon, Property markets and my offspring's priorities are too hard to predict.

--new: ##derailers@current ffree "easy life"
My ffree "easy life" would become tough if I face PIP.

If no PIP, then job search obstacles (Re Deepak, CSY, JackZhang, Pinsky, XR) would be the next biggest headache. I would feel trapped and unwanted.

If no such obstacle, then kids' grades would be the next headache.

In contrast, I now believe long commute is actually not such a pain. I somehow got used to the Bayonne 3-segment commute.

Back to ffree state-of-mind... Can I feel comfortable about a SGD 2k burn rate? The more comfortable, the more confident about my bare-bones ffree.

--update blogpost on current income
My 2009 Roth401k voluntary contribution was a regrettable decision. The money is now locked-up when I need it (now).

When the money someday gets unlocked, I won’t need it as much as now.

--new: quality@edu!=measured by college(research)prestige
My first hand experience on quality of eduction : 
UChicago uses all master grads as tutors while NUS strictly employes only PhD holders as tutorial teachers.

MSFM: Two of the most important lecturers were PhD candidates

NUS tutorial class size is up to 20 students, as the 200+ students were divided into tutorial groups. In contrast, UChicago has one big tutorial class.

UChicago has 3-hour lectures, clearly lower quality than the hourly lectures at NUS.

Job interviewers mostly guage aptitudes and to a lesser extent communications/personality. The aptitute needs learning and growing. The primary factor is motivation (beside talent). For this reason, quality of education matters.

For my son, internship would be part of "quality@edu".
--new: ##reasonable, non-essential, addictive foods
For these foods, most of us mere mortals find the wrong-quantity temptation challenging, so I would say "Stay as far away from these foods as possible". 

However, it could be harsh and unrewarding to stay away for too long. I endorse periodic abstinence. I practiec it on ice cream. 

rice
nuts
century eggs
bread with nuts or other plant produce, but without cream
? creamy cakes? not reasonable, usually bad for health
? ice cream
? hummus? Not so addictive

--new: whole fruits beat juice 
fruit juice is more convenient than whole fruits but is inferior because
* many bad ingredients are hidden. 
* juice go bad as fast as half-eaten fruits
* less fiber, less filling
* many fruit flavored drinks are nothing but a regular sugary drink with a bit of fruit flavor additive. Nothing to do with juice at all.

--new: bad substance: degree of harm
when it comes to calorie counting, One of the least noticed math features is
various degrees of "bad" when we decide to loosen up and eat bad food

I feel creamy cakes are among the worst, but for most people, it is probably impractical to completely avoid creamy foods as if they were opium. Various degree of bad -- fried peanut and alcohol are both worse than creamy.. tobacco is worse than alcohol and drugs are worse than tobacco. 

In the mass media, we can see the different attitudes towards different categories of "bad" subtances.

More stupid are the calorie-dense foods that aren't satisfying -- fried peanuts; alcohol; mint ice-cream; cheese chunks; 

--new: buying small packets of nuts
Nuts are OK but not essential 

Slowly get into the habit of eating/buying small packet of nuts. This is based on an honest assessment of my limited self-restraint

--update blogpost
In SG, family meals present the wrong-time and wrong-quantity temptations. Living alone in Singapore, I face only the wrong-food temptation and I have better control.

--new: score each delicious
For each highly attractive food (creamy cakes, flavored nuts,,,) I will record up to 3 scores. (No more than 4 different scores as I would tend to forget.)
* published calorie density vs my own estimate thereof, on my own digestive system, in my own body
* the food's value as a taste-enhancer to encourage me to take in more raw veg.

Case study -- nuts are the prime example of this type -- high published density but lower density in my estimate, and high value as a companion for raw veg. For better enhancer score, I should take only garlic flavored nuts without coating.

Case study -- left-over starch in a delicious starchy food. For example, Red-bean bun or pizza ,,,
I often use these foods to help me take in more raw veg. 
After I eat up the most tasty part, there's the left-over, usually starchy. I always feel a semi-conscious urge to finish the left-over but .. but the satisfaction+reward vs calorie "load" profile simply don't make sense!
 
.. les simportant scores:
* harms and benefits. Few foods have known side effects -- tobacco, trans-fat, alcohol, 

Before I blacklist a highly attractive food, I better decide really how bad it is.
