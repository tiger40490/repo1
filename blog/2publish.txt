-- update bpost on effective endeavor
Another effective intervention #unexpected

Throughout my career and family-building in Sg and US, my personal strategy [decisions, plann/executions, adjustments] about car ownership is .. surprisingly effective. 

Most of my peers "need" a car. They give various explanations of personal needs. It sounds like "so hard to cope without a car in this (part of) country", but I think what they mean is "Since I can afford [1] (to lease) a car, it is proving extremely convenient."

Many point to their own work/home locations, but hey, look at my choice of locations. I chose them to minimize car dependency.

[1] Affordability is personal. I can afford so I do fly up to 4/year for family reunion. Not essential, but a personal priority.

I did spend about USD 1k twice learning to drive. In 2018/19 I also practiced with zipcar. That's part of my effective endeavor.

she recommends joint mgmt with psychologist.
No hurry though.

holiday feast .. soup first;  minimize starch otherwise; limit cakes to 6 pieces/meal (assuming regular size).
I was reluctant to set target, but now I like the idea.

fasting .. I described to her milk + fruits for entire day. If below 400cal/24H, then safe to practice twice a week. My fasting is 600cal+, so no safety concern.

After age 60, can aim for BMI=25, and maintain muscle mass.
Current BMI 21.x is very good for my age.

Going back to 63 kg .. probably not something to aim at.

Why I was able to achieve 65.5 kg .. awareness; conscious self-control.
