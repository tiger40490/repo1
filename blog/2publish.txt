--new: why rental yield varies so much across countries
National culture is one reason (eg: Chinese^American)

Aleris said traffic jam is another reason. BGC workers face huge daily commute if living outside

--new: 2BR^studio in BGC
Contrary to some claims, compared to 2BR, studios are faster to rent out. More affordable to more tenants including students and couples. 

Perhaps 2BR has better windfall but I care more about current income.

--new: Ph rental yield is effectively tax-free !
No one declares it.
Tax department has no manpower for it.

most rental prop owners don't pay tax. If you tell a tax preparer you want to declare rental income, she would ask what amount you prefer to declare. No evidence needed.

--new: PNB accounts
AT-card account 3k maintenance balance. 0.01% pa interest.

Can deposit cash in CashAcceptanceMachine at Infinity branch

CD interest is quoted pretax ... about 0.375% pa for up to P250k. Tax rate is flat 20%

--new: min burn rate during retirement: mostly food
Conceptually, excluding accommodation, bare-bones monthly burn rate would be 50% allocated to food. I would guess roughly SGD 500 out of SGD 1k.

food + public transport + public utilities comprise 70% of that burn rate.

The wildcard is healthcare. In Singapore, outpatient cost might be $50-$100/month

Across developed countries, food cost is rather low relative to income, and possibly falling if we aim at the "basic healthy" level. Public transport and utilities are subsidized because 50% of the households can't afford higher rate on these essentials.

--new jolt: home food is better quality but..
many friends warn me that home cooking use far "healthier" food than commercial cooking.

raw food is safest!

For me, biggest problem is wrong time and wrong quantity, not wrong nutrition

--update blogpost on riverwalk...
CNY eve steamboat in hindsight
:) very very low starch and fried food, against temptation of wrong-food
:) removed all visible fat
:) no drinks
:) lots of veg + tofu for fill-up. Even more fruits
:) threw away jelly leftover by boy

lots of beef, pork and fish. In hindsight, slightly too much beef. Luckily grandma stopped me.

--update blogpost on not left behind ... https://1330152open.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=17035&action=edit

I have achieved a lot (cf my peers) in wellness, ffree, branded degree, career longevity,,, but still, to earn the worldly, materialistic OtherPeople'sEnvy (OPE), I need to move up (or start up). 
This has been the stonewall I hit over and over. 
Not my game, and I gave up years ago.

I think it was wise of me to give up.

Over the years I have been working on the give-up, the stonewall, the OPE, and slowly mellowing up.

Note advanced education credential is an achievement in itself, like a competition title, even if it creates no increased earning.

--update blogpost on git-blogging
on mrt, git-blogging is more productive than smemo or blog printout

similarly, blogging on keyboard is 5 times faster than audio/video blogging or pencil blogging

==new: I pointed out that zbs is vague, compared to QQ and GTD.
Many zbs learning experiences (me or DQH) were arguably irrelevant if never quizzed.

--iv questions on malloc, tmalloc and the facebook malloc
In latency benchmarks, c++ should simply 1) avoid DMA or 2) pre-allocate. Therefore, if the iv question touches on benchmark, then the malloc question become moot.

--iv questions on lockfree in c++
messier and more low-level than lockfree in jvm. I would say lockfree is seldom written by a c++ app developer. Therefore not a GTD topic at all. Purely QQ halo topic.

--iv question on volatile
Again, many interviewers use volative as concurrency feature in c++ but it's non-standard !  Even if it has a side effect if using gcc, the practice is "not something I would recommend", though I won't criticize hiring team's current practice.

--iv question on throwing dtor
c++ standard says UDB but still some interviewers ask about it. So this topic is not zbs not GTD but really QQ

--iv question on debugger breakpoint
Not GTD, not even zbs

--iv question (GS-HK) on CAS no slower than uncontended lock acquisition
I feel I don't need to know how much faster. My knowledge is good enough for GTD

--iv question on how many clock cycles per instruction
no GTD but zbs for a latency enthusiast

--new: the IV successes define me
Without these successes, I am likely to feel a total failure and worthless. I will probably fall into this pit more than once a years -- self-knowledge.
