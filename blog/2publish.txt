--Reusable data structure for many algo challenges
construct a data store to hold a bunch of "structs" in linked list of growing vector (O(1) insertion) 
Then we can build multiple "indices" pointing into the data store

Here are a few average-O(1) indices:
(Note O(1) lookup is optimal)
* hashtable keyed by a struct field like a string
* array indexed by a struct field like small int id
* If there's a small int field having duplicate values, then we can use the same array to get to a "group", and within it use one (or multiple) hashtable(s) keyed by another field
