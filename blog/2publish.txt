Q: AnagramIndexOf (string pattern, string haystack) to return the first index of any permutation of pattern.

Then you need to write real code for innerProduct2SparseArray, assuming the two Tables are already populated according to your spec

Q: add2BigDecimal (string decimal1, string decimal2) to return a string version of the sum. Can't use the python integer to hold the sum, as in java/c++ integers have limited size.
