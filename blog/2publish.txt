--new: low latency: avoid dynamic data structures
RTS uses no STL containers.

In my first programing job, I used C without malloc, because I used only array + struct. If my collection were to grow at run time, then I would have needed DAM. 

I feel low latency generally avoid mid-day DAM. If DAM required, then pre-allocation is preferred.
