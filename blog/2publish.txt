--sufficient^enough
enough can have a negative connotation

-- new: G3 envies
nowadays, what visible signs of "higher ground" do I envy most? BMI and other basis of healthy longevity!

fitness? Not as important as BMI in terms of longevity
healthcare? 
height? A key advantage in marriage market but I'm not on that market. Short people can have better health
branded college? ditto
beautiful wife? Not so important at my age. This was the most potent trigger for envy
nonwork income? this is more potent than brank and salary, but I have basically sufficient.

--update  various blogopsts:
why I have two healthy kids? Largely due to the effective mother
