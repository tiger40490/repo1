--new: conclusions on my mvea era
* Not much positive feedback beside 'providing new, different viewpoints', but Josh doesn't give positive feedback anyway
* should be able to come back to MS
* Josh might remember Victor as more suitable for greenfield projects.
* I think Josh liked me as a person and understands my priorities
* I didn't get the so-called "big picture" that Josh probably valued. Therefore I was unable to "support the floor" when team is out. The last time I was able to happened in GS.
* A few times I worked hard and made personal sacrifices. Josh noticed.
* In the final month, I see myself as fairly efficient to wrap up my final projects 
* Q: was the mvea c++ codebase too big for me? No, given my projects are always localized.

I had a few proud deliveries where I had some impetus to capture the momentum (camp out). 
I think colleagues were impressed to some extent even though other people probably achieved more. Well, I don't need to compare with those and feel belittled. 
This analysis revealed that Josh is not easily impressed. 
Perhaps he has high standard as he didn't praise Rahul either.

* I identified two stateless calc engines in pspc. Seeing the elegant simplicity in the design, I quickly zoom in, stepped over and documented the internal logic and replicated it in spreadsheet.
* my pspc avg price sheet successfully replicated a prod "issue", shedding light into a hitherto murky part of the codebase
* I quickly figure out the serialization root cause of the outage
* I had two brave attempts to introduce my QOT innovation
* My 5.1 Brazil pspc project was the biggest config project to date. I single-handedly I overcame many compilation (gm-install) and startup errors.
