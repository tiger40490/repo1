--new: Raymond on parent`hours spent #Malay
I asked Raymond why Malay students seldom out-perform.
Raymond is confident that IQ is not one of the factors.

He said a key factor is that Malay parents have too many kids and too little spare time outside work (often 1.5 to two jobs). Raymond contrasted the hours he spends with his boys.

Jack He also said affluent families often have full time mom taking care of kids.

-- new: perseverance in U.S. school culture
u.s. pop culture (esp. for kids) is dominated by individual heros powered with determination, optimism, perseverance, fighting on the uphill, against all odds ...

However, the enemy is often a natural adversity (including a biological limitation), or a villain. The enemy is seldom some competitive exam, man-made... Fake enemy, fake achievement.

--new: slow track #another revisit
t_extendedStay
My Macq managers Kevin A and Stephen Keith are fairly successful long-timers. Such an individual would hold a job for 5-10 years, grow in know-how, effectiveness (influence,,,). Once a few years they move up the rank. In their eyes, a job hopper or contractor like me is hoplessly left on the slow track -- rollling stone gathers no moss.

I would indeed feel that way if I had not gained the advantages of burn rate + passive incomes. No less instrumental are my hidden advantages like
* frugal wife
* SG citizenship
* stable property in HDB

A common mistake is missing the silent majority of old timres who don't climb up.

--new: high-flyer burn rate
looking at Rahul, P.Mullins etc -- Capable professionals, but that level of minimum burn rate creates a permanent burden on their shoulders. 

I think the value-investing seminar target audience also feel a similiar burden -- How the hell can I sustain my BASIC $2k/head family lifestyle if I don't want to work so hard for 30Y and then sustain the same lifestyle beyond retirement? Their problem is really the burn rate.

In terms of burn rate, I'm blessed with a frugal wife, SG citizenship ..
