--new: live free of restrictions
I can live with the restrictions of diet, burn rate….but not LiuShuo style self-restraint in corporate context.

I feel the suffering is not worthwhile.

--update blogpost on self-care
what self-care t-spends (don't)work
workout -- is probably the most efficient self-care. Sometimes it lifts my mood, but this time mostly invisible self-care. I need to maintain and hopefully increase the workout.

movies with kids -- generate self-hate, though it sometimes builds some bonding

time with grandpa -- yes self-care

help grandparents with logistics -- not self-care

longer sleep than before -- need to try. Can generate guilt. Can help immunity

tech learning -- might provide some self-care

therapeutic blogging -- is my version of "meditation".

Don't aim to be there for them all the time. I need quiet time4selfcare

--new: y I worry about circuit-breaker extension
fear of productivity drop
fear of losing my cool with kids
fear of self-hate
fear of sustained loss of self-care private hours
fear of overall loss of control

I tend to overlook the improvements in the situation of my family and of Singapore
* improvement in MYS, the supply of Singapore's nutrition
* reduction in new cases in the community
* grandparents secured flight tickets
* I found a sustainable jogging routine

physical presence a few times a day.
bring him out for a walk
talk about kids, and other common interests

gp is more isolated, with very limited emotional support network than gm

gm has more recreation including cooking and 

.. to give gm more support
i tend to give her the cold shoulder and make her feel rejected, hard. 

When she hurts I also feel the pain.

Walk away ... works better than a harsh cold shoulder.

create some warm, soft conversations to offset the cold dialogs

show appreciation for her cooking
