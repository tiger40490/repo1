--new: ##self-care private hour usages
* therapeutic blogging including some emails
* jogging? yes self-care iff in stadium!

Some self-care acts do not require private hour:
* localSys including reviews
* mini exercise? kind of self-care, albeit too short to feel "tough" enough; Doesn't need private hour
* yoga? yes self-care iff in class, not in private
* review tanbinvest blog? guilty, but can do during day time, in another room.
* review jobjob blog? makes me feel doing something to strengthen myself
