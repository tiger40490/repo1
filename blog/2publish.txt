--new: deallocation cost: j^c+++
Based on a brief chat with Martin Thompson..
java has no deallocation cost. C++ deallocation is worse than allocation. Deallocation may use locking if performed across threads.

--update blogpost on locus
if you attribute success to effort, you sound cocky, conceited, vain

--update on c++ guys unlucky.
Out of 100 java guys trying WallSt jobs, 90 are disqualified in tech screening, often in early rounds. Too many weak candidates without depth.

Out of 100 c++ guys trying WallSt jobs, perhaps 70 are disqualified for the same reason. This does NOT mean your chance of success is higher. The opposite is more likely. The remaining 30 get filtered out in later rounds, for reasons like "well-qualified but not a good match, not exactly what we want"

The expertise entry-barrier is higher in C++, due to wider range of essential knowledge. Java is considered more of a commodity skill.

Therefore, it's easier for me to ace the java QQ interview than c++ QQ interview.

--new: price^value when choosing smartphones
price of smartphone depends on
* branding
* component cost such as processor speed, RAM size, screen size, battery capacity
* Is reliability a factor? Not directly. Perhaps the brand and components have an indirect effect

According to my requirements, the "value" of a model depends on
1. reliability
2. screen size
3. battery

--new: 温故知新@blog beats frenDialog 
There's a lot of insight in my blogposts for 温故知新. Arguably more fruitful than email exchanges with friends and reading books.

Email exchange is more efficient than calling friends.

Reading books is more rewarding than reading online.
