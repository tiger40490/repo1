--new? stress profile 2 Sep
Stressor #1 new job ramp up during first month. First month passed with 80% effort. Some visible progress, but a lot more invisible progress.
stressor #2 BGC payment
stressor #3 satisfying sex. Not a destressor ... why? I seem to take it as a basic need but many people don't have it and still feel OK
stressor: I took on the challenge to meet Ms Goh and address boy's math challenge. Stress is largely due to choices 
[*] destressor: blogging as a tool for focus, clarification, zoom-in

[*] destressor: early sleep
stressor: diet and weight? but I started on a new diet under very challenging conditions.
stressor: yoga discontinued ... but I paid for a membership and created a powerful commitment .. highly effective
destressor/declutter: cancelled Everyday ccard; cancelled multiple oc accounts
[*] destressor: SGD expense tracking provided clarity and reassurance
destressor: the HY exposure reduced
destressor: converted USD 5k, as 5k at home is a stressor
stressor: unpacking. luckily I did most of it on 2 Sep
