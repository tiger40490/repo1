If you feel too old or too busy, and don't want these pff complexities, then you pay for advice from banks or financial advisors.

-- update bpost on inflation xp in sg
An easy mistake is to count the recent lunch bills . With a handful of recent experiences of the last year, you get a very "confident" and concrete estimate of the "typical" cost as of this year. 

However, you would very easily forget to control some important factors such as the venue and number of dishes. 
Need to use the same coffee shop food, or the same food court food, or the same Chinatown food. 

--update SRS account in DBS/posb
$15,300/Y max deposit into this account as tax exempt income. Tax saving of more than $2.7k/Y 
After 5Y (say 2030) can withdraw as 2030 income but my tax bracket in 2030 would be the lowest, because first 40k in 2030 is not taxed in Singapore.

Before 2030, During the 5Y lock-in, withdrawal penalty is 5%. 

-- update bpost on buy-without
many purchases were bought-without-OTh but the rmSelf would inevitably become critical and we will remember the purchase as a guilt and failure.
Out of sight, out of mind... I would feel less guilt if I get rid of the physical objects.

-- update bpost on longevity https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=48298&action=edit
In Dec 2023 I started to worry about quality_of_life in my mom's twilight years, either in a Beijing nursing home, or a Singapore nursing home, or living with my wife (while I'm away in the U.S.), against the backdrop of her declining health.

quality_of_life is another side of VV (one of the trio).

All the scenarios appear pathetic, unappealing, scary,,, As people grow old, they are bound to experience (some or all of) mobility decline, mental decline, living away from immediate family, or outside their own comfortable home. Inevitable for many in their 80s and beyond. 

Given an elderly's health, financial and family situation, his choices are often limited. If money is not the problem (willing suspension of disbelief), then perhaps he can live with family + adequate healthcare at home [R.Teo's dad?]. Hopefully (big hope), the in-law caregivers are able to cope, supported by plenty of external resources. This "acceptable" bar is too high to be realistic.

Before I can plan ahead, I have to give up on unrealistic expectations.

How about my ADL insurance? I now feel somewhat more vindicated. 

The more children and grandchildren I have, the more resources I have available in my old age.

-- update bpost on buyback ^ div
Div is funded by profit. Buyback can be funded by debt

Div can cause an immediate price drop. In contrast, buyback has a long-term effect of boosting share price.

Buyback cuts shares outstanding, and usually increase per-share measures of profitability like earnings-per-share (EPS),  and improve performance measures like ROE.

You're not required to sell your shares when a buyback is initiated. If you keep your stocks, your percentage of ownership in the issuing company will increase as other investors sell theirs.

-- new: livelihood shield won't fend off these"pains"
When we Struggle against or Cope with multiple /issues/, we often envy the affluent. We imagine their lives are less stressful, less frustrating, less burdened. Actually, "carefree bubble" depends on many factors such as number of dependents, amount of belongings (baggage), support network (citizenship?). However, this bpost is focused on the factor of livelihood (affluence). 

Even without livelihood issues/worries, some people (including my family-n-fiend) can feel real pains due to 
* physical pains
* psychological pains .. phobia, anxiety, depression...
* serious lack of self-discipline, or substance abuse, or addiction, in the self or a family member. Remember Biden's son.
* wasted personal potential? If livelihood fine, then the "waste" is tolerable?
* failure in love relationships (incl. non-starter)... "Affluence" doesn't meet this need.
* chronic family conflicts .. eg: me vs in-laws; between grandparents; sis vs grandpa
* injustice .. eg: See https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=24197&action=edit
* gross unfair treatment ... eg? losing a /rewarding/ job for a bitter reason like personality, or unfair dismissal

Bias of hindsight/rmSelf.. I would say a lot of times such an "event" does cause livelihood issues "for a while". Could be a few days to a few years. I guess many (rmSelf) dismiss the livelihood "stress" in hind sight, but in the midst of it the stress our xpSelf does feel non-trivial and permanent (just as covid19 felt like in 2020).

How about during the retirement phase? 
* work headaches reduced, but we may miss the engagement, the purpose, the F2F interaction. I would rather stay employed in a light-duty job, and endure some non-trivial stress
* Parenting pains reduced
* family conflict may reduce due to smaller family
* no more personal potential to waste
* I may be more dependent on others

-- trying too hard .. If you aim too high, and try too hard, you will get bruised all over.
I once tried moving up brank, OC-effective. Bruised all over.
quant career .. I made a real attempt for quant career. Too hard. Not worth the effort.
stretch .. In lower middle school I attempted very tough daily stretches. Too painful and unrewarding to continue.
perseverent_foreplay and higher intimacy frequency .. too much difficulty and conflict. I now aim lower... more at peace.
monthly div income .. in early 2010s I was aiming at 1k -> 2k average monthly, using mufu. Such a goal was too high even with U.S. stocks, so I gave up.
grandpa bathing .. grandma was aiming too high, trying too hard to persuade him.
English for wife.. I tried "improving" wife's English grammar and writing. Too difficult. See email in Oct 2023
