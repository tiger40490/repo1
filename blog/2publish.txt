--new: javascript: winds below its wing
I think the new generations prefer online self-services rather than in-person service. They rely on well-designed online GUI, either on smartphone or computer.

--new: commercial banks like FX not eq|comm
FX is closer to the everyday business of commercial banks. The biggest FX banks are usually commercial banks -- DB, Barclays, Citi, never ibanks.

FI is a composite market. Some FI products are closer to commercial banks. I think commercial banks buy-n-hold (not trade) sovereign bonds similar to insurers do.

--new: technology xx is dead
I often hear people say "technology XX is dead" .. exaggerated attention-grabbing gimmick, common on social media user posts.

I like the "dead", old-fashioned, time-honored, stable technologies that are robust (not only resilient) against churn. 

The alternative technologies are use-less, worth-less, hope-less, less proven, low-value, more likely to die young or even dead-on-arrival

--new blogpost: disruptive noSQL 
t_extInput

Long-term trend -- I asked my friend Davis Wei about noSQL displacing SQL. He pointed out that banks need full ACID compliance.

Now I feel the more strict transactional requirement we have, the closer we would move towards SQL. Banking has the most strict requirement.

--new: set up to fail #Nsdq HR
The HR professionals at Barclays Singapore and Nsdq failed to persuade me to accept their offers. They probably feel inferior, inadequate, failed, self-pity. The Nsdq guy was already on his way out, so this could be a double-whammy, reinforcing a false perception of incompetence.

However, the reality is, I was not the right candidate to persuade. The self-pity is mis-directed and groundless.

Now look at my PIP at Macq and Qz. I worked hard towards the expectation but it could be the wrong target for me. I was set up to fail.

--update blogpost on macq .. (tough judge? bonus pool?)
Macq is probably the only job where I focused on localSys GTD but still hit below the bar

the PIP cast a long shadow and left a deep scar. Am still recovering. This scar is deeper than Stirt case.

Remember the abused children, who grew up traumatized? I was not traumatized as a kid. My traumatic experience is still damaging but I can handle it. I have the maturity to handle it.

Adults are often traumatized by failed marriage, in-law conflicts, 

--update blogpost
Q: was the initial 6M ramp-up at Macq effective for localSys, GTD?
A: It helped to some extent. Key is capture of absorbency and engagement. At that time I didn't have a lot to capture :(

--new: what can derail work-till-75 plan
I think health is unlikely to be the reason. IV competition, age discrimination are more likely.

On the job, my energy, absorbency and sustained focus might go down or up with age.
I wrote more in another blogpost -- As I age, brown-field localSys will become harder to absorb. I may need to stay at one system longer.

On the other hand, if offered the chance to convert from contractor to FTE, I may need to resist and possibly move out.

I think my QQ knowledge will remain competitive.

Based on the rumor that west coast is more competitive and age-unfriendly, then the techies there in their 40's can't afford to remain hands-on like on Wall st. If confirmed, then Wall st is better for older programmers.

In fact, beside doctors, Wall St tech might be one of the most enviable domains for work-till-70. Note "tech" also includes BAU and other support functions.

--new: got IV adv@WallSt,not WestCoast
in west coast IV, I have no "unfair advantage" as the employers are open to all. 
In contrast, On Wall St, I have an unfair advantage in the form of
* accumulated IV xp
* accumulated dnlg
* track record .. employers prefer battle-tested
