In this blogpost I will use other metaphors besides "shield". Pillar and levee have unique connotations. 

MLP job is the most fragile of all pillars supporting my carefree ezlife 

SG citizenship is a stronger pillar. Its vulnerabilities are well-understood.
My conserver lifestyle is arguably the strongest pillar.
My wellness
my strong family is an under-appreciated pillar and shield, esp. for the kids.
