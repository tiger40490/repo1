--new: score each delicious
For each highly attractive food (creamy cakes, flavored nuts,,,) I will record up to 3 scores. (No more than 4 different scores as I would tend to forget.)
* published calorie density vs my own estimate thereof, on my own digestive system, in my own body
* the food's value as a taste-enhancer to encourage me to take in more raw veg.

Case study -- nuts are the prime example of this type -- high published density but lower density in my estimate, and high value as a companion for raw veg. For better enhancer score, I should take only garlic flavored nuts without coating.

Case study -- left-over starch in a delicious starchy food. For example, Red-bean bun or pizza ,,,
I often use these foods to help me take in more raw veg. 
After I eat up the most tasty part, there's the left-over, usually starchy. I always feel a semi-conscious urge to finish the left-over but .. but the satisfaction+reward vs calorie "load" profile simply don't make sense!
 
.. les simportant scores:
* harms and benefits. Few foods have known side effects -- tobacco, trans-fat, alcohol, 

Before I blacklist a highly attractive food, I better decide really how bad it is.
