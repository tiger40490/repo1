--new gr8idea: take-up-for-fun: wordy problems
My assumption -- he has lost the basic skills. Pushing him hard will be ineffective.

温和地坚持

On the other hand, he probably needs more perseverance. He has a tendency to give up and puts in fake effort

Note Take-up-for-fun involves (confrontational?) facetime and can create pain (frustration/regret/losing-cool) in me, despite the 'for-fun' slogan.

Biggest problem -- insufficient motivation

I wouldn't see his arithmetic weakness created by years of neglect
I wouldn't say he is so lazy. Perhaps he is more motivated than many kids of another country.
I wouldn't see his poor clarity of thinking and pattern recognition
I wouldn't feel so negative about his tech career

--new: boy said"Don't come home]afternoon"
boy has a point: if i don't come home during lunch break, and instead spend my time in some forgettable way, then i won't feel so disappointed.

The fact that boy is not so competitive at graded exams should not be used as a whip to beat myself up for my decisions to spend time coaching him.

Somehow am not celebrating every small improvement in boy. 

Need to make him see that dad's bar is not too high.

--new: leisure reading ^ blog review
jolt
leisure reading, though fresh content, is less ROTI than blog review.

Therefore, I now allocate close to zero hour each week to leisure reading.

( Tech reading is not same as leisure reading.)

My contractor mentality shows a healthy[1] dose of detachment.

The manager role requires loyalty and is more prone to attachment.

---- new: pay premium2live close2jogg`track #effort hurdle
Compare two homes for sale. AA is 2 minute away from a jogging track (park, stadium .. not roadside), while BB is 10-minute away, perhaps due to a traffic junction.

( I have lived in BB locations many times in my life. )

Most people believe that particular difference is not worth SGD 10k, but now I'm considering 200k, due to the effort required to overcome the "inertia hurdle". If it's easier, however slightly, to work out then many motivated individuals (like me) would work out more.

real eg: As I observed and declared in my 30's, I only need to persuade myself to reach the stadium gate. I don't need to set a (daunting) goal of x minutes of workout. Once I reach the stadium, the chance of me working out for at least 10 mintues is above 99%. The big effort required is really on the "going" not the workout.

related eg: teeth brushing -- when I had two toothbrushes PREpared with tooth paste on them, then my frequency of tooth brushing increased 50-100%.

Therefore, as I age I have more appreciation of the inertia hurdle. This hurdle is human nature, affecting everyone including the "stronger" individuals among us. If you really prioritize exercise as a lifestyle, and you value the amount of "quality" time you spend therein, then be prepared to pay a real amount to live close to a jogging track.

..In terms of long-term motivation and lifestyle improvement, this is more effecive than experiencing a death in the family. The latter can help you overcome inertia for a few months at best.

.. some people consider it overdependency on external resources.
Well, even though some resilient people are strong enough to need no help, most resilient people tend to rely on external help as revealed in WhyFactor.

So in reality, this dependency can be life-enhancing. 

Similarly, seeking help from Cinga counsellors doesn't automatically make me an incompetent parent.
