--new blogpost: I have a problem seeing dabao having fun
I think I have a problem seeing him having fun. I hate to see him enjoying the fun without doing his part.

Both parents probably feel he is too fun-loving. I feel he doesn’t want to earn the right to have fun.

Grandpa felt it’s normal. 

--new: t-spillage]workout
eg: 10 min actual swim takes 30 min in the water, and at least 1 hour total due to commute + shower etc
eg: 50 min yoga class requires about 3H including wind-down.

For these workouts, if you try to reduce the 'spillage' you may hit a stonewall.

eg: jogging has much lower spillage
eg: mini-workout has the lowest spillage

I used to undervalue the Roti of workout
Now I feel prioritizing workout (over other t-spend) means accepting the spillage
