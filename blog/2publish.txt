CSY described the reaction of his 3 India-born contractors when manager anounced in a meeting the termination of their project. Project funding would end very soon.
Mgr promised to try and find other teams, but it's unlikely to have all 3 contractors retained.
CSY felt so much luckier because as perm he would have a job in other projects in the same team.

Therefore, he felt he would consider contract only if salary is 50% higher. Underlying reason -- his age and job search challenges are real. Dev-till-70 is not so easy.

This type of observation/experience reinforces the job insecurity "smell" of the contract career.
