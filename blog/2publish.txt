Property agents, car salesmen, college admission offices ... make huge efforts to impress on us the differences between the haves vs the the have-nots. 

They are careful to position you, the prospective buyer as above average in the market, but below average among their clients. They like to describe their clients as filthy rich, indirectly setting role models for you.
That's a form of mental manipulation. However rich you are, there are always some "existing clients" who are better off!

Now in my late 40s it's becoming increasingly clear that those "haves" have acquired a lot of white elephants.

For example, car is not an asset. 
wines, fancy electronics are not always good for their children's wellbeing

-- update: jenkins 
.. is like IDE skill (including git) -- non-trivial, with some GTD value but zero QQ value, never quizzed
This perception can have a poisonous effect on my localSys xx motivation.
-- new: OC bond mufu
Why the OC mufu is not something to buy-n-hold?
One reason is expRatio. Is there some long-term trend? I don't see it.

Shall we ask some OC senior advisor?

-- update bpost on bpost proliferation
.. My adaptations to the proliferation problem:
more deletion of outdated bposts
git blogging now uses more Update less New
more time spent on fuxi using PubDate adjustment and less time spent creating new bposts
more comments in bpost titles.. In some cases, post title, tag/category are more impotant than the (brief) post content
"fuxi" entries in git blog .. see bpost
