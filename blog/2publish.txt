--new: c++coping with x-lang benchmarks
For c++ to hold its ground in those simplistic, numerical, high volume, speed tests,
* no new no malloc. Use stack and data segment
* no STL no std::string no shared_ptr
* optimize d-cache and i-cache
* use compile-time programming

For java, 
* any GC has some stop-the-world phase, so prevent all GC.

--c++ref: Y we can't take its address
A pointer is conceptually a runtime object, occupying runtime memory, with an address. (Actual implementation, by compiler, of the pointer could be different, but another can of worm for another day.)

A ref is strictly a compile-time symbol and never a runtime object, so it may have no address at runtime. I suspect compiler may replace it with the referent variable.

Such a reference is like a syntactical sugar, mostly for func params. Then came rvr to challenge all of these notions.

--new jolt: wellness to receive more attention....
for a couple of years (2017-2019) I valued wellness higher relative to FOMO, benchmark exams, wealth ...
Now in mid 2020, wellness is retreating to take a backseat. 

How do I change my fundamental perception and belief to get wellness /restored to its rightful place/? I may need to consciously downplay the other preoccupations.

Q: after a yoga/pull-up/diet/bmi improvemenet, how do I derive the same positive feeling (like pride) as derived from an investment success or job offer?

--new gr8idea: take-up-for-fun: wordy problems
My assumption -- he has lost the basic skills. Pushing him hard will be ineffective.

温和地坚持

On the other hand, he probably needs more perseverance. He has a tendency to give up and puts in fake effort

Note Take-up-for-fun involves (confrontational?) facetime and can create pain (frustration/regret/losing-cool) in me, despite the 'for-fun' slogan.

Biggest problem -- insufficient motivation

--update on plowback
zbs and GTD except tool knowledge, are overrated in terms of plowback. In contrast, IV body-building is a worthwhile plowback.
dnlg? Not so effective as plowback.
fitness? Excellent Plowback 
stock investment? Too time-consuming, not worthwhile.
parenting? Yes takes huge amount of time but 90% inefficient in terms of plowback
English (and Chinese) vocab?

..plowback my savings to buy a shorter commute
* increase nonwork income to support lease spread
* spend time (huge amount) helping kids' studies
* save up for 43R model
* save up for a private school in an average school district

--new: exercise for weight loss #WaPo
https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/exercise-does-so-much-for-you-why-wont-it-make-you-lose-weight/2017/08/11/618db370-77d7-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304_story.html claims

“high levels of physical activity seem to be very important for maintenance of lost weight, HIGH as more than an hour of exercise daily."

"Exercise helps keep lost pounds off, but exercise alone can’t do the initial job of losing it."

"To exercise your way out of overeating is impossible."

"To be sure, some people can work weight off, experts say. These include those who exercise vigorously for long periods, and professional athletes, who typically engage in high-intensity workouts. But they are the exceptions. Those high-level workouts are 'not something most people' "

--new: weight-loss supplements: questionable
https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/metabolism/art-20046508 claims

"As you get older, the amount of muscle tends to decrease and fat accounts for more of your weight, slowing down calorie burning."

"Aerobic exercise is the most efficient way to burn calories and includes activities such as walking, bicycling and swimming. As a general goal, include at least 30 minutes of physical activity in your daily routine."

Strength training exercises at least twice a week. Strength training is important because it helps counteract muscle loss associated with aging. And since muscle tissue burns more calories than fat tissue does, even at rest, muscle mass is a key factor in weight loss.

"Don't look to dietary supplements for help in burning calories or weight loss." Manufacturer may cite clinical trials and claim "98%" effective, but the statistics are often weak and flawed. They may use the most obese individuals whose weight fluctuate a lot.
