--new: restaurant: beware raw veg salad
portion size -- is often too small, perhaps a fistful. In contrast, my home-made salad is easily twice that quantity if I choose carrot, cucumber, raddish, tomato... For leafy veg like lettice, the restaurant portion size is bigger than non-leafy, but still dwarfed by my home-made version.

cost -- is too high. Perhaps I'm paying for the cutting, washing, selection of components, serving and the floor space. What I want for my money is just the raw veg.

dressing -- is almost always unwanted. I too add dressing often in the form of porridge, nuts, ice cream

Nevertheless, raw veg salad is usually cheaper than protein dishes, and often healthier.
