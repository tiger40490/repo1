-- update post on creep.
absorb the splurge content.
splurge and creep are comparable. Splurge is faster; Creep is seldome big-ticket items.

mixedVegRice used to be the best value in Singapore, either in coffee shops or food courts. No more.
I used to pick 2 veg or 1 veg 1 meat, for below $3.

Nowadays I eat out only once a month or so. I now pick 3 or 4 items for $4->5-6. I used to flinch at such price figures for mixedVegRice. Now I don't even notice my higher spend. 

The only explanation I have is higher disposable income and lifestyle creep.

Is if for nutrition? No. It's only for pleasure [variety]

Use cpfSA for housing? Impossible
-- new or fuxi: SG credit report
www.creditbureau.com.sg can give a free report.
Better terminate citi credit card to clean up the report. But reapplying would take time.

When you apply for a loan, if you show income without credit card, you will appear risky as a borrower. Lender would hesitate to lend to you since there's no track record. It's better to get a credit card, use it a few times, then apply for loans.

The number that affects your max loan amount is the column-wise total of "unsecured" column of the AggregateMonthlyInstalment table. In my case, I happened to have $50 minimum payment for HSBC card. This $50 went into my total.
==new: revesable decline
I think most wellness declines are irreversable due to aging, but in this blogpost I want to focus exclusively on the exception

-- eye sight .. irreversable
-- chin-up .. I experienced multiple declines. See separate blogpost
-- jogging endurance .. Whenever I restart after a few months, I always felt "heavy" but I usually recover within a few weeks.
-- lower back pains .. recovered
-- heel pains .. recovered. Now I can ran barefoot again.
-- BMI decline
-- flexibility overall decline .. I improved shoulder (back lock) and improved lotus on hard benches or airport/cabin seats

-- update uchicago ending on a high note
without uchicago uplifting, my mental self-portrait would be permanently blemished with tiny scars, labelled with a B .. all due to the NUS grades [2nd class]. 

Look at Venkat of OC and the Shankar of Polaris. No amount of professional accomplishment would be sufficient to overcome that permanent label. The most one can do about that label, is to look at the big picture and refuse to be enslaved by the label.

Should I update the list of j4/ROTI of Uchicago?
