-- new: set in python
set is the least used builtin container. I seldom use it, becasue dictionary is more useful.
( Similarly, list is always more useful than tuple, except when used as dict keys. )

One advantage of set over dict or list -- set-comprehension to create a hashset

-- new: q[return] omitted: common pattern]py
listComp, lambda, interactive shell ... have something in common: the Expression part is the centerpiece. It creates a return value.

--update blogpost on placement new + reCast
I think placement new has two distinct usages
1) for data types with a ctor, it lets you construct those objects (or arrays thereof) at a given heap location without malloc

2) for primitive types like int, it informs the compiler to treat the raw memory as "int", without malloc.

2b) If you call placmeent new with an initializer then it also performs initialization at a heap location without malloc

-- new: java simplifying concurrency
concurrency is tricky. Java tries to simplify concurrency. It did simplify many things such as mutex usage, thread creation,,, but I would say it's superficial simplification.

It reduce complexity level from 9 to 8.5.

Note java concurrency is OO-concurrency. Across all languages, OO-concurrency is usually a wrapper, because core concurrency libraries, concurrency constructs.. are invariably written in C , at a lower level, not OO at all.

-- new: java Future::cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning)
java Future::cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning) would probably use interrupt to cancel a running thread.

If the boolean arg is false, then the thread is not interrupted and would continue running.

I think pthreads define cancellation points, similar to java's interrupt points.

====new: stress@adjustment
t_stress
I have always said adjustment is stressful.

adj can be long drawn-out

All-at-once can make us feel overwhelmed. I tend to relax or suspend some of my adjustments such as diet.

[f=financial]
[w=wellness]
-- adj: [f] burn rate reduction for big spenders. My key advantage over the average Americans.
-- adj: [w] diet restrictions like starch, sugar.. Even salt reduction can add to stress
-- adj: [w] practice daily stretches to slow down loss of flexibility due to aging
-- adj: reduce A/C reliance. Rely on more natural solutions
-- adj: small screen, single monitor
-- adj: restriction on blogging in GS office
-- adj: [f] babysit lots of investments, esp. active management of properties
-- adj: [f] U.S. style DIY home repair
-- adj: wfh during covid19 localSys
-- adj: long commute
-- adj: [w] early sleep .. mild stress, but the adjustment is hard to achieve.
-- some common /lubricants/ and assistance during adjustment:
cash reserve .. $50k adjustment fund after family migrating to U.S.
plenty of paid leaves .. see my le2Gerald

-- new: battle-tested concurrency design
This value is lowest in concurrency design (and implementation).
Probability of observing a bad race is extremely low, so real world experience of "millions of tests" or "decades of successful operation in production" often gives a false sense of reassurance.

Correct design depends on peer review, which is based on the guarantee provided by the underlying infrastructure. When one of the underlying specifications changes, the correctness may be compromised without us knowing. 

-- new: data^information in bigData
Data needs processing before it becomes information.

I feel for high volume, high reliability, integrated, low-level "data" handling, java (and C++) are more suitable. See also https://btv-gz.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=25175&action=edit

For high-level "information" analysis, python and R are more suitable. 

However, in reality my /feel/ might be wrong. Python might have big frameworks comparable to javaâ€™s.

ML Models and techniques are applied on information not raw data.

--new: AI predicting security price
Decades ago, XML was touted as a miracle technology that can treat cancer.

Decades ago, options, swaps and other derivatives were touted as risk-control, risk-reduction, risk-protection products. 

.. Now we knwo better. 

How can AI predict stock price if the price depends on a few traders' decisions?

It's safe to define "price" as the LastTradePrice reported by recognized exchanges. we can pick any major stock symbol (or ETF , or a major FX pair)

In a simplest yet realistic scenario, there's a single $50M block trade executing on a $2B mid-cap stock, over a period of time. This buy order would drive up the price, but Cody the original trader is careful to reduce market impact, by suspending execution once a while. Meanwhile there are intervening events such as index movements, company news, sector news, economic events,,, to muddy the water and conceal the effect of the main driver.

An observing AI robot is unaware of Cody, but Cody knows there are AI robots and sharks out there. So Cody would try to confuse them. Cody also sends visible sell orders (executed or cancelled).

In a more realistic scenario, a stock is removed from Russell 2000. Many index-tracking ETFs would sell the stock. Let's assume our AI robot is unaware of this minor news item, which is likely the #1 driver for this stock price.

In these contexts, how meaningful, how scientific, how smart would be the prediction by our AI ? The mathematics have almost nothing to do with the reality. If you throw in 22 factors such as weather, GDP, unemployment, birth rate, Wechat usage stats, earthquake likelihood, twitter sentiment... a deep-learning robot may pick up some random factor as a driver, when the real driver is absent in the dataset.

--new q[==]/is/equals()
python: hasSameContent(dict1, dict2): return dict1 == dict2. Java would use equals()
object identity equality : python uses "is". Java uses ==
c# is more complex

--new: lowLatency@multicore: mostly STM
Low latency on a multi-core machine would probably use a lot of threads in STM

Synchronization is the bread-n-butter of multi-threading. as a skill it is all about shared mutable -- improving performance in the presence of shared mutables. However, low latency frowns upon shared mutables.

--new: accept risks, not wholesale shutdown
eg: bedbugs. spraying and washing everything fabric, replacing all furniture.. doesn't buy you waterproof protection.
eg: covid19 lockdown. Even with full lock down, there's no such thing as riskfree.
eg: iPhone8 lock up
eg: overseas rental properties... I accept the risks rather than a blanket rejection. In any rEstate market, there's nothing riskfree.
eg: some stock investors only buy known names, but that doesn't protect them from capital loss. In this context, there's nothing riskfree.

-- update blogpost https://btv-gz.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=38769&action=edit
CSY described the reaction of his 3 India-born contractors when manager anounced in a meeting the termination of their project. Project funding would end very soon.
Mgr promised to try and find other teams, but it's unlikely to have all 3 contractors retained.
CSY felt so much luckier because as perm he would have a job in other projects in the same team.

Therefore, he felt he would consider contract only if salary is 50% higher. Underlying reason -- his age and job search challenges are real. Dev-till-70 is not so easy.

This type of observation/experience reinforces the job insecurity "smell" of the contract career.

-- new: Vishal discussion
I thought Vishal would be wise to move earlier out of PMW to a more lucrative domain. 

I thought Vishal has the soft skills and political skills to move up. In the end he chose move-out rather than move-up.

I thought Vishal would be one of the key individuals to get well-compensated by GS (to keep him loyal). He said he was in a few years but overall paid below the market.

Vishal described some geopolitics which affected the compensation, promotion, workload...

I feel shaming was a big whiplash used in PWM. ( Now I feel Stirt tech used some shame, as I was unable to meet the VP benchmark.) Beware: Shame is usually a ping-pong -- If manager sends a signal but I refused to respond, then shaming is less effective.

peer benchmarking is shaming if too explicit....

For contractors, manager is less likely to use motivation techniques including shaming. Emotionally tiring... If she does, the contractor is more free [1] to quit, more so than H1b employees.

[1] In his home country, Vishal also has more freedom. )

Many GS techies simply quit after seeing the workload, the compensation, the expectation, the motivation/whiplash. As Vishal described, most of them has found happiness since they left.

mutual responsibility .. Both employer and employee have some responsibilities over the bad outcome, be it shame, burn-out or health issues. As in the "homeless" discussion, it's unfair to blame the system only, and never look inside the self.

I asked Vishal -- do you get used to the high stress of VP? 
Josh seemed to be very cool.

Vishal said that even though he became better at handling the work, it was still too much. The demands and expectations were probably increasing on him. Move up or move out. I think he was benchmarked with other VP's 

As to urgency, I now feel Josh is confident to cope with virtually all the incoming issues. Unconsciously he assigns a urgency level to each so he is never overwhelmed 

-- new: enjoy tasty food without BMI impact as in NY
I wish I could enjoy my nice food without the BMI impact.

In 750/7 MS office I achieved it. So now Iâ€™m following the same techniques
* low starch ... almost same as in 750/7
* high fruits + raw veg â€¦ almost same as in 750/7

I guess whatâ€™s missing is the home meal control. My grip is loose. The wrong-time temptation is way too powerful at home.

When I see the nice food at home, itâ€™s a struggle to resist. No such temptation or struggle in Bayonne home.

-- update or new: tempting foods
Stash-away creates an unwanted, almost hazardous temptation at home, but it is effectively a delay tactic. buy-n-store is still better than eating rightaway

--new good appetite could be a bad thing
t_jolt
In my twilight years (80+?), I wish to have a good appetite to enjoy healthy food. At my current age, a lower appetite is life-enhancing.
At any age, appetite for unhealthy food is a sign of bad genes.Â 
In reality, most foods fall into the grey area between healthy and unhealthy.

-- new: delay first+last meals
I have realized one of the top 3 simple rules of fasting is to delay the first and last meal of the day as much as possible.

As soon as I break the fast (breakfast:), the floodgate is usually hard to close.

--new: western men overrated
at Shangrila, I saw many white men (also some Asian men), mostly fathers in my age group.
Mostly affluent families, based on my guestimate and intuition.

However, they don't seem to have the highest level of wellness that I used to associate with white men.

My decade-long inferiority is now put into question.

In terms of brbr, I have reason to believe I'm in much better "shape". The same evening, I discussed the same topic with the LZ.Yu family. For some individuals, excess cash balance is like desserts left in a fridge... will disappear sooner or later.

--update blogpost on wechat vs mail
email is Much better than wechat voice mail for me... can archive, search, can respond a few days later at my own pace. 

I'm not sure but I guess some people might be using wechat voice mail too much for their own good. Voice mail can add stress to one's life because it is harder to manage compared to paper mail, email, online chats, mobile text message or in-person chat. (Note I do use voice mail myself, and I think they are valuable in some contexts.)

With a voice mail, if you don't respond, it just piles up in a tiny screen with 20 other voice mails (among 100 text messages), without any textual clue about their contents. It's unmanageable IMO. Therefore, the recipient is forced to respond right away. Unnecessary urgency, unnecessary stress. 

Maybe young people use wechat voice mail in a different way. (I won't speculate how or why.) I always prefer to receive messages with subjects and have the option to warehouse it until free to deal with it. Voice mail is unmanageable in my system.

Q: Can protein powder replace a meal?
With plenty of ice (chia seed is secondary) it did fill my stomach AND provide energy. However, the wrong-time temptation is overpowering for this poor substitute of a traditional meal
I think key is starch. Protein powder has no starch. chia, ice, protein powder can provide a full meal, but if you have had no starch for a while, then the temptations simply wipe out everything and you can feel hungry (hedonic) again. This is the nature of our senses. 

Try adding some cooked green beans, corn or rice into the smoothie
