--new new blogpost: over last10Y no$roti2branch out@java because..
So far, we java developers were lucky so we see no financial gain in diversification.

I feel someone like Mithun has low motivation to deep dive outside java so their breadth and depth would be (not slightly) limited
--new blogpost: ##RDBMS=architect's toolkit
stored proc can _greatly_ simplify business logic as the business logic lives with the data ...

Even without stored proc, a big join can replace tons of application code implementing non-trivial business logic
hashtable lookup can be implemented in SQL (join or sub-query) with better clarity and instrumentation.
Much fewer implicit complexities in initialization, concurrency, input validation, null pointers, state validity, invariants, immutabilities, ... 
OO and concurrency design patterns are often employed to manage these complexities, but SQL can sidestep these complexities.

Modularity is another advantage. The query logic can be complex and maintained as an independent module (Note on the presentation layer, javascript offers  modularity too). Whatever module dependent on the query logic has an dependency interface that's well-defined and easy to test, easy to investigate.

In fact testability might be the most high-profile feature.

I think one inflexibility is adding new column. There are probably some workarounds but noSQL is still more flexible.

Another drawback is concurrency though there are various solutions.

--new new new blogpost: java perf^simplicity
Paradoxically
java's syntax simplicity is on par with python, better than c# and much better than c++. Paradoxically, 
java's performance is on par with c# and c++, largely due to JVM and JIT

java has been popular on web servers, and crucially the newer mobile, cloud, big-data platforms, beating c++, c#, python

java's adoption rate as a foundation platform or integration-target... is better than all other languages. 
Many products are built for java, on JVM or with java in mind. 
I'm deliberately vague here because I don't want to spend too much time analyzing this vague, general observation.
s algo is conceptually simpler.

--new blogpost: decline of quant-dev: low value-add
Q: why quant jobs used to be more abundant and pay a premium even though the economic value-add of the quant skill has always been questionable. 
A: because the traders made money and subsequently received a big budget. Now budget is lower.

Same can happen to quant traders.

Some UChicago lecturer once commented that everyone should get some quant training as every high school student does math. I think it is not necessary.

I am more theoretical and was naturally attracted to this domain but the value-add reality soon prevailed.

Tech shops love algo challenges and speed-coding which have dubious value-add similar to the quant skills. However, the hot money in tech sector is bigger and last longer. 

--update blogpost on take-home coding iv:
ensure file timestamps are all within a short window. Prefer to use fewer files

if I claim 2H, then leave some rough edges

If using c++ then show off some TMP hacks

do i need to implement user edits?

do i want to spend many more hours on a thread-pool async solution? yes this would be fun
--new blogpost: top locations: often rental-only
My favorite locations are often rental apartments -- best connectivity, car-freedom, clean streets. 

In Chinese-centric cities, those locations would become condo towers for sale. In U.S. renters are willing to pay very high rentals.

--new blogpost: highRiskHighReturn #Jill
AsiaPropertyDev has  current campaign to pay 20% in Y1, 21% in Y2 ... 24% in Y5 if client commits 50k. Last payment is 50k * 124%.

I told Jill this contractual return is too high and a sign of desperation but Jill said CEO adjusts campaign features constantly.

I shared with Jill my observation -- once a while a reputable company disrupts a mature market with drastically reduced cost to customers, aiming to capture huge market share
