-- new: Channel500 [USD500/D for foreigners]
Original purpose is "SAFE assumes a foreigner has converted USD to RMB. Now you are allowed to convert back to USD"
HSBC actually requires proof of the earlier convert. 

Money changers (much faster) support $1k/D, while banks only allow $500

Each passport holder must be present at the branch. 

Q: is it illegal to exchange for USD 1k every day?
A: clearly legal and not prohibited

Each bank usually starts rejecting your request before SAFE intervenes. You can then go to another bank.

The Xiamen lady June.Zhang told me it's ok to exchange for USD 1k/D at her money changer, higher cost than at banks, but more frequency supported.

Q: what if I get on the SAFE watch list
J.Z: SAFE approval is required during the cash exchange. If SAFE real time system identifies the customer's ID (passport or IC) as a watched ID, then the guy will be turned away. There should be no criminal charge for 1k/D alone without some suspicious activities

Q: what if I get on the radar but not the watch list? No answer.
J.Z: her money changer firm is authorized to sell USD to such a foreigner. China citizens are monitored more than foreigners.

-- update icbc::gm
For small transfers (up to 200k), you can choose 快捷认证 vs Udun认证. Better practice each periodically, with 备注 like "udun test"

Udun i.e. hardware token
* required for large (200k+) transfers, but can be used for small transfers for a test-drive
* needs bluetooth
* Udun device PIN .. 爷爷 奶奶 大宝
* charging cable ... is a standard cable. Can last 2Y without recharge
* one hardware token ties to one icbc account, possibly usable on two phones

transfer limits: yearly .. 1100k fine; monthly 510k fine; daily reduce to 200k

-- new: Grandma's j4w4reserve
j4w4 means 境外. 境外reserve belongs to LSQ 100%

I will keep track of each transfer from grandma's ICBC to 境外reserve, and record 境外reserve balance, always in RMB. Physically, 境外reserve will be backed by RMB and USD assets in Singapore banks, under my ame.

After my project1560, any "surplus" RMB expatriated will go into 境外reserve.

When SGD/RMB drops and RMB DIR improves, I may convert some SGD to RMB and deposit into 境外reserve. This transaction will change the backing asset composition, but not RMB balance of 境外reserve.

-- update channel520
Safe to carry 30k. If caught (rare), you can walk back to departure and deposit at ATM machines.

PEK T3 departure CCB machine can accept cash deposit

-- update which bposts on max out cpfLife (P1?)
payout will start at 65. I wish to receive higher payout, to strengthen livelihood security. That requires me to top up to ERS at 55, 65 or sometime in between.

If I hit ERS at 55, then liquidity suffers! I lose some 250k liquidity for 10Y! I may need that money for kids' education, a new home etc...

Q: can both of us hit ERS? Unlikely because it would require SGD 1000k cash.
Q: so who has priority to hit ERS? Me since my payout starts early, but she would feel more secure if payout is under her name.

-- new: sustainable long-term return{annities
I have bought three annuities. Additionally, cpfLife is a "descending annuity"

Q: what's a sustainable (annualized) return before expensens?
%%A: 4 ppa

Note this return rate is very different from (usually higher) the more visible payout_rate.

HsbcLWA seems to feature 8~9 ppa. I think it's unsustainable.

-- new: reality of temp jobs 4me+youth
I tend to perceive temp jobs positively, as learning.

many unlucky job seekers end up working on temp jobs. No job security, low pay, limited trec
eg: Chinese immigrants to Canada
eg: Shuo in 1997 after graduation
eg: my temp jobs in 2005
eg: many of the jobless 2023 graduates from China universities

If you don't worry about livelihood, then you can enroll in a training program instead.

-- update bpost about sanctuary... or addicted...
During the smashing episodes, I relied on office as a sleeping place. More importantly, during that crisis, I came to office 7 days a week and shifted focus to a demanding task at work. A healthy shift.

Some office tasks are too demanding, too stressful, but I have found other office tasks quite manageable, and a wholesome, welcome diversion.

Beside the "tasks", the physical environment of the office is a sanctuary, a harbor for me.

I hate tiresome commutes including multi-transfer commute. Red and Green lines are integrated with quick transfers.

Q: can we increase statin to reverse CAD?
For any CAD patient, plaque build-up is hard to reverse. No reliable evidence of any effective treatment.
I once reached LDL=51. It was safe. 
Reduce LDL to 70 for a few years, and you might see reversal.
Ezetrol is safe.
Repatha is proven to reduce LDL and heart attack risk. But plague reversal using Repatha is unproven.

Q: can I go on extreme diet to reverse CAD?
A: not recommended, but it's safe to reduce all fatty foods.

Q: atherectomy ?
A: Singapore uses coronary atherectomy too, but only for very tough plaque, not really for reversing my level of CAD.

early sleep .. boy's noise... light sleeper.
AA: bring boy to see me (Dr Leow). Late sleep can increase risk of heart attack.

My mom takes blood pressure daily. Yes she needs it. Do I need to buy a device to check at home? No

Q8: Was my progression that fast over 3 years? from zero to 50%? Perhaps not zero 3Y ago?
AA: correct. There could be some blockage in 2021.

Q8b: Will it continue at a slower pace if I take these medications? A: Yes!
Q8c: But slower pace still implies I may need stenting in a few years?
AA: possible. All depend on on periodic ESE results

Over 20Y horizon, stent failure rate is 10-20%, so 80%+ of stent patients don't need rework for 20Y+.

Q: Yoga and pilate workout can feel difficult (heavy breathing), but are they lighter than jumping exercises? 
AA: Yes

Do I need to learn how to recognize angina?
A: there are many angina symptoms including some minor discomfort
A: GTN not effective for me. Tablets like aspirin blood thinner are also unsuitable since it can backfire in some cases
%%A: I believe GTN and tablets are not needed for my current level of risk. For some reason, doctor won't put it that way.

After checking my blood results and blood pressure, Dr Lew said that given my age, I will need stent in a number of years, but the longer we can safely put it off, the better, as stent technology will improve.

Is my sildenafil affected by the three drugs you prescribed? 
A: No. 
A: GTN + sildenafil is proven dangerous

Q: future CT results will need to be interpreted with this FFR report?
A: Standard CT will not be suitable.. wait for newer technology

Q: how do I monitor the build-up over next 10y?
A: ESE (exercise stress echo) every 2Y, or 1Y minimum
A: Standard treadmill test will give false positives.

What can I do about hypertension risk? I guess same as everyone else i.e. manage risk facctors

I have gastritis ... so some blood thinners are unsafe? 
AA: Even aspirin can be safe, if taken after (within 15m or with) meal

How do I watch out for liver damage due to Lipitor? 
AA: blood test every 6M

Is my blood pressure likely to rise? 
AA: yes but only due to aging, not stent

Q: will stent procedure leave the smaller plagues (below 50% blockage) untreated? Will they build up? Improvement is impossible.
AA: Scenario 1: doesn't build up over many years
AA: Sceanrio 2: worsening.. further intervention

How safe is chin-up, or push-up, skip-rope etc? AA: safe after wrist heals
How safe is climbing stairs and squat? AA: yes after 2 weeks
How safe is slow run up a small hill? AA: safe
How safe is 100m continuous swim? AA: safe
Most people need 30min of aerobic exercise 5 times a week... How aobut me? AA: same for me

grapefruit juice can interfere with statin but grape juice is safe

nuts and peanut-butter can be beneficial?
AA: eat in moderation. Better than fried or coated peanuts.

What causes do you see? 
AA: genetics + aging

For young men with family history, start checking cholesterol after 20.

Is atherectomy a safe option for me?
AA: higher risk. Good option when it's necessary (lesser of two evils) such as hardened plaque. 

Q: What if I miss 1 or 2 times a week?
AA: don't double up on the next day

Q: how do I know that work stress is actually affecting my heart health?
AA: chest tightness, short of breath while climbing even short stairs
Q: how about mild discomfort around the heart
AA: yes can be a sign

Q: competitive running/jogging .. fall at the end? Yes dangerous to the heart. Immediate medical attention required.
AA: Aim at endurance and don't sprint. Maintain pace. 
%%A: My younger-day habit of all-out sprint in the last lap is no longer safe at my age

Q: In early Apr, you told me my risk of heart attack is quite high so I need an angioplasty within a month. Is my risk profile improved so much that I don't need to constantly worry about heart attack?
A: After the angiogram, my risk of heart attack is below 1% within 1-2Y. Blockage is at most 50% despite what he wrote in the discharge summary.

Q: test for insulin in blood in addition to hbA1c, to guage my risk of diabetes?
A: no need

Q: EDyw since early 2023 .. could it be due to my plaque build-up?
A: possible, but any man above 45 has increased risk.

workout 
.. 20km without pushing to the limit? No recommended
.. can I train for JPM5600 2025? yes

Q: CoQ10 .. good for me if my mom asks me to try?
A: harmless but probably not needed given my medications

My bubble has yet to derail or puncture.
Now, among the non-overweight, there is a high probability of muscle loss. I am good so far.
By now, I have largely avoided the "magnetic field" of overweight. My enviable BMI can come at disproportionate cost
* Older adults often need to fight, on their back heels, an uphill battle to retain muscles. Losing muscle can reduce your BMI but it also affects your metabolism rate
* amputation can reduce your BMI, but do you want that?

-- update bpost on long-term SG inflation
K.Hu suggested roaming retirement to Malaysia. Singapore is susceptible to imported inflation but not Malaysia.
Switzerland citizens don't have a next-door neighbor as a low-cost retirement destination. (Spain?) Sgp has JB.

Some x% annual inflation over some 15Y translate to perhaps 50% commulative inflation in Sgp. Malaysia cost level is much lower and will address that level of commulative inflation.

SGX blue chip stocks are an inflation hedge. 

STI ETF? has expRatio, inferior to single names

SP500 ETF is a classic inflation hedge.

A similar experience to share -- Mixed vegetable-rice (杂菜饭) is my default choice when I eat alone. In June 2024 I went to a low-cost street venue (without Aircon), and bought a regular 杂菜饭 -- two-veg-one-meat for $5.50. Used to cost $3.50 ~$4, perhaps 10 years ago. 

For a historical comparison I need to hold every variable constant:
* location .. food court (with Aircon) is my current default. Frequently, I do choose cheaper place like this June venue
* portion .. one-meat-one-veg-on-rice (一菜一肉) is my default. Frequently, I do get 1 or 2 additional items like this June case

$2 was my cost level some (20) years ago. Now the same food costs $3.50 minimum. When I see a price display of $6 for 杂菜饭, I get a sinking feeling (心里一沉) and immediately urge myself to cut down to two-veg-on-rice. Less often, I would tell myself I'm not really hungry and can wait until I reach office or home, where low-cost healthy foods await.

Q: how much would the same food cost (in the same place) in 2035? Probably below $7. My optimism.

My son may start working full time in 5 years, without a degree, and make $3k/M. $6 a meal translates to about $15/day. With that salary he has to cut down on food cost.

Even though food is an essential expense, food inflation is my least worry because ... many (reasonably healthy) choices exist. In contrast, I care more about medical, housing+utilities, public transport.

If 15GB insufficient for wife, we can buy additional "data pack" for one month.

Once you buy, it auto-renews monthly. That's the official (bad) answer. Such a "deal" is inferior to a bigger monthly plan. However, in reality, monthly data packs are better due to flexibility. You can cancel auto-renewal after one month.
