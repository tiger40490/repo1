--new: biggest c++ coding projects
In 2015 I played with the idea of apply for a $5k salary DBS job just to get big-project c++ dev experience.

The idea of "big" depends on the skill you want to demonstrate or learn.

If you mean build tool for large codebase then MS is largest, followed by Macq MTS. 

If you mean actual source code size that demonstrates data structures, algorithms, BestPractice, then my NYSE integrated feed parser is largest 
followed by my weekend coding interview projects.

It's worthwhile to review those projects
