--new: Eng: young children vs children
Technically, a child can refer to a grown-up child.

--new: 
"household" can mean single-person or family

--new: j4 returning char instead of void return
If there are many exit points including catch clauses, breaks from nested loops, and there are clean-up clauses at loop-ends, then void return is a loose design and /breed/ invisible coding errors like returning unintentionally.

--new: json format/syntax
Basic rule -- name:value pairs. Name is (always?) a primitive string. 
Value can be array (horizontal), jsonObj (vertical) or primitives. As the ancestor of javascript, C language introduced array and struct.

array of jsonObjects are enclosed in []; jsonObj is enclosed in {} and consists of name:value pairs

Note array can only appear as a value in a name:value pair.

A jsonObj can be a field of an enclosing jsonObj, or can be an array element. In both casee, it is the value of a name:value pair. 

--new cash flow high-ground^low-ground
I like the visual (albeit loose) concept of "cashflow higher ground"
Each househould (single or family) can move between lower ground and higher ground as life unfolds. Even a country can go through the same, as SG did during covid19.

On a low ground, household outlays exceed income, debts exceed assets, debt servicing is a major recurring expense, or salary income stability is in doubt. Some households sink lower and lower, apparently unable to escape. As a contrast, Jack Zhang lost his job and then hit the pandemic, but thanks to his savings and low burn rate, he probably didn't sink further.

Personal prognosis -- If I were to take on a USD 700k school-district house, I would slide into lower ground, partly due to high interest and property taxes. 

In a down turn such as a pandemic, the lower grounds are more at risk of overrun.

On the higher ground, I feel a need to build up my defense, strengthen my foundation, and raise "my ground" even higher.

What type of insurance protect my high ground? Not endowment, not life insurance. My focus is Disaster insurance such as TPD, major medical and eldershield. These are rare events so hopefully successful claim rate is low and premium is low. Such low-cost insurance plans help strengthen the foundation of my high ground. Recall the tallboy vs K3 story?

On the lower ground, people struggle to cope. On the higher ground, you can enjoy, relax and live in relative peace and comfort.

! Even a middle-lower income household can achieve cash flow high ground, by reducing burn rate, debt,,

--new: 30-min chunks WFH
I need to break up my time into half-hour chunks. Aim at one productive chunk with 2 other chunks

Q: why I spend so many hours at work but not get enough done?
A: I may realize that I actually do finish quite a lot of work in some of those chunks.


--starhub mobile renewal: Two choices
AA) wait for expiry of current contract, then renew online to start a no-contract plan
BB) accept the email offer and start new 1Y contract right away

Between AA and BB plan quotas, no difference except 15^25 GB. I don't need this data so I would prefer the flexibility in AA.
:) CND + weekend data -- same between the two choices

--update blogpost on self-care
what self-care t-spends (don't)work
workout -- is probably the most efficient self-care. Sometimes it lifts my mood, but this time mostly invisible self-care. I need to maintain and hopefully increase the workout.

movies with kids -- generate self-hate, though it sometimes builds some bonding

time with grandpa -- yes self-care

help grandparents with logistics -- not self-care

longer sleep than before -- need to try. Can generate guilt. Can help immunity

tech learning -- might provide some self-care

therapeutic blogging -- is my version of "meditation".

Don't aim to be there for them all the time. I need quiet time4selfcare

--new: y I worry about circuit-breaker extension
fear of productivity drop
fear of losing my cool with kids
fear of self-hate
fear of sustained loss of self-care private hours
fear of overall loss of control

I tend to overlook the improvements in the situation of my family and of Singapore
* improvement in MYS, the supply of Singapore's nutrition
* reduction in new cases in the community
* grandparents secured flight tickets
* I found a sustainable jogging routine

make time and create mental energy reserve by reducing the fixation on boy.

physical presence a few times a day.
bring him out for a walk
talk about kids, and other common interests

gp is more isolated, with very limited emotional support network than gm

gm has more recreation including cooking and 

.. to give gm more support
i tend to give her the cold shoulder and make her feel rejected, hard. 

When she hurts I also feel the pain.

Walk away ... works better than a harsh cold shoulder.

create some warm, soft conversations to offset the cold dialogs

show appreciation for her cooking

--new: mainstream solution is often grossly inferior
earliest example: English vocabulary building as baptism by fire? My Singapore teachers/classmates suggested reading newspapers but actually dictionary-browsing proved far more efficient and effective

early eg: personal note keeping? When I bought my first computer in 1998, mostly to keep personal notes, I found the mainstream solution of MSWord was far inferior to ascii files

personal eg: to protect my c:\0 from my son's windows account, the mainstream solution of windows folder security was overcomplicated. See ...
eg: U.S. medical insurance is overcomplicated compared to national healthcare systems in other countries. 
eg: U.S. medical billing/coding is overcomplicated. In contrast the Singapore system is much simpler.
eg: GUI programming? html + browser (before javascript) proved so much simpler than client-server

eg: my very first paid programming job was rather mainstream -- Excel + ftp, but the nascent CGI proved far better documented, more reliable...

eg: file system security?  Microsoft solution is overcomplicated compared to unix. I thought the Microsoft solution was mainstream
eg: config files? Unix tradition uses individual text files per application, much simpler than windows registry. I thought the registry design was mainstream (see my blogpost on registry)

--new: unexpected success with home wifi set-up
* tip: cable point need at least 2 power sockets to support 4 to 6 devices -- modem, router, powerline networking, phone
* tip: place the devices high up, to free up table space. Most devices (except phone) should be shileded from access
** to achieve this, I chose wall-mounting rack
* minor tip: place wifi router in the open living room. Best practice is ceiling-mount. If not possible, consider powerline networking.
* tip: install power sockets higher up throughout the house
