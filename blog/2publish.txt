--new: ice-cream: buy expensive popsicles
Some ice cream popsicles are tiny and expensive. 
When we buy this product (rather than the big tub), we are "persuaded" to eat less ice-cream each time, and more slowly. Without the popsicle packaging, I would probably eat 5 times in one sitting.

--new: BMI L@ctrl: self-care^self-hate
a big part of my cabin fever is diet loss@control, esp. the wrong-time temptation.

I'm used to be in control, so the loss of control is devastating, degenerative and destructive.

self-hate, unreasonable expectation are part of the underlying.

What we need is compassion and self-care. In my preoccuation with BMI, I fail to recognize and celebrate the huge effort and success in
* avoid family meal when not hungry
* starch
* fat
* raw veg + fruits
* chia seeds

Pehraps my diet is not lost, but BMI battle is in decline. If that's the case then we need the bao3shan1 strategy.

Perhaps the increased calorie intake (presumably due to starch and fat) is directly due to coping with stress

Perhaps what I need is intermittent fasting or warrior diet. Go without starch/fat for 16H everyday.

--new: live free of restrictions
I can live with the restrictions of diet, burn rate... but not LiuShuo style self-restraint in office context.

I feel the suffering is not worthwhile.

I don't feel self-confident I can "improve" myself.
