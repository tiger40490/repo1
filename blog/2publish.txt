--new cooked: open-house blogging choices

under t-pressure don't curtail blogging

However, I follow a coping strategy that relies on blogging a.k.a. reflective, expressive writing. 
It’s crucial to recognize blogging as both a t-spend and a relief.

Blogging is crucial to my stress mgmt and crisis mgmt.

blogging is a pillar. I can't afford to "cut t-funding" on these pillars.
