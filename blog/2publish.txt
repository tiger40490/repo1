--new: complacent guys]RTS #Deepak
Deepak told me that Rahul, Padma etc stayed in RTS for many years and became "complacent" and uninterested in tech topics outside their work.

I think Deepak has sharp observation.

I notice many Indian colleagues uninterested in zbs or QQ topics. That's a fundamental reason for my QQ strength on the WallSt body-building arena.
I think many of them learn the minimum to pass tech interviews.
CSY has this attitude on coding IV but the zbs attitude on socket knowledge 

If you regularly benchmark yourself externally, often against younger guys, you are probably more aware of your standing, your aging, the pace of tech churn, ... You live your days under more stress, both negative and positive stress. 

I think these RTS guys may benchmark internally once a while, if ever. If the internal peers are not very strong, then you would get a false sense of strength.

The RTS team may not have any zbs benchmark, since GTD is (99.9%) the focus for the year-end appraisal.

These are some of the reasons Deepak felt 4Y is the max .. Deepak felt H1 guys are always on our toes and therefore more fit for survival.

--new: Ashish/MLP IV: QQ^GTD
I feel Ashish's MLP IV experience again proves the relative importance of GTD vs QQ

His GTD capacity is evident, but high-end interviews always discount/dismiss GTD and focus on QQ instead, including "problem-solving" as the young bbg interviewer put it.

Tanvil's self-description is revealing, but Ashish is a better example as I know him better than I know other peers.

Viswa is another example. 

GTD superstars are typically not recognized experts. They fail the expertise-benchmark.
