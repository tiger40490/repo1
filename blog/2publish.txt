-- slow cooking update 4 def@success or new: quiet idle time
Let's give shortcodes to the 4 definitions
successE: ezlife...
successZ: zqbx
successL: legacy, lasting achievements
success1: the first and most common def@success

Q: At my age and my level of ffree, why do I still worry about coblood waste, and too much idle time?
A: Well, ezlife is not "complete" success as it captures one dimension of success. zqbx is another crucial dimension of success

Time wasted in pain, or other unintended wastes of time are always regrettable and should be minimized. 
Time wasted due to inefficiency is questionable.

Planned idle time can be free of pain.
I guess LKY in his twilight years decided to learn meditation.

To me, quiet idle time is a prolonged period of doing nothing, free of extraneous stimuations. Boredom can be good, as a BBC program reported.
I guess quiet idle time can be a deeper recharge but today I will assume this deeper recharge doesn't work for everyone.

I think quiet idle time is not bad for some retirees and some younger people. So far, I have limited appreciation for quiet idle time.  Jacob of ERE pointed out the "freedom TO" challenge. 90% of the time, I still have goals, and purposes and I still push myself towards them. 
One growing purpose is the need to live longer for my kids. (Longevity requires long-term effort, practice and time.) I feel I can add value to their lives. If I live longer, I can better control my surplus assets and decide how to use it to help my children and possibly their children.

Healthy longevity may benefit from quiet idle time, not strictly traditional meditation.

A quasi idle time is the broad category including musical instrument, calligraphy, painting/drawing, wife's handcrafting, knitting

-- slow-cooking update post on Jiang.Zhu
Consider JackZ and Raymond's situations. At my age and (my economic) level, what endeavors (spaceshuttle name) are really strategic?
1) wellness lifestyle improvements like yoga, sustainable diet habits, BMI
2) dev-till-70 accu, plowback,,, including QQ and CIV
? academic parenting? No. I prioritize motivation, bonding, coaching 
? prepare for relocation to U.S. including car ownership, burn rate control

Jiang.Zhu is an unknown CTO/LeadEngineer figure that I last met in 1991. Both him and the Fenix CTO are mostly unknown personalities, so my mental picture of them are imagined and fabricated content fitted onto a half-skeleton i.e. a handful of bones

I guess for both of them, there is still a lot of untapped potential, a lot of drive, ambition. Compared to them, I probably look lazy. Well, at my age I look out towards the deathbed and I feel those "things" are unimportant.

Similarly, my son may look lazy. In contrast at age 13 I was more motivated, more ambitious than him.

-- new or update post on blog titles
I like titles with a power phrase or a sharp(ideally short) question. 
These blogposts follow the news journalist tradition, and tries to analyze the given topic from various angles.

These titles are one solution to the proliferation of blog posts.

== new ## tips on tag/cat naming
-- category naming only
Categories are hierarchical. Some info can be inferred from the parent category and can be omitted.

Category sorting matters, esp. in the listing page, when I pick a category from the dropdown to display.

To "control" sorting, hot categories need two alternative names. For example, an1kang1/wellness would sort to top, while wellness/an1kang1 would sort to bottom.

If a category need to sort to top but lacks a good alternative name, then prefix 0, temporarily.
If a category must sort to bottom but lacks a good alternative name, then prefix x_, permanently.

-- new: desparate: healthy lifestyle
Kenneth.Lew is the first to mention "desperate" in the RTS gym.

Daily stretch is supposed to be essential, but evidence is too weak to change people's behavior. 
I wonder what convincing evidence would provide sufficient absorbency for daily 1m practice.
I wonder what convincing evidence would provide sufficient absorbency for daily 30m practice.

workout 5 days a week is the recommendation, but 90% of adults can't find the absorbency/time.

Daily flossing is recommended but I won't do it until my teeth give me big big problems.

Frequent refresh is important to my son's academic studies, but he doesn't recognize it.

-- new: chin-up
A realistic goal would be one a day, but such a goal doens't generate positive feedback. 
I remember my yoga goal was one minute a day. I managed to change my perception to feel good about it.

For chin-up, I need the same change of perception.

retraining chin-up (and stretch) is dreadful but not push-up or cardio

My self-talk matters. My self-talk reflects my perception of reality. This perception affects my actions.

I guess my target for chin-up is too high. I typically aim at 10 chin-up or 40 push-up in a session. 

I think the start-up is harder for chin-up. 5 chin-up = 20 push-up.
