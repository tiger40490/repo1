--update the 7 requirements of late binding in c++
the virtual function's call site is NOT inside a ctor/dtor

-- new: multiset, multimap
In multimap, one key maps to a bag of payloads. As in any map containers, the payloads can be duplicates. In the multimap context, the group of payloads for key1 can also be duplicates.

I think a reasonable implementation is {keyObject -> list of payloads}

In multiset, multiple distinct payload objects can appear equivalent. They could differ by non-essential attributes like creationTime. 

Some people assume multiset can be represented as {keyObject -> count}, but such a container can't hold two equivalent-yet-distinct keyObjects. When I iterate the multiset, I want to see the distinct creationTime values, so all the indivisual payload objects must be saved.

I think a reasonable implementation is treeSet{list{payloads}}.

-- update: https://btv-gz.dreamhosters.com/2009/12/11/pureconcrete-virtual-functions/
Pure virtual dtor is one standard idiom to ensure the host class B is abstract. To use this class you must instantiate a subclass D.
[[moving from c to c++]] P404
A body of this dtor is still required at runtime when a D instance is destructed, so you must provide a definition for ~B() but keep this dtor pure virtual. 

Q: How is such a concrete pure virtual different from a concrete virtual? 
A: subclass D inherits a pure virtual dtor and must concretize it to become a concrete class.

-- update blogpost on college ranking https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/2020/09/21/university-rankings-hkindia/
Many familiar college names have an informal reputation among a small circle of my friends, sometimes just one guy.
The published ranking often challenges those informal and vague, often biased impressions. One concrete example is Princeton. A close friend wrote that "Princeton 本科是第一（USNews)，进入非常困难." I replied 

QS ranking -- https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/princeton-university is latest ranking, showing Princeton at #20
THE ranking -- https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/princeton-university shows Princeton  at #9
Good to recognize that not everyone thinks Princeton is the #1 best college. 

-- new: UChicago drop-out risk 
When I started at UChicago, what's the probability of drop-out like Shou.Liu, Henry.Yang and Chris.Ma? More than 30%

So the long journey demanded a lot of effort, commitment, perseverance ..

I needed a reason to continue. In hindsight, the branding is now fairly valuable in terms of self-image. 

-- new or fuxi: Why ibanks "support" bccy
Ibank's advertized business model is client facilitation. 
Ibanks may hold an inventory of popular bccy, and may also accept service fee payment in bccy. In such a scenario, the ibank would trade bccy for its own position, even though the claim to trade bccy only for hedging. 

In other words, ibanks are dealers rather than pure-play brokers.

Prop trading is a secret business model of ibanks.

--new: G9 SMS to break away from mainstream brainwash

* My wife always feels I look too thin for my health and appearance. I remind myself "I trust my BMI analysis -- Based on years of self-monitoring, My BMI goal is well-founded. Many in my cohort would probably get better healthy longevity if they adopt similar BIM goals."

Most of the other SMS messages are related to middle-class aspirations

* Many of my peers seem to suggest my family deserves higher BR. I focus on livelihood and believe a BR equal to 80% of local median income is reasonable and adequate. By that standard, many of my peers spend way too much. 
* branded college .. Can I accept if my kids only get into community college or polytechnic? This mainstream brainwash is still hitting me hard 
* home size
* car ownership .. In the U.S., and even in SG, my peers take up car ownership for convenience, not livelihood. 
* career longevity is more important than salary; healthy longevity is more important than financial security

-- new: scale-out favored by tech propaganda
The propaganda and the simplistic view favors scale-out. However, scale-out can underperform.

similarly, multithreaded qsort can be slower than single-threaded. 

The original paper on COST (Configuration that Outperforms a Single Thread) asserts that 
The unoptimized implementation "scales" far better, despite (or rather, because of) its inferior instance performance. 

The COST of a given platform for a given problem is the count of cpu cores required before the platform outperforms an optimized single-threaded implementation.

The COST can be hundreds of cores. That many cores may be required by a given scale-out platform to beat a single-threaded implmenetation. If you grow an army of tadpoles against a whale in a tug-of-war, you need an army of millions.

--update zero sum game
bccy and gold are zero sum games by definition since there's no income generated. 
However, gold is natural inflation-hedge. Since our accounting currency is a fiat currency, gold is hopefully better than a zero-sum game, only over the long-term.

-- new life chances in each country.
Now I feel those in Taiwan get fewer life chances due to the stagnant economy. After finishing education, many go to mainland for more life chances. In Taiwan, even if you are reasonably smart and hardworking, the chance of earning a U.S. level salary is quite small. Actually, in the last sentence I used an arbitrary criteria.

Since 2019, the Hongkong residents are also experiencing a decline in life chances.

For many years, I have felt varioius SEAsia nationals have better life chances when thy emmigrate to SG, HK, White English-speaking countries [UK, Australia].
