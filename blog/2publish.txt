coding drill is the most interesting case study. Other people may complete more problems, but i probably spend more time
* Ranked by number of problems, i'm just average
* ranked by hours spent, I'm much higher

--new: old timers trapped ] pressure-cooker #Davis

I think the boss wants to let him go but may feel merciful, so they keep him but give him shitty tasks and demand fast turnaround at good quality.... unreasonable/unfair workload.

A small number of old timers change job but some regret as new job turns out worse. 
Other old timers hear those war-stories and prefer the certainty of known pain in the current job. They don't feel confident they can find a better job.

Many older timers can't afford bench time due to low reserve and high burn rate. 
Old timers tend to be very used to stable income. 
Damien of Macq relied on his bonus payout.. 
Davis had no savings at all.

Most older timers won't take on a 6M contract.

Most older timers will never consider a voluntary pay cut

some older timers worry about job loss so much that they work their ass off to keep the job, even if the workload is unreasonable/unfair. I think in GS I was like them .
Some old timers have a wife who completely opposes job change due to potential impact on family.

Q: why XR and I can afford to quit a job, stay home, and find a lower job? 
A: Supportive wife, burn rate, passive income and savings.

--new: contract rate is not benchmarked against FTE
If my contract rate is higher than FTE team members, we explain that it's not comparable as my employer gets a cut and I also pay more taxes and have no benefits like paid leaves.

If my contract rate is lower than FTE team members, then we often say it's due to market rate. Not sure why, but I don't feel inferior. 

This factor becomes crucial in a PIP situation. The FTE victim would get a donut bonus and donut raise, and her base would fall below some very junior team members .. unbearable humiliation. 
No such humiliation on a non-performing contractor even if his rate is below a grad. Nobody cares about the benchmark.
