however strong you are in a dev team, there are tasks to "reveal" your relative weaknesses, unless you are stronger than average on all fronts

eg: An RTS suport manager, a white American, told me a sizeable percentage Americans choose to earn a degree in their 30's. (My NUS class age profile is not too different, with up to 10% in the late 20's.)
This route is similar to the very common "returning" Master's student who have worked for a few years to gain some firsthand experience of the working world. 
In my MSFM, about 30% of the students were experienced.
I think these "older" students often come in with higher motivation, rather than forced to study as my son is now. 

Not every student is suitable for a nonstop flight secondary->preU->undergrad->Master's 

* If I lose this nice job then emmigration would be the default route. 
* If boy does poorly in secondary school he would not attend poly or JC but serve NS first (I could then work in U.S. alone). 
* If he finds motivation before 16, then we can choose to emmigrate or complete JC.
