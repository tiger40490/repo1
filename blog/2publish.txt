CSY described the reaction of his 3 India-born contractors when manager anounced in a meeting the termination of their project. Project funding would end very soon.
Mgr promised to try and find other teams, but it's unlikely to have all 3 contractors retained.
CSY felt so much luckier because as perm he would have a job in other projects in the same team.

Therefore, he felt he would consider contract only if salary is 50% higher. Underlying reason -- his age and job search challenges are real. Dev-till-70 is not so easy.

This type of observation/experience reinforces the job insecurity "smell" of the contract career.

-- fuxi: precedence: NOT > AND > OR
Proposition 1: Dinosaur existed
Proposition 2: speed kills or "Children lie"

Not P1 AND Not P2 means (Not P1) and (Not P2), with or without the parentheses.

Same in any language.

--new: gap mgmt in FIX^RTS
Multicast is lossy. Very easy to notice a gap. Receivers like RTS should not immediately request retransmission. Instead, they should exercise discretion and patience.

FIX models a continous file. Any gap in seq# is unacceptable, and must be addressed before processing any unexpected high seq#.

--new: 5GHz ^ 2.4GHz wifi
Range favors lower frequency. Bigger homes may need it.

bandwidth/speed favors higher frequency. Video streaming.

Overcrowding in 2.4 can cause intermittent connectivity issues, but is it 5% of the time or 0.05% of the time? Not sure. In contrast, Microwave oven did hit me 95% of the time.
