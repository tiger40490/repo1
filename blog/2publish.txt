-- update the blogpost on 5 tsn domains, perhaps 
https://btv-gz.dreamhosters.com/2021/04/07/compare-4-tsn-domains/

Now I recall that for years I was attracted to algo trading, automated trading, any trading decision using some math as it sounds cool.

Now I think this domain is still relatively well-paid, but doesn't generate high profit as before.

The complexity has not reduced. The field still needs people, but I feel it is losing the talent game against the newer domains like web2.0, DS/ML, crypto

-- update .. 
(updating an existing blogpost will take longer)
Through my late 40's to 50, in which technial domain will I maintain my competitive high ground?

core Java language? Remarkably stable
xLang concurrency
xLang dStruct
perl? Unfortunately perl6 has moved
drv pricing + bond math [Type1 dnlg] ? Yes because programmers don't study the math
byte-level parsing
WallSt architecture [Type3 dnlg]

-- new: Dram refresh: localSys^criticalMass^CIV
c++ > java because my java critical mass is easier, more self-sustaining
localSys? 
coding drill? Not so fast "decay", but harder to refresh

-- slow-cooking update post on XH.Fu.
Free agents like XH probably value the freedom very high. I once valued my freedom too, and didn't mind earning $2k/M, but when I started dating and planning for family, I realized I was left way behind by my cohort.

The freedom became .. not that valuable.

Nowadays, some of my recent jobs offer very high freedom, comparable to my free-agent lifestyle.

-- update blogpost on the limitations of bccy
bitcoin is supposed to remove the central authority, replaced with the consensus mechanism. However, the software is still controlled by an elite group of programmers. There's always some governance in any open source codebase.

-- new: inflation: econ/fin texbooks
P71 [[Intl Fin]]
P637 [[[Mishkin]]] i.e. [[Economics of money, banking and fin markets]]

-- update mag:
sometimes I get into a low mood and carry a negative perception about many of my books, so even a big home library may be insufficient. The gen magazine is an alternative.

-- update blogpost on mkt depth
runners, painters .. have the worst mkt depth. Only the national top runners can earn endorsement fees or receive government support.

Buy Hey, I don't need more money, more brank, more status, more clout.

His son grows up in a broken family. That's a real pain.
