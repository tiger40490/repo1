--new: which of my qualities do I want to see in my son
Kyle asked "what do you want your son to grow up like?" I said I want him to be good at something, not competitively per se.

Kyle pointed out I'm good at tech stuff (I would say not competitively.) I would say I'm good at pushing myself on diet, regular exercise, study. 
Am also good at lifelong study, like my dad. 
Am also good at conserver lifestyle and cash-flow management.

Any of these are positive qualities I want to see in my son.
