--update forgetful trips
avoid unnecessary checking on phone, wallet, laptop etc when outside home/office. Probability of "accident" is slight worse when outside due to distraction, but cost of accident is significantly worse.

For 0.txt printout, accident is less likely as it is in a low-risk pocket.

-- update SWE https://btv-gz.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=42441&action=edit
In U.S. and increasing in SG, the traditional doctor/architect professions are now comparable to SWE profession.
However, a key difference is accu [including tech churn]. 

Many high-earning SWE must learn new tech 30 years into their career.
Some of these SWEs don't mind learning new tech or even enjoy learning new tech...

The WallSt coreJava contractor profession is a rare exception in terms of tech churn. 
This profession resembles the medical profession even better, if you throw in cpp, shell scripting, SQL, FIX, bondMath and other evergreen tech skills.
This description is probably biased, but I am hopeful and optmistic.

-- update post on AMB "action"
blogg, reviewing, discussing with friends ... is also action.

-- update CIV skills https://btv-gz.dreamhosters.com/2018/07/02/ect-bp-drill-has-lasting-value-to-family-well-being/ 
All the skills required for CIV [BP, syntax..] are just like QQ -- never required at work.

So 10Y professional project experience won't improve your CIV performance. An undergrad can outperform you given enough practice.
