--new: y smart ptr popular in c++IV
I think even if a hiring team doesn't use smart ptr (for that matter, TMP, threading,,), they would drill into this topic as it is a good probe on big4

--new: throw: always explicit in c++
t_clarify
in java, a Throwable object can come from some invisible code, perhaps in the jvm implementation code.

In c++ a catch clause always catches something explicitly thrown by a c++ code module, almost never something from a C library. 

However, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28925878/do-c-standard-library-functions-which-are-included-in-c-throw-exception shows some corner case of undefined behavior in a strcpy(). In such a case, the c++ compiler can do anything such as throwing exception.

Note C functions like strcpy() doesn't throw because C doesn't support exceptions, but c++ compiler is permitted to and does generate throwing code in some corner cases.

I guess the ERE author can say he is living his life to the fullest. I don't need to benchmark with him. Similar to him, or unlike him, I do feel I'm living my life to the fullest. There's nothing missing in my current carefree life. My current life is satisfying and complete.

The Bhuddist would say there's still a lot of unsatisfied desires and pains lurking beneath the surface. Admittedly, the pains will surface, but they become mild and forgotten. 

The current condition is obviously impermanent, and possibly short-lived, but in this blogpost I don't care.

The red cornerstones are based on cashflow.
