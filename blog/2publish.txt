--update on age-50: how much contingency cash to hold
200k might be too much 
Wife wants more cash as buffer. So how about $50k liquid cash in my accounts?

--new: involuntary celibacy and sexual needs
Involuntary or semi-voluntary celibacy happens in army, rehab, frontier mining camps and imgrant worker dorms. 
For years until 2005 when I decided to reboot my dating "mission", I brainwashed myself, systematically for years, to believe that "my current life is complete without a sexual relationship".

Once a few months, I would get a rude awakening as I come across sexy images of respectable (not lower-class) women, and I confront the reality that I had a deep and vast but unfulfilled need systematically suppressed for years.

It is comparable to the need to have kids, desire for a healthy BMI, desire (of Chinese villagers) for a reputable degree, need for long-term financial security...

Inevitably, I would find myself struggling to /dodge/ the question "Is my current life really complete?" Sometimes it felt like a gaping hole covered with paper in my "complete" life.

I guess a sex worker would have met my needs to some extent. Some would say the sexual need I experienced was mostly biological, but a psychologist may point out the fundamental and powerful emotional undercurrents in human sexual relations. Humans are much more than animals in their sexual relations.

--update good life
Walking on the street and looking at well-dressed women ... 

jogging near waterfront
yoga
piano

These are typical "indulgences" for women, and hobbies for some men, but for me these efforts require absorbency. They provide me more than "simple good life".... they make me feel privileged.

Spending time in self-care, self-enhancement is kinda important to my experience of "good life".
