Hi Jay,

A current colleague of mine is a Chinese Canadian. He has a Canadian company. He would like to use his company for corp-to-corp billing, as alternative to W2 billing.

Possible?

Q: given a backyard, what usages do I find valuable?

swimming? too small
basketball? no fun

Many of these usages require expensive set-up, not worth it if used lightly
