t_gold
As discussed in ... most top school district homes have underwhelming rental yield, because you can't subdivide them into smaller private units. These homes cost a lot partly due to psf premium in a premium location, but more becuase of size. They are white elephants with higher taxes, high maintenance costs. In contrast, commercial and prime-location residential properties are both prestigious and high-yield.

Grand piano is another white elephant. I always prefer simple, functional alternatives.

Jewelry is a white elephant. Poor liquidity, low inheritance value, but Gold is a less white elephant. A kilobar sounds prestigious but you have to pay some security firm to hold it for you.  One advantage of gold coin collection (not kilobar) is that you can buy or sell a small portion of it. Fairly liquid except the lousy bid/ask spread.

--some notes from the informal mid-year review
* flexibility while testing with global brokers
* learn more varieties of EPA's, esp. on the dnlg
* higher productivity, faster delivery
* be more vocal during team meetings, but it's easy to put someone else on the spot
* PMA bug fix 

--Hi Dr Lau,
Two new topics to discuss in Lihui's review.

1) breast implants
Am a bit concerned, perhaps more than needed. I want to know a lot of details on their current conditions, so as to help nudge her to do the right thing for herself, including more frequent mammograms than once a decade:)

My wife never let me know any details. I will try to give her the privacy she wants. If she doesn't want to discuss in my presence, then I will wait outside until you finish this discussion.

2) frequency of intimacy
My wife is embarrassed about this topic. I hope she will not stop me asking you questions.

Basically, I believe that intimacy between husband and wife is good for reproductive organs and heart, among other body functions. Reproductive organs could give life-threatening problems, right? So we need to take care of them.

Given my and Lihuis age and health conditions, I think we should maintain, not decrease, our frequency, right?

----
There are also two old topics -- my wife thinks I'm too thin too yellowish to be healthy, for my age. I need your help to correct her mis-perception in the review session. This is one rare opportunity to have an open, hopefully in-depth, discussion. This discussion is (almost) as important as Lihui's own health.

However, she is not alwyas articulate about her concerns. She is a woman of few words. You would need to listen very carefully to her few words and try to understand her concerns. I will take the lead to describe (my view of) her concerns. To save valuable face time, i will describe here.

Her concern is basically based on nothing but personal biases, rumor and superstitions (which also influence my own opinions but I read more literature, with a healthy dose of skeptism). 

She knows she should lose weight (either for health or for appearance), but she somehow thinks I should NOT lose weight or look more yellowish. I think she's comparing me with so-called male role models, perhaps among her family members, her friends' husbands/boyfriends, and (hold your breath) a lot of entertainment professionals. She never mentions any athlete, who tend to look too slim to be her.

So I often tell her that more than half of those role models in my age group are less healthy than me, in terms of BMI and diet. Among my generation in developed countries (and China), very few would end up with malnutrition, but 99% of us would develop long-term health conditions due to over-consumption of various nutritions including alcohol. Over consumption affect heart, liver, kidney, bones, BMI and hamper individuals' abilities to lead a more active life.

--new: what2give my kids: the Most valuable 
My healthy long life and my presence throughout their adult lives? This is what I value most in my dad.

Lifelong habits? I think this is overvalued. Lifelong habits are not easily transferred across generations. It demands effort on my part and on their part.

Education beyond certificates? I think this is overvalued. Education is 70% achieved by themselves and perhaps 20% by parenting and 10% environmental.

financial inheritance? Very tangible benefit. This benefit is very much enhanced if thanks to longevity I am available to "administer" it.

-- update: next HDB home: 
buy first (am picky on the buy)
This will save us the trouble of moving twice.

Possibility of renting out some extra rooms.
