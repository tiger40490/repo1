--new: writing to map 
put_If_Absent: java uses putIfAbsent(); c++ uses insert()
insert_Or_Update (most common map "Writing"): java uses put(); c++ uses operator[]. 
update_If_Existing: c++ needs if-block; java uses replace() which returns null if nothing replaced; 

Note computeIfAbsent() is kinda more efficient than putIfAbsent which unconditionally computes the new "value" even though there's a 50/50 chance it is unneeded -- i.e. the incumbent scenario.

--new: data center ^ cloud@@

Q: does data center rack space always mean some form of cloud?

Q: if not, then what's the difference between a regular data center and a cloud?

Two major sectors:
* financial companies -- generally use private data centers, probably not cloud. The grid/farm could offer elasticity i.e. compute nodes enlisted on demand, but I don't know if (docker) containers are created on the fly.
* web sites -- often uses the cloud, but not necessarily the elastic cloud

The other sectors are unfamiliar to me.

So whenever I hear people talk about cloud or grid, I would enquire about container
