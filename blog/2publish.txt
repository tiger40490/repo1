-- new: 功能老化: which2protect
As we age, some "system functions" will decline faser than other functions. Which ones are the most important to protect?

~~ Half Ranked: 
BMI
muscle strength (esp. upperbody) + endurance
bone strength
CRE .. many elderly can maintain CRE through swim, hiking, jogging
short-term memory, 
sexual health without aid
appetite .. consider grandpa
eyesight, hearing

Note lower-ranked items are often high-value but too hard (or too easy) to preserve. No perfect example, but I will say sexual.

-- new: yoga: maintain^improve #Steve
slowdown of decline is the real goal. Steve also felt similarly.

improvemenet is rarely a valid goal. Positive feedback is rare.
One type of visible improvement is "endurance" in a tough pose.

Steve spoke some truths that other instructors couldn't
* sugg: hold longer, like yin yoga, and rest in the pose.
* sugg: need to relax much, much more. If you are tense, then the muscle can't stretch 

The pain in the affected body part ... is part of the process. It would improve over time. Should not be uncomfortable at the whole-person level meaning you must be able to relax with the pain. It's possible.

I guess there's a harmony between the pain and the relaxation.

-- new TPY condo rent
1BR: 3k
2BR: 3.5k

Reliable data from my MLP colleague.
In the same month, Gary also said "hard to find anything below 3k HDB"

in 2019, across SG, unshared 1BR condo was $2k+

-- new: some BTO locations we could accept
Bedok central -- closer to ChBP
Bishan, AMK
CCK .. familiar rural location and LRT hub
Bukit Batok .. close to JEast

TPY will maintain a location advantage as the northern parts improve.

-- update bpost on 4% inflation
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/inflation-taxes-rising-costs-living-supply-chains-singapore-budget-2022-2492451

CPI reached 4% in 2021. 

The authors claimed that "Inflation has been high chiefly because of the unprecedented stimulus from fiscal and monetary policies worldwide"

The authors characterized the current situation as "a large amount of cash and a small supply of goods"... referring to QE and supply-chain disruptions during the pandemic.

The chief author is a Chicago-Fed economist and professor, educated in the US.

single-category doctrine?

Q: how many tags would be too many in a big blog?
A: 300. Too many would slow down auto-sugestion when I am in a hurry

For tags, overlap is a bigger problem than proliferation, so lots of fuxi* or upto* tags are not so bad.

--new: fuxi entries in git-blogg
the "fuxi" entry in git blogg is a crucial feature. Before this invention, I had to decide how to handle such content. 
The content is not worthless to be deleted, but publishing it would lead to either too many low-value bposts, or too much legwork updating existing bposts. 
There's already too much content and insufficient consolidation.

Therefore, the growing "fuxi" content is a necessary evil, and something of an asset.

-- update bpost on nuts
Even though many studies find regular nut-eaters are leaner and more heart-healthy than non-eaters, the nuts won't have a net benefit if we fail to follow the strict guideline

* if you eat X grams of nuts, you must compensate by cutting Y grams of saturated fats
* you must avoid coating with sugar, salt, oil etc, as they could "cancel out" the heart-healthy benefits of nuts !
* you must moderate nuts intake, and avoid binge.

-- update: tiny improvement
my reading/blogg topic is now less introvertive, more extrovertive, more about the society. A good trend, though the reverse is nothing negative.

However, news reading is time consuming, and not as rewarding/fulfilling as my recreational xx.

-- update bpost on cancer
Medical literature often mention short-term stress, like fight-or-flight

short term stress is not so harmful. Chronic stress is.

-- new: longRest->tempRecovery in laptops
Periodically, we had better bring out each laptop (also spectacles) to use for a while. This sentence is vague until I point out 1) oxidation and 2) longRest->recovery.

More than one laptop has shown "longRest->recovery".
I had to power down for many days to get a few hours (or longer) recovery from a defect.

This pattern has many implications.

A slighly defective laptop (eg: A299) can be used in place of a new laptop to prolong the latter's shelf life.

Q: to match an hour of jogging, during quarantine we would need to step up/down on a platform, skip rope or squat, but for how long, and how often can you put up with it? 

The absorbency required is too high ! Sugar coating is crucial, not optional in the form of jogging path

-- new: visible fitness corners
At GardensByTheBay fitness corner and TPY stadium, I enjoy more absorbency against boring strength training. 

Fort Caning fitness corner is so-so.

In all other fitness corners like downstairs, I feel poor absorbency.

I think key is visibility to the onlookers. 

Some gyms put workout equipments right beside a big window, so gym users are easily visible from the busy street outside. Visibility can serve as a potent motivation.

-- new open blog: inflation n wage
theoretical
bold
see also https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/549/inflation-in-singapore-personal-xp/

Many economic theories assume that for a particular household, high inflation can be offset by higher wages. This sweeping, simplistic assumption has many weaknesses

* during high inflation, many households have no working member .. unemployed, retired,,,
* during high inflation, many (more than we think) sectors do not experience higher profit, and are unable to increase wages beyond a token increment
* during high inflation, many wage earners have no bargaining power at all.

How about intRate? Does it grow with inflation? I have lived through many eras to question this broad assumption.

-- update glamorous woman
Lin Chi-ling
Teresa Teng
Charlie Yeung
Zoe Tay
Gigi Leung

These glamorous women each chose a man "lower" in wealth and economic power. In a way, such a glamorous woman has made enough money and doesn't need more money. She does need equality in marriage. Having higher economic power provides her a safety.

Once they commit to a marriage, they become extremely vulnerable. They would have a marriage to protect. They may have kids to protect. Statistically, marriage failure within her circle was higher than average, perhaps 30%. 

The power, wealth, good looks.. on the opposite side is a hazard.

In fact, many of them didn't marry someone older, because an older man attracted to a young glamorous woman can easily get seduced by an even younger woman

Therefore, these glamorous women were shrewd. They know their priority, their weaknesses/vulnerabilities, their liabilities (累赘).

-- new: speak slowly when..
when speaking to someone new
when speaking on the phone rather than face to face
when spaking about something sensitive or important
when nervous.
when in front of many people

.. no one speaks too slowly. Most peopel including me speak too fast.

If you have a tendency to stutter, then slow speaking can reduce it. If not eliminated, then slow speaking with stutter is a kind of unique personal style. It's not perfect but it can be disarming and earn you trust.

I heard a departing colleague's truthful reflections including the reasons for the departure. One of the reasons is related to comp benchmark. I guess (with good level of confidence) that he feels that given his value-add and effort, he should receive $XX more (whatever XX is).

The more one dwells on it, the more one would feel unfair -- Someone else in the same team has the same level of value-add but was rewarded much more.

It's a valuable protection that I don't put in extra effort and sacrifice for the manager. It protects me from the hazard of harmful comparision. If you don't compare, you feel satisfied. If you do, your bubble bursts and derails.

At my age, I don't salary-benchmark as much as in my 30s -- I don't care so much about wasting my potential, my spare capacity. It's good and bad. 

It's bad if I am chronically underpaid (20% below market) like J.Zhang.
It's good if my employer and my manager is generous and keen to retain older SWEs like me.

-- new: marriage counseling: deep conversations, shared activity
Shared activity ... I can't think of any (besides our weekly family outings). I try to join her on her solo trips to the nearby supermarket. At best it is a 20-minute activity. Her hobbies include watching Korean dramas, online shopping, and visiting department stores,... but I don't share those hobbies.

You mentioned regular deep conversation and quality time. Indeed our bonding has improved because we now have many quiet mornings on weekdays when kids are in school and I work the afternoon shift. Quiet mornings are precious and probably unsustainable because my wife is planning to get a regular job. Outside these quiet mornings, I don't recall any quality time. Our conversations are never really deep, but when we were alone together long enough (during quiet mornings), we have the opportunity to talk about non-trivial topics at length. Other people can't imagine how hard it is for my wife to sustain a focused conversation beyond 10 minutes. On any topic, she would quickly come to a conclusion and have no patience to hear my words. 

Suppose the topic is our new home. She could sustain only a 15-min chat on the "Renovation" topic (close to her heart). However, if there are several sub-topics like 1) shower-screen 2)flooring 3)timeline 4)risk management 5)budget... then she can sustain a 5-minute chat on each sub-topic.  In fact, "risk" and "budget" are vague topics for her. She has problems going in-depth on these abstract topics. She can sustain longer conversations on the "wall tile" topic.

Another example of a concrete topic is a vacation to, say, Bali. 
Another example of a vague, broad topic is how to help kids with academics (in her mind, that means nothing but grades).
Another example of a vague, broad topic is how to improve communications between the 2 of us.

These examples (except the "communications" topic) are some of the rather few topics of interest to her. In contrast, 90% of my favorite conversation topics (shared with my friends) are too boring to her, too abstract, too technical, too big. Though she has a diploma, her intellectual curiosity is like a high school girl. It is reflected in her conversation topics. I didn't mention that she is interested in K-pop, shopping, make-up, and fashion for kids, but I have zero interest therein.

I said in our first chat that "meaningful conversations" is a visible weakness in this marriage. I have been disappointed too many times so I have given up on it. However, the depth of conversations (or lack thereof) in my marriage is not a serious problem. 

A chatting partner is a different relationship altogether. I often have chatting partners at work or among ex-colleagues/ex-classmates. I feel intimate enough to share lots of personal thoughts, but we don't depend on each other for livelihood.

In contrast, there are important relationships that are not built on in-depth conversations. For example, a relationship between 2 joint owners of a business, or relationship between two siblings, or relationship between a boss and her only worker (in a team of two) can all be functional, supportive, and effective despite a lack of in-depth conversations. 

I agree with you that a majority of successful, fulfilling marriages feature the chatting-partner relationship, but believe it's not a make-or-break feature.
