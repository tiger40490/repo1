--new: avocado
better than most cooked fatty foods and animal fats
Compared to fatty fish? Not sure
Compared to nuts? not sure
Best way to eat avocado: smoothie with chia
As I said in 2018, we should limit ourselves to half an avocado a day, to limit the fat intake

Published calorie numbers might be higher than the fattening effects on my system as an individual.

--new: 4 types of carbs
re the blogpost on resistant starch

I think the western weight-loss industry targets all forms of carbs almost indiscriminately. Many commentators exclude fiber. Some exclude fruit sugar. My view is kinda mainstream in my focus on table sugar and starch.

* table sugar and derivatives are universally condemned and should be taken in moderation. Table sugar can affect heart and diabetes.
* fruit sugar -- is widely considered similar to table sugar but I seriously doubt it. No evidence suggests fruit sugar cause weight gain. In my case, when I eat lots of sweet fruits, my weight doesn't increase.
* starch -- I find it quite fattening, but I believe the calorie density is below half of fat. Most people tend to eat many many grams of starch so it is probably responsible for weight gain.
* dietary fiber -- there's plenty of research showing these carbs are not absorbed, but still most calorie numbers treat it same as table sugar !

--new jolt: what calorie-dense foods are binge-risky
Note water content is arguably the biggest unsung hero having the potential to save the day. 
Many otherwise binge-risky calorie-dense foods are saved by the high water content -- fruits, smoothie, chendol, red-bean congee, even ice cream (with chia seed),,, The more water content, the safer, since the stomach gets filled up by the water content which serves as a binge-preventing circuit-breaker.

nuts -- prime eg. I can binge i.e. eat a lot quickly. Some people are naturally unable to.
starch -- I can eat a lot in one meal, including the fibrous starch like starchy roots.
lean meat -- (not KFC)
:) fish -- (non-fried) I can eat quite a lot but fish is almost always low-fat, low-starch so I get filled up without too much calorie load.
:) whole fruits -- most of us can't eat too much fruits (with the sugar), largely thanks to the water content
creamy cakes, fried foods, chicken skin, potato salad -- are the worst fatty foods. High binge risk.
:) chocolate? I usually don't binge, not at the same level as cakes or potato salad. 
:) avocado?? not sure. Not as tasty as cheese cakes and more natural and more fibrous. Also quite expensive, and seldom offered in quantity.

--new: Every now and then, I feel resentful for my wife's (and to a lesser extent my mother's) remarks that she thinks I look unhealthy.

I work very hard to reduce my calorie intake but her words  weaken the precious resolve I have built for my diet. 

I feel her words have the potential to derail my entire effort.

I feel scared -- Once I lose this precious resolve, I would put on, say, 5kg and hate myself (and her). What scares me most is my bitter hatred. 

The frustration doesn't help my effort, but is there a way to turn her words into a positive force? Sometimes I want to demonstrate to my wife that I'm better than those individuals she considers healthier, but I am afraid of setting myself a target that creates more self-hate.

The control and responsibility belongs to me. I take full ownership. However, I feel vulnerable, weak and unstable, so much so that I notice a tendency to blame the environment and other people. I have practiced this blame game for years.

I wish I was stronger, able to withstand the adversities hitting me from every direction.

..reflection after the chat with Bindi
trust that you have the resolve and the strength to restore your current weight after a 5kg relapse. I have the image of the aging Batman.

I tend to feel the current extraordinary BMI level is a blessing, not effort. In the cool light of day, I see it's at least 70% by my effort.

Q: what if my wife says that again? Am scared.
A: try to stay calm and tell her that her words aren't helping. Then swiftly disengage. Ideally leave the scene. Am so lucky that office is steps away

--update blogpost on best starch
grandma said some raw grains are more fibrous, but to me, all grains are starchy except chia seed

Starch means addictive, wrong-quantity temptation, and heavy impact on weight.

I still prefer green peas and beans for the lower starch density

--update blogpost on ice cream
somehow, I feel ice cream is lighter than the addictive starchy foods in Singapore.

This feeling is contradicting published calorie density.

I think ice cream has lots of water so calorie density is significantly lower. Some say one cup of ice cream is too small for most people, but if we remove the water, one cup would shrink to half a cup.

--new: 50/50: slimming solutions
the slimming industry greatly underestimate/understate the variance among individuals. 

My acid test of a success/failure would be something like losing 10 pounds (or 5 kg) and keeping it off for 3M. Just about every weight loss product has a roughly 50/50 chance of success on an individual. 

--new: fried^buttery foods 
fried food is more harmful than buttery cakes, but somehow less addictive!

I seldom get to choose between them, but if I must choose one, I would choose buttery.

--update blogpost on long^short horizon
Long-horizon prospect is fundamentally connected to current pains such as time mgmt, mtv,,, Accepting the former should help me accept the latter.

The more completely I accept the former, the more it would help me coping with the current pains.

--new: exam:#1strategic subject #M^C
Chinese -- because in the U.S. there's no environment.

English? No. he may grow up an untrained writer but he will be proficient in English as an everyday language. Grammar, vocab will be fine.

Math -- he needs foundation skills. I feel his foundation is sound so far, though his don't-care attitude is indistinguishable from a weak foundation.

--new jolt: time spent blogg`about boy=therapeutic
Time spend blogging about boy is therapeutic. 

Also, the time spent preparing his math worksheet is therapeutic -- a landed punch; am able to focus, calm down and make (albeit slow) progress; gaining traction rather than wheel-spinning

I'm good at these even though they take up huge amount of energy and precious quiet time.
Luckily I don't feel worn out by these efforts.

I feel at my age, parenting IS a main job, comparable to my day job. 
Actually, Career progression is NOT my main responsibility at this stage of my life.

--new: better blog post titles:
catchy phrases
sharp questions

It requires time and mental energy to create and improve blog titles. 
Effective titles help organize my thoughts on a complex and challenging subject such as parenting or diet. 
Such a subject may grow to 200 blogposts, so without effective organization lots of content become effectively lost.

--new: effective text highlighting in git-blog etc
* most versatile is __connected_underline__
* color, bold, font size, strike-through
* underline -- confusing (hyperlink)
* italics -- hardly noticeable on its own. Need to combine with other highlighting
