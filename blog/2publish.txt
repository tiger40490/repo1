--new: 5GHz ^ 2.4GHz wifi
Range favors lower frequency. Bigger homes may need it.

bandwidth/speed favors higher frequency. Video streaming.

Overcrowding in 2.4 can cause intermittent connectivity issues, but is it 5% of the time or 0.05% of the time? Not sure. In contrast, Microwave oven did hit me 95% of the time.

-- new English:
carless, car-free, 

-- new: grown-up child
"Child" has two distinct meanins 1) underaged 2) son/daughter OF something

What if you want to refer to 2) exactly?

In conversations, you need OF/my/our/ etc to eliminate 1). If the context doesn't offer that opportunity, then you need to say "grown-up child" or "adult child"

"kids" .. no good
"offspring" .. no good

-- New English: Don't get me started about ...
I do not feel that the convenience of owning a car compensated for all of the other inconveniences it provided like parking and having to maneuver it in bad weather. I live on a hill. Donâ€™t get me started about trying to get up and down the hill in the winter.

-- new: midlife crisis #RoyalSociety
"Now in my 40s I have not achieved much (i.e. my targets)" is a rude awakening for many middle-aged men.

Those specific-n-measurable targets we were instructed to formulate are a double-edged sword. 
They often sow the seed for the midlife crisis and self-hate.

Those targets serve to focus our laser energy, but also sharpens the focus on our so-called failures. 

If you write down the specific targets, there are many variations of them in career, parenting, financial etc. A measurable target like "$500k-by40" would become uninspiring when most of your peers exceed that target much earlier. So the real target in our subconscious might be exclub-related.

Among the major targets, many parents would include "academic kids" but I can be a successful parent if my kids grow up to live a healthy, happy, fulfilled but mediocre life without academic or professinoal success. Actually, most parents' lives are really mediocre, including mine. Not raising academic kids is not a failure and should not contribute to midlife crisis.

Achieve, Perform, Success, Pride, (self-)respect .. are all pegged to the exclub, FOLB and self-hate.

"There exists a socially prescribed timetable for the ordering of major life events: a time in the life-span when men and women are expected to marry, a time to raise children, a time to retire" -- Bernice Neugarten. An individdual (me included) would often recognize in hindsight that this prescribed timetable is not suitable or ideal for herself. Individual differences are bigger than expected. We don't all fit the same mould.

As I told grandpa, we tend to notice that among the "visible success stories", the biggest age group is 40-50, bigger than 50-60. This is such a statistical misperception:

* many of these "visible success" individuals suffer ill-health(work-life imbalance, hazardous stress..), poor career longevity, job insecurity, financial ill-health (Brbr, debt..)
* many of these "visible success" individuals would fall out of the leading pack later in life

I think rather few professional men have wellness, stable/resilient marriage as a top 3 target... wrong priority.

-- new: USD 100k warchest for rental relief
t_jolt

This amount means a lot to rental home comfort [size..]. $1k/M additional rental will exhaust this amount in 8 years !
This amount is insignificant for branded colleges .. not worthwhile
This amount is insignificant for a SDXQ home .. not worthwhile
This amount is easy to squirrel away, esp. in SG
To relieve work stress, I can realistic consider giving up $30k/Y salary over 10Y. USD 300k lost_pretax_income is no big deal. (After-tax, it would become a 200 lost income.)
This amount as a target bonus, is brutal and unforgiving. I won't accept such a target. I will reject such a target.
