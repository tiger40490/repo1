-- update blogpost on stock picking distractions
I once spent tons of hours on FSM cherry-picking but underwhelming ROTI

Stock picking analysis? I did that for a while on Robinhood. Not impressive.

Just reading the newspapers alone would take lots of mental energy

--update blogpost on 12M delay
eg: my sis was delayed by a year+ when transferring from RongCheng to Dongzongbu. Is there any negative/hazardous effect? No but at that time I saw it as a stigma

So in my family, both my sister and I went through a big delay and we both turned out fine.

The stigma on delayed students was a modern China phenomenen. There is some kind of perception (superstition) that if a kid is hitting some academic standard, then the younger she is the stronger is her age-adjusted score and academic potential.

--update : ffree ^ envy+FOMO
Other people's envy is the damper of my bare-bones ffree.
If we don't compare to the (wrong) peer group we can feel pretty comfortable and carefree, in a glowing self-esteem. So why do we compare?

On one hand, minimum acceptable food cost is dropping globally, and I have way more than enough income to survive. 
On the other hand I feel lousy seeing some so-called "peers" earning 10 times more than that minimum.
Each of them seems to complain about cost level.

Q: what's enough? Philip Che said $5k for a family of 4. Wife said 4-5k for my family of 4. See worldbank^wife

I'm confronting the paradox of my adulthood. In pursuit of a rational perception, I have a chance to restore some balance in my world view.

I feel Theordore Rubin's books shed some light. He introduced some good descriptors.
