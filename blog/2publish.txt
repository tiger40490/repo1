--update blogpost on ... blogging 
For a long time I felt confused, powerless , helpless against the challenges coming from the environment, the exam system, fellow parents, my son's resistance, and my own EQ limitations and brain power limitations.

--new: biggest c++dev projects #$5k DBS
In 2015 I toyed with the outlandish idea of applying for a $5k/M DBS job just to get a hardcore big-project c++ dev experience.

The criteria for "big" depends on the specific skills you want to demonstrate or learn.

* If you mean navigation, tracing, build, enhancement, large team BestPractices,,, in a large codebase, then MS is largest, followed by Macq MTS and Macq quant. 

* If you mean substantial source code size that demonstrates data structures, threading,,, then my NYSE integrated feed parser is largest 
followed by my weekend coding interview projects. Mvea is next biggest.

It's worthwhile to review those weekend projects, mostly hosted in cppProj
