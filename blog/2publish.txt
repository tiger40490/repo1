Suppose in a big python application your main script imports a few packages and modules. One of them is mod2.py, which in turn imports mod2a.py. 

You want to add logging/instrumentation to mod2a.py but this file is loaded from a readonly firm-wide repository, common practice in big teams. Here's my technique.

1. copy the file to your home dir and add the logging.
2. now import this modified version. Locate the import in mod2.py
3. copy mod2.py to your home dir and edit the import:

sys.path.insert(0, '/home/dir')
import mod2a
sys.path.remove('/home/dir')

All other imports should be unaffected

4. edit main.py and edit the importation of mod2.py to load it from /home/dir

Some people may rename the modified mod2a.py. This is easier if the importation is
from mod2a import abc

Otherwise, every mention of "mod2a" in mod2.py needs a change
