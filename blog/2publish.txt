-- new (or update): young techie's worries
My income is not rising as much as my cohort
My skillset is not broad enough. I'm boxed in and have a single narrow skillset compared to my cohort.
not learning enough, not competent enough
short runway .. by age 30 I am expected to be competent, independent, possibly a team lead
too many choices
long struggle ahead, over 40Y
"Is this domain right for me? Will I regret?"
peer pressure on all fronts

-- update post on Fenix
Consider JackZ and Raymond's situations. At my age and (my economic) level, what endeavors (spaceshuttle name) are really strategic?
1) wellness lifestyle improvements like yoga, sustainable diet habits, BMI
2) dev-till-70 accu, plowback,,, including QQ and CIV
? academic parenting? No. I prioritize motivation, bonding, coaching 
? prepare for relocation to U.S. including car ownership, burn rate control

--new: % allocate spare time
See also blogpost on Luke Su and spare time accounting
First let me present my pratical (hopefully valuable) quantification of spare time: excluding required work time (+commute), essential family-support time (+repairs), bio-time (sleep, nutrition/preparation)
Second, let's name the G3 non-overlapping allocations excluding the hard-to-estimate unused time. Note Blogging is a "mixin" element.
* 20% pff. Am reducing it from 40%
* 20% parenting including seeking help. Am increasing it from 5%
* 20% workout + wellness research; tech xx including localSys + body-building
* 40% other blogging

If I put in more than 3 items, then I tend to spend too much time fine-tuning the estimates but these estimates are not so useful in hind sight.

--update public ives
In terms of reputation, some of the public ives (Berkeley, ) are comparable to some original ives.
Fees or acceptance rate can be much better.

If brand is not that important to me, then we should favor the public ives.

In terms of acceptance rate, I think UChicago is much tougher than NUS, and more exclusive.

-- update post on Jiang.Zhu
I guess he is more of a tech lead, not a mgr, not a product visionary, not an technopreneur

At his level, he can't slack off and adopt an semi-retired ezlife

-- new: [21] chat with Alina #
The CTO is a workholic, working 10am - 1am. I see wrong priorities in that, esp. viewed at the deathbed. The company, the profit, is not an achievement considered worthwhile in the END.
Those achievements are part of personal "success" only in the exclub sense.

I told Alina my priorities have shifted to wellness [longevity, 5/wk] as I need more money only half-heartedly. I think this is similar to MMM attitude.

How much is "enough money"? Remember the latency discussion, and other blogposts.

Alina shared her experience about renting, and said she really wanted home ownership. I find this sentiment rather deep-rooted. Those young professionals in top China cities seem to be trapped. Residential properties are pushed (by hot money) beyond their reach. Many people probably want to avoid this "game" but they also feel renting is not sustainable not satisfactory.
I feel U.S. culture is different. Many smart Americans (including some middle-class Americans) stay renting long-term by choice.

Taking a step back, I guess my /drive/ towards ctbz/economizing, breakaway, conserver/minimalistic lifestyle, focus on livelihood(not FOFO),,, is hard for many in Alina's cohort. I guess that's why my level of carefree Fuller wealth is possibly beyond their reach(望尘莫及).

-- new: desparate: healthy lifestyle
Kenneth.Lew is the first to mention "desperate" in the RTS gym.

Daily stretch is supposed to be essential, but evidence is too weak to change people's behavior. 
I wonder what convincing evidence would provide sufficient absorbency for daily 1m practice.
I wonder what convincing evidence would provide sufficient absorbency for daily 30m practice.

workout 5 days a week is the recommendation, but 90% of adults can't find the absorbency/time.

Daily flossing is recommended but I won't do it until my teeth give me big big problems.

Frequent refresh is important to my son's academic studies, but he doesn't recognize it.

-- update solitude
Many old men (few women) sitting in bus interchange to avoid loneliness. 
A job would provide better connectedness, though it is a dependency

-- new: chin-up
A realistic goal would be one a day, but such a goal doens't generate positive feedback. 
I remember my yoga goal was one minute a day. I managed to change my perception to feel good about it.

For chin-up, I need the same change of perception.

retraining chin-up (and stretch) is dreadful but not push-up or cardio

My self-talk matters. My self-talk reflects my perception of reality. This perception affects my actions.

I guess my target for chin-up is too high. I typically aim at 10 chin-up or 40 push-up in a session. 

I think the start-up is harder for chin-up. 5 chin-up = 20 push-up.
