-- polish -> new: ##ways@link`blogposts
Linking is essential in all web content, including blogs. 

Linking in my blog is high-value and high-tcost. We need continuous process improvement. There are currently 3 ways to link 2 "related" blogposts.

* categories and tags .. proliferation breeds confusion, artificial complexities..

* links of various forms
** opaque URL
** "see also the blogpost on xxx"
** underlined phrase

When I feel the need for two-way linking, I often merge the posts into one big post.

* a big blogpost with multiple sections cross-referencing. I think it's OK to have two separate big sections, possibly overlapping. No need to consolidate.
** There are often memorable alias posts pointing to such a big blogpost.

for many years after I left NUS, my #1 favorite harbor was the library. I also used fast-food restaurants and MRT trains.

I always brought study material + other reading material.

Nowadays I worry less about opening hours because I could sit in bus interchange with A/C + free wifi. This is a form of adaptation (see the blogpost) and resilience.

I fee lucky to have the library, the free wifi in various locations, the laptop, git-blogg infrastructure. Nowadays I mostly use therapeutic blogging to recover, restore, calm down. 

Maybe I should start using more study materials for zqbx, for burn. Get on the offensive?

I think this is similar to CSY's attitude on coding drill.
It is also similar to my yoga practice. Now I share my yoga story with so many friends, as inspiration, even though I'm not highly successful.

How did I overcame the inertia on tax filing, ..

-- j4 wpress course
The wpress course is heavy on page look-n-feel customization.
I hate this aspect and would not make good progress without this course.
I already spent real money on dhost. This is one way to leverage on that. I can set up multiple subdomains each for a landing page. My advantage over other newbies.
I already spent huge effort learning wpress. this is one way to leverage on that.
wpress has many books in library. Am good at learning from books.
