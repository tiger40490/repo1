--update blogpost on 随遇而安
The pressure to perform would likely create real stress in the family, as i'm not as 'carefree' as in Bayonne.

I believe at a high salary or as the first technolgy hire for Julian, expectation would be rather high. Can I withstand the pressure as Saurabh did? I feel some of the past stigmas would come back to haunt me.

Can I have the "courage" to do what Ashish suggested ... in 6 months? Not sure.

Grandpa (and many advisors) said "Do your best and if they decide it's a role mismatch then look for another job". That's basically the Macq and the Qz experience. Too painful. In those two jobs, did I learn coping strategies to manage the pressure? I hope so.

------new blogpost: versioned dict #indeed
Q: Suppose a resume/CV consists of key/value pairs of strings. Within a resume, the keys are non-repeating. We need to support two operations -- 
* Each write(key, value) operation creates or updates a key with a new value, and returns an incremented integer vid i.e. version ID. A version ID represents a point in history, i.e. a snapshot of the resume.
* Each read(vid) returns a key/value dictionary as a complete resume at the specified snapshot
* I think in a realistic system, we also need a deleteVersion(vid) but no need to optimize for it

By definition, the initial version is an empty version 0.

Q: design an efficient solution. 
Q: after creating N versions, what's the (time and space) complexity of next write()? What's the complexity of the next read()?

Let's say there are K fields in resume version N. Note K <= N. I didn't differentiate K and N, which is useful for my clarity of thinking.

For instance, a simple solution would snapshot entire resume at each write() i.e. each version. Space complexity is bad (but I now believe time complexity is more important.) Worst case -- there are N keys in the resume as version1 creates key1, version 5 creates key5 etc.

A single read() is presumably O(K) just to read the K fields. I firmly believed this was the theoretically limit for time complexity of read(), because I was thinking of network serialization -- either my system or client system need to iterate over all fields of the dict.  Now in hind sight I feel interviewer was thinking in java mode -- to return entire dict by reference is O(1) rather than O(K) ... I didn't get the hint from interviewer when he said O(K) read was not really the lowest time complexity.

Each write() clones the dict for a new vid and saves the new dict in a vector of pointers (!) . This cloning is O(K) if there are N fields already.

Based on this idea, My design 1 used a vector for each key. However, my read() had to create a dict to be returned, on the fly in O(K). I didn't think of return-by-reference/pointer.

My design 2 is a minor optimization to remove the cloning of unchanged values. I thought I was on to something efficient but in java (and python?), all strings are copied by reference so my optimization doesn't mean much in java.

My design 3 is lazy write. So write() only appends to one of the N vectors. The other N-1 vectors are updated only when needed by a later read() or write(). Amortized cost?

My design 4 uses RBTree to optimize for frequent write() at O(1). Each write appends on one tree. STL insert with hint is O(1). No such feature in java or python.
Read(vid) requires binary search in each tree. After N updates, total node count across all RBTrees is N, so even a naive search would not exceed O(N). 

Now i feel a big string representing the entire resume is still under 100KB. I assumed were were talking about millions of fields of gigabytes each.

--healthy diet tips given by SG HPB #orange
recommended -- sugar substitutes; sugar-free drinks; Chinese tea
orange is safe even though not leanest. Orange is not as low-cal as some veg but Singapore HPB (and many experts would agree) picked orange as the safest food. 
--new blog: yoga: no visPgress no long-term impact?
i do feel really strong and powerful.
I wonder why I feel so motivated to keep up the effort
i think it's about prevention .. of body aging. Tyler@RetroFigness agrees
change your perception. be mindful of the everyday consequences of losing flexibility. Some people stay flexible as they age but most people lose it.

My faith is that the Less effort I put in now, the earlier my wellness will decline. Tyler said there is real evidence

The key moment is when I see old people. The flexible ones vs the stiff ones. 
i can't afford to let my body go tighter and more stiff more fragile. 
Whether or not yoga works, i must do it.
I have blind faith that yoga will have (or already had) semi-visible long-term impacts on the inevitable aging of my body. 
My body is a gift from my parents and I need to take care of it. 
The strength of this inner faith is proportional to my absorbency, commitment, tolerance of pain, ...
