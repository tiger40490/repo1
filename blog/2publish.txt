-- update 4 def@success or new: quiet idle time
At my age and my level of ffree, why do I still worry about coblood waste, and too much idle time?
Well, ezlife is not "complete" success. zqbx is a crucial one of the 4 def@success

Time wasted in pain, or other unintended wastes of time are always regrettable and should be minimized. 

Planned idle time can be free of pain. 
To me, quiet idle time is a prolonged period of doing nothing, free of extraneous stimuations. Boredom can be good, as a BBC program reported.
I guess quiet idle time can be a deeper recharge but today I will assume this deeper recharge doesn't work for everyone.

I think quiet idle time is not bad for some retirees and some younger people. So far, I have limited appreciation for quiet idle time.  Jacob of ERE pointed out the "freedom TO" challenge. 90% of the time, I still have goals, and purposes and I still push myself towards them.

One growing purpose is the need to live longer for my kids. (Longevity requires long-term effort, practice and time.) I feel I can add value to their lives. If I live longer, I can better control my surplus assets and decide how to use it to help my children and possibly their children.

what's in common between:
* comparison-shopping for tiny savings
* curiosity google searches including wikipedia or news reading
* lots of time spent on FSM, robinhood,,, with small trades

All of these are pleasurable and common well-accepted recreations. All entail huge cumulative tcost.

My income is not rising as much as my cohort
My skillset is not broad enough. I'm boxed in and have a single narrow skillset compared to my cohort.
not learning enough, not competent enough
short runway .. by age 30 I am expected to be competent, independent, possibly a team lead
too many choices
long struggle ahead, over 40Y
"Is this domain right for me? Will I regret?"
peer pressure on all fronts

1) wellness lifestyle improvements like yoga, sustainable diet habits, BMI
2) dev-till-70 accu, plowback,,, including QQ and CIV
? academic parenting? No. I prioritize motivation, bonding, coaching 
? prepare for relocation to U.S. including car ownership, burn rate control

--new: % allocate spare time
See also blogpost on Luke Su and spare time accounting
First let me present my pratical (hopefully valuable) quantification of spare time: excluding required work time (+commute), essential family-support time (+repairs), bio-time (sleep, nutrition/preparation)
Second, let's name the G3 non-overlapping allocations excluding the hard-to-estimate unused time. Note Blogging is a "mixin" element.
* 20% pff. Am reducing it from 40%
* 20% parenting including seeking help. Am increasing it from 5%
* 20% workout + wellness research; tech xx including localSys + body-building
* 40% other blogging

If I put in more than 3 items, then I tend to spend too much time fine-tuning the estimates but these estimates are not so useful in hind sight.

-- new or update post on blog titles
I like titles with a power phrase or a sharp(ideally short) question. 
These blogposts follow the news journalist tradition, and tries to analyze the given topic from various angles.

These titles are one solution to the proliferation of blog posts.

== new ## tips on tag/cat naming
If a word ends in gg/tt/pp etc followed by -ing, we should drop the "-ing". For example, blogg, tagg
-- category naming only
Categories are hierarchical. Some info can be inferred from the parent category and can be omitted.

Category sorting matters, esp. in the listing page, when I pick a category from the dropdown to display.

To "control" sorting, hot categories need two alternative names. For example, an1kang1/wellness would sort to top, while wellness/an1kang1 would sort to bottom.

If a category need to sort to top but lacks a good alternative name, then prefix 0, temporarily.
If a category must sort to bottom but lacks a good alternative name, then prefix x_, permanently.

-- new: [21] chat with Alina #
The CTO is a workholic, working 10am - 1am. I see wrong priorities in that, esp. viewed at the deathbed. The company, the profit, is not an achievement considered worthwhile in the END.
Those achievements are part of personal "success" only in the exclub sense.

I told Alina my priorities have shifted to wellness [longevity, 5/wk] as I need more money only half-heartedly. I think this is similar to MMM attitude.

How much is "enough money"? Remember the latency discussion, and other blogposts.

Alina shared her experience about renting, and said she really wanted home ownership. I find this sentiment rather deep-rooted. Those young professionals in top China cities seem to be trapped. Residential properties are pushed (by hot money) beyond their reach. Many people probably want to avoid this "game" but they also feel renting is not sustainable not satisfactory.
I feel U.S. culture is different. Many smart Americans (including some middle-class Americans) stay renting long-term by choice.

Taking a step back, I guess my /drive/ towards ctbz/economizing, breakaway, conserver/minimalistic lifestyle, focus on livelihood(not FOFO),,, is hard for many in Alina's cohort. I guess that's why my level of carefree Fuller wealth is possibly beyond their reach(望尘莫及).

-- new: desparate: healthy lifestyle
Kenneth.Lew is the first to mention "desperate" in the RTS gym.

Daily stretch is supposed to be essential, but evidence is too weak to change people's behavior. 
I wonder what convincing evidence would provide sufficient absorbency for daily 1m practice.
I wonder what convincing evidence would provide sufficient absorbency for daily 30m practice.

workout 5 days a week is the recommendation, but 90% of adults can't find the absorbency/time.

Daily flossing is recommended but I won't do it until my teeth give me big big problems.

Frequent refresh is important to my son's academic studies, but he doesn't recognize it.

-- update post on college ranking
Within the U.S. the most important ranking is the U.S.News. I think it gives an idea of the acceptance rate of each college

Academic reputation of a college is correlated to the size. A large, less exclusive college can produce many award winners and renowned experts. Example:
Berkeley?
Connell?
UCLA?
U London

-- new: chin-up
A realistic goal would be one a day, but such a goal doens't generate positive feedback. 
I remember my yoga goal was one minute a day. I managed to change my perception to feel good about it.

For chin-up, I need the same change of perception.

retraining chin-up (and stretch) is dreadful but not push-up or cardio

My self-talk matters. My self-talk reflects my perception of reality. This perception affects my actions.

I guess my target for chin-up is too high. I typically aim at 10 chin-up or 40 push-up in a session. 

I think the start-up is harder for chin-up. 5 chin-up = 20 push-up.
