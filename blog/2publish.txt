-- update https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/2019/12/01/yoga4life-regular-practice/
The challenge is mostly in the mind.

I was able to climb at least one flight of stairs every day when living in Blk 177 or #1173. 

-- new: Opera install
I generally prefer portable versions as they are easier in restricted environments. 
The regular download can create a a portable installation. It has comparable features as regular Opera, but it can't use the preserved bookmarks :(
To use preserved bookmarks, we need the regular install, but please don't install it into C:\programPortable, please!

I prefer the specific download with a version number and x64/x86. The default download is ambiguous can could install into a misleading location.

If free space is insufficient, the aborted installation can leave behind a litter of 200MB. If you don't clean it up manually, then in the future you won't know it is litter.

-- new: NIC, 4 little dragons
The original term "Newly Industrialized Countries" referred to these 4 east Asian economies

The current list is very interesting.

South Africa is the only NIC in Africa.
Mexico and Brazil are the only two NICs in Latam, probably leading economies
Among BRIC, only Russia is not an NIC.

Asian NICs are mostly in SEA except China and India. So in Asia, the rich list has Japan on top, the 4 little dragons below it, then SEA, then China and India. The rest are nowhere. My view is similar to the Flying Geese paradigm.

-- update low profile: reduce kidnapp risk: avoid flaunt
Don't share financial or personal information online. (If you share financial status, then highlight your limitations.)

It takes effort and risks for the gang to kidnap someone, so they seek high-return-low-risk-low-effort targets. 

-- update blog on 1st day back in office:
The recurring loss of family harmony is the most common reason I need the harbor of office. The library/stadium/MRT are also helpful.

-- update regular upkeep
dental retainers
cholesterol pills
VitD pills

--update blog on free books
As my collection of free books grows, I may realized there are too many books at home. It proved to be a recurring problem when moving home. Over the years, I have developed my preference for /travel-light/.

Jolt: Those individuals with a large book collection didn't move home as often ! They probably own many books that they seldom read. They were lucky to avoid facing the same reality I faced.

Sugg: proactively give away irrelevant books. This is slightly harder with books I bought.

Another reality with book ownership is -- our reading interests evolve with age.
Sugg: give away some titles that no longer appeal to me, perhaps after browsing through the TOC. 

-- new: scanner features
Grayscale .. between color ad b/w. Bigger files than b/w.

-- le2 wife: meimei's playground hours
screen time is less healthy, more addicitive.

playground hour is much better than screen time.

Once meimei completes her daily doses of piano and academic practics, she can play for hours downstairs.
