When I started at UChicago, what's the probability of drop-out like Shou.Liu, Henry.Yang and Chris.Ma? More than 30%

So the long journey demanded a lot of effort, commitment, perseverance ..

I needed a reason to continue. In hindsight, the branding is now fairly valuable in terms of self-image. 

-- new or fuxi: Why ibanks "support" bccy
Ibank's advertized business model is client facilitation. 
Ibanks may hold an inventory of popular bccy, and may also accept service fee payment in bccy. In such a scenario, the ibank would trade bccy for its own position, even though the claim to trade bccy only for hedging. 

In other words, ibanks are dealers rather than pure-play brokers.

Prop trading is a secret business model of ibanks.

--new: G9 SMS to break away from mainstream brainwash
t_breakaway
* My wife always feels I look too thin for my health and appearance. I remind myself "I trust my BMI analysis -- Based on years of self-monitoring, My BMI goal is well-founded. Many in my cohort would probably get better healthy longevity if they adopt similar BIM goals."

Most of the other SMS messages are related to middle-class aspirations

* Many of my peers seem to suggest my family deserves higher BR. I focus on livelihood and believe a BR equal to 80% of local median income is reasonable and adequate. By that standard, many of my peers spend way too much. 
* branded college .. Can I accept if my kids only get into community college or polytechnic? This mainstream brainwash is still hitting me hard 
* home size
* car ownership .. In the U.S., and even in SG, my peers take up car ownership for convenience, not livelihood. 
* career longevity is more important than salary; healthy longevity is more important than financial security

Buy Hey, I don't need more money, more brank, more status, more clout.

-- new: scale-out favored by tech propaganda
The propaganda and the simplistic view favors scale-out. However, scale-out can underperform.

similarly, multithreaded qsort can be slower than single-threaded. 

The original paper on COST (Configuration that Outperforms a Single Thread) asserts that 
The unoptimized implementation "scales" far better, despite (or rather, because of) its inferior instance performance. 

The COST of a given platform for a given problem is the count of cpu cores required before the platform outperforms an optimized single-threaded implementation.

The COST can be hundreds of cores. That many cores may be required by a given scale-out platform to beat a single-threaded implmenetation. If you grow an army of tadpoles against a whale in a tug-of-war, you need an army of millions.

--update zero sum game
bccy and gold are zero sum games by definition since there's no income generated. 
However, gold is natural inflation-hedge. Since our accounting currency is a fiat currency, gold is hopefully better than a zero-sum game, only over the long-term.

-- new life chances in each country.
Now I feel those in Taiwan get fewer life chances due to the stagnant economy. After finishing education, many go to mainland for more life chances. In Taiwan, even if you are reasonably smart and hardworking, the chance of earning a U.S. level salary is quite small. Actually, in the last sentence I used an arbitrary criteria.

Since 2019, the Hongkong residents are also experiencing a decline in life chances.

For many years, I have felt varioius SEAsia nationals have better life chances when thy emmigrate to SG, HK, White English-speaking countries [UK, Australia].
