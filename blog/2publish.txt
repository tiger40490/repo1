--new: long-term benefit of burn rate tracking
(T_abovePeers, prjn)
I spend about 1-2H/month on reconciliation (painstaking), followed by N hours of reflection. Total reconcilation tcost is probably unchanged though reconciliation frequence grew from twice/Y to 12/Y.

Detailed expense tracking gives me critical insight 
* where I could realistic cut waste, and by how much
* what expenses are less elastic, i.e. hard to cut
* after kids grow up, what core burn rate my wife and me would hit
* why nobody else believes in my burn rate projection but I should believe it
* why the hell my peers' family burn so fast
* a better estimate (more than a guesstimate) of my saving rate and NAV growth rate

--new: 12M-delay(!!repeat)in SG school 
If despite our best efforts we need to quit U.S. and return to SG, we don't have to see it as losing a million dollars. We can consider an international school, or get boy to join a JC as an older student. Remember HJC classmate Zhong Xiong.

Some China students join a U.S. school as an older student so they don't get bullied, and more mature against bad influences.

I too was delayed for 1.5 years but excelled in HJC. I accepted it very grudgingly. My parents were unashamed, unapologetic.

I also had many NUS classmates a few years older than the majority.

..consider IB school for boy
earmark 30k/Y tuition

Once he leaves the public school system, he can't come back!

bring boy to visit some of them? He may prefer an IB school to a public school !

If I lose my MLP job, I have 3M of compensation but I would need to immediately start the U.S. relocation. Boy would have little choice but move to U.S.

--new jolt: absorbency and effort
my criticism on boy is mostly about effort and absorbency. 
but my own absorbency is also limited. So is my wife's absorbency. 五十步笑百步。 I'm unable to do x leetcode problems a week!
Compared to him, I think I know the long-term consequences better.

I think my son is making some effort. His math talent and absorbency (abilities) is limited. If that's the case we have limited reason to blame him. We should accept him as he is. Perseverence is questionable. When I used perseverance to push myself into doing push-up, sit-up, forward-bend in my Sec 2, I couldn't last. 

Is Absorbency part of effort or abilities? Now I don't know. In my case, it's abilities. In my son, i tend to see it as effort... double standard!

--new jolt: average school in US^SG 
I once said US average schools can be condusive and good for my son.
I would say SG average schools are even safer, stricter, but not necessarily more condusive.

--new: long commute for boy?
Thanks to MLP, I can send him to school then go to office late.

However, both me and him would lose about an hour/day on commute. Is it sustainable?
