--update blogpost on sg19 priorities
salary is really something to play down... as I don't need to compare with the joneses
Real decision -- if I give in to the temptation and try the banks i will get interviews for sure and likely receive big offers.
need to avoid them (even the non-US) as they don't serve to open up new markets and can be more stressful

11. respect, benchmark, stigma, damaged good
33. c++ rather than java
