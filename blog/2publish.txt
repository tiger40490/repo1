I guess the ERE author can say he is living his life to the fullest. I don't need to benchmark with him. Similar to him, or unlike him, I do feel I'm living my life to the fullest. There's nothing missing in my current carefree life. My current life is satisfying and complete.

The Bhuddist would say there's still a lot of unsatisfied desires and pains lurking beneath the surface. Admittedly, the pains will surface, but they become mild and forgotten. 

The current condition is obviously impermanent, and possibly short-lived, but in this blogpost I don't care.

green Cornerstone: rewarding, unstressful job
red Cornerstone: boycott to FOMO/FOLB
red Cornerstone: Brbr, ffree
old foundation: health, marriage, citizenship

The red cornerstones are based on cashflow.
