-- new: NIC, 4 little dragons
The original term "Newly Industrialized Countries" referred to these 4 east Asian economies

The current list is very interesting.

South Africa is the only NIC in Africa.
Mexico and Brazil are the only two NICs in Latam, probably leading economies
Among BRIC, only Russia is not an NIC.

Asian NICs are mostly in SEA except China and India. So in Asia, the rich list has Japan on top, the 4 little dragons below it, then SEA, then China and India. The rest are nowhere. My view is similar to the Flying Geese paradigm.

-- update low profile: reduce kidnapp risk: avoid flaunt
Don't share financial or personal information online. (If you share financial status, then highlight your limitations.)

It takes effort and risks for the gang to kidnap someone, so they seek high-return-low-risk-low-effort targets. 

-- update blog on 1st day back in office:
The recurring loss of family harmony is the most common reason I need the harbor of office. The library/stadium/MRT are also helpful.

--update blog on free books
As my collection of free books grows, I may realized there are too many books at home. It proved to be a recurring problem when moving home. Over the years, I have developed my preference for /travel-light/.

Jolt: Those individuals with a large book collection didn't move home as often ! They probably own many books that they seldom read. They were lucky to avoid facing the same reality I faced.

Sugg: proactively give away irrelevant books. This is slightly harder with books I bought.

Another reality with book ownership is -- our reading interests evolve with age.
Sugg: give away some titles that no longer appeal to me, perhaps after browsing through the TOC.

-- le2 wife: meimei's playground hours
screen time is less healthy, more addicitive.

playground hour is much better than screen time.

Once meimei completes her daily doses of piano and academic practics, she can play for hours downstairs.
