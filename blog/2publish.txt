--new: involuntary celibacy and sexual needs ... #already published?
Involuntary or semi-voluntary celibacy happens in frontier mining, army, rehab camps and imgrant worker dorms. 
For years until 2005 when I decided to reboot my dating "mission", I brainwashed myself, systematically for years, to believe that "my current life is complete without a sexual relationship".

Once a few months, with decreasing frequency as I aged, I would get a rude awakening as I come across sexy images of respectable (not lower-class) women, and I confront the reality that I had a deep and vast but unfulfilled sexual need systematically suppressed for years.

It is comparable to the need to have kids, desire for a healthy BMI, desire (of Chinese villagers) for a reputable degree, need for long-term financial security...

Inevitably, I would find myself struggling to /dodge/ the question "Is my current life really complete?" Sometimes it felt like a gaping hole covered with paper in my "complete" life.

I guess a sex worker would have met my needs to some extent. Some would say the sexual need I experienced was mostly biological, but a psychologist may point out the fundamental and powerful emotional undercurrents in human sexual relations. Humans are much more than animals in their sexual relations.

--new: bring tempting foods to office
Nowadays I bring the tempting foods to office.

The worst wrong-* temptation is night time at home. Even when I eat no starch, I still feel a loss-of-control. 

When I eat the same food the next morning or in office, I feel (much) more in-control.

--new: piano practice as a pastime
piano (and other music) skill is not at the same level as gaming, or sight-seeing.

More than singing, Musical skills require absorbency. Like jogging, it strengths self-efficacy, raises self-esteem, 

Musical journey is a struggle, between the level of recreational workout and benchmarked workout. 
There's some form of penalty if you don't put in a miminum amount of practice .. you end up achieving nothing and you waste your effort.
As such it demands a minimum commitment.

If I make very slow progress with a tough piece, I can feel disappointed and frustrated.

I need to select reasonable songs. what if I make very slow progress (stuck) with one song?
How do I motivate myself?

.. sink, buffer, slack resources
Piano practice is an excellent energy sink. If 3H/week, then it becomes a good reserve of slack resource, a buffer of extra time. See blogpost on buffers and alternatives.
