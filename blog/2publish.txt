--new: lifestyle improvements since Sep 2019
* starch reduction
* 11pm craving effectively managed
* more chia + flaxseed
* a lot more vegie salad
* early sleep
* elimination of starch and fat in office. I used to eat many snacks of biscuits, nuts, ..
* yoga?

Even if these improvements don't last, they are still worthwhile achievements to celebrate. They are very, very hard to achieve even if temporary

--new: fish cake
200 cal/100g, compared to 110 cal/100g of drained tuna. Should not overeat

I assume this is relatively high-quality protein.

:) Not addictive as port or chicken :)

--update blogpost on yogurt
Is it filling? yes with chia
Is it tasty as a comfort food? has potential if with honey

--new: body-fat percentage
Many people believe that body-fat percentage is more important than weight. "If most of my weight is muscle and bones, then overweight is fine, like body builders; If some healthy-weight person is full of fat, that is real health issue."

I agree that BFP is possibly more important than weight if measurable.

The problem is -- the measurement is extremely inaccurate. Any theory based on an unmeasurable quantity can't be a useful theory.

proven to be AS effective as medicines

without the AS, it sounds wrong
