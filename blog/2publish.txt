--new: left-over noodles
when I turned down wife's invitation to finish meimei's left-over noodles at Vivocity, it was the archetypical daily battle.
wrong-time temptation is the opponent of this battle. Every time I concede a heavy calorie casulty, it had better be a conscious decision [1], not a mindless action, going with the flow.

This conscious decision requires a certain tcost that I need to understand. Not tcost of nutritional research but a tcost of thinking through and making that decisions [1] -- tcost of fighting THE battle.

There are so many such daily battles everyday. The tcost adds up.
There's a huge roti to this huge tcost -- as I change my habits, I would change my destiny. 

[1] Am not advocating impossibly tough abstinence. Am advocating conscious decision based on quick but highly personal cost/benefit analysis.

Earlier in the same day, I made a conscious decision to eat grandma's cornflour bread, millet porridge with fresh onion, fish and long beans. That was a lighter and much healthier meal than the left-over noodles! 

Later in the same day, I made a conscious decision to eat a sweet dessert at Vivocity Kopitiam. Less starchy, lots of ice, therefore much lighter.

Both meals are more satisfying !

--new: t-spillage]workout
eg: 10 min actual swim takes 30 min in the water, and at least 1 hour total due to commute + shower etc
eg: 50 min yoga class requires about 3H including wind-down.

For these workouts, if you try to reduce the 'spillage' you may hit a stonewall.

eg: jogging has much lower spillage
eg: mini-workout has the lowest spillage

I used to undervalue the Roti of workout
Now I feel prioritizing workout (over other t-spend) means accepting the spillage
