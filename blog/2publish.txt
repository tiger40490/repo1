-- new: background heat: car ownership considered harmful
Trigger: Singapore consumer education promotes public transport, walk, cycle, rather than private cars.

The (mental) wellness impact, and to a lesser extent the eco factor, are (harmful) "background heat" -- a home-grown term not laden with meanings).

Some frequent drivers (7+ trips/wk) may pass all health screenings. If you are one of them, you may not care about the backgroune heat. 
You may feel your "system" can cope with the harmful background heat.
However, over decades the heat tend to grow /heavier/, less negligible, and accmulate an enduring/permanent effect on a person's life chances and well-being.

classic background heat is invisible stress of some large difficult project like Quarz, 

Another example is tax filing.

-- new: triple trip2fetch phone left@home: +ve perception
Today I left my mobile phone at home, so I came to office and quickly decided to go back and fetch it. 
A few years ago in the same situation, I used to feel bitter/resentful because I focused on the negative side:
* family members unable to help me... no obligation
* I would have to pay a few dollars for commute 
* I have just arrived in office and have not done any work
* I must return to office (rather than working from home) due to a meeting [PMA walk through]
* I will miss a 3pm meeting, though I could try to dial in during my commute

Just 2 or 3 items were enough to paint the whole thing bloody. Instead, this time I focused on the positive elements:
* my workload is low, without urgent deliverables
* my work hours are flexible
* my commute is rather short, with minimal walk on both ends
* I could read on the train, with a seat (offpeak hours)

This is a simple and powerful illustration of positive perception.

~~ Citi JE branch visit
I was feeling bitter about the wasted trip, but hey, I was free on that day, and wanted to explore.

I had a valid reason to visit it. On such trips, there's always a probability of "waste". It's like market risk.

-- new or update bpost on quality time.. Every family outing must count
Almost everyone involved is busy and each has to make adjustments to make it happen.

For years, I resented the huge hours lost after a movie -- time spent shopping or at nearby playgrounds. I realized that after a family movie, I should go straight home.
Then in 2022 I slowly changed my behavior. After a Stadium trip, we spent hours in Decathlon. 
Around Christomas 2022, we went to IMM to buy a pair of shoes but spent 5 - 8 hours there ! Still regretful but less painful.

13 Nov family outing trip was very low productivity, "rot". 
Somehow I avoided the burn-rot trap of self-hate. 
I used to be a hostage. The high standad of productivity was simply unrealistic with family outing. 

In contrast, I think a corporate team-building event could be (would be) benchmarked for efficiency, but that's for the organizer. 
Most participants would be too relaxed and fail the benchmark. 
Family members are more like the participants rather than the organizers.
