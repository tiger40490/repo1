--new blogpost: frq@stretching
try to stretch for 10 min on the body part you last used
aim for 2-3 such stretches a week. 
If you can't then I would say aim for 2 minutes twice a week.

--new blogpost: less is more
calorie restriction means reduce starch, fried or creamy food. Most of the delicious foods are now reduced to my tolerable limit, without depriving myself.

Less is more. More health, more vitality, more confidence, more self-esteem. 

However, the self-esteem should NOT be based on false beliefs and brainwash/propaganda.

--too much SGD or USD?
After we relocate to U.S. we will have some SGD reserve, growing thanks to HDB rental income. What use do we have for this growing pile of SGD? 
* perhaps as wife's reserve. I think she prefers SGD
* perhaps to top up CPF 
* Perhaps to hedge against USD devaluation. 
* Perhaps convert to USD to invest in US or Asia.
* put my surplus SGD into CPF-life at age 55.

Until the relocation, I think my USD would be in surplus. 
However, any property big buy is likely in USD, but unlikely in SG

When USD is on the rise, I have a chance to gain "access" to it by converting to SGD. Worst case it goes up further and never comes down

--new: notepad++ in-place sorting
If case-sensitive, the best way is Edit->LineOperations

If case-insensitive, then no native support. A few options:
* option: git-bash q[sort] but no in-place sorting
* option: right-click on the file name, then copy the filename to clipboard. Then openContainingFolderInDOS. Run sort fileName /o fileName 
* option: TextFX plugin
