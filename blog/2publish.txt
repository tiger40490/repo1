--update on ZhuJiang:
most tech start-ups don't make you rich. I can see the reality in SG. As to U.S. I have reason to believe not so different.

--new: involuntary celibacy and sexual needs
Involuntary or semi-voluntary celibacy happens in frontier mining, army, rehab camps and imgrant worker dorms. 
For years until 2005 when I decided to reboot my dating "mission", I brainwashed myself, systematically for years, to believe that "my current life is complete without a sexual relationship".

Once a few months, with decreasing frequency as I aged, I would get a rude awakening as I come across sexy images of respectable (not lower-class) women, and I confront the reality that I had a deep and vast but unfulfilled sexual need systematically suppressed for years.

It is comparable to the need to have kids, desire for a healthy BMI, desire (of Chinese villagers) for a reputable degree, need for long-term financial security...

Inevitably, I would find myself struggling to /dodge/ the question "Is my current life really complete?" Sometimes it felt like a gaping hole covered with paper in my "complete" life.

I guess a sex worker would have met my needs to some extent. Some would say the sexual need I experienced was mostly biological, but a psychologist may point out the fundamental and powerful emotional undercurrents in human sexual relations. Humans are much more than animals in their sexual relations.

--update good life
Walking down the street and looking at well-dressed women, I get "sms" about 

jogging on waterfront
yoga
piano
avocado smoothie

These are typical feminine /indulgences/, but for me these efforts require absorbency. They provide me more than "simple good life".... they make me feel /privileged/.

These and other *quality-time* spent in self-care, life-enhancement ... is kinda important to my experience and sense of "good life".
