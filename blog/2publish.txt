--new: basketball: years@practices..mediocre player
In my high school, there were a few focused self-practices that failed to create a visible lead over my peers
* fwd bend
* basketball? I improved my drible and shooting significantly but not enough for a competitive game.
* 400m run

How did I react?

How can my son learn from it?

Despite the "no growing lead", I would say I have reaped dividend for years iFF I give up the fixation on "lead" and look beyond the competitive scene. I was able to enjoy basketball much more, and take part in many non-competitive games. My fwd bend is a good part of my tight Y-junfction.

--new: unlimited desire
The Buddha observed that human desires are satisfied only temporarily.

I don't desire eternal youth. I do want healthy longevity. Limitless desire? Yes if scentifically achievable.

I don't have endless lust or craving for novelty in sex life.

Financially, since 2018 I have felt satisfied with my current cashflow high ground. I do long for even more assurance of family livelihood, in terms of career longevity, inflation protection, healthcare assurance ... 

I am more and more aware that "financial livelihood" (including healthcare resources) is easier to control than personal health. So my current level of livelihood protections are adequate and I do not need to long for ever higher assurance.

So what imaginary role model do I envy most? Not a big manager with his work/life balance and stress level. I guess cash flow higher ground is enviable, but I'm not that bad.

Basically, the only unlimited desire in me is healthy longevity.
