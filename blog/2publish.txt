--new: ffree=unrealistic4some Chinese middle-class
(oth? The state of mind is important to me. The peer comparison is bound to affect me from time to time.) 
talking to Jack Zhang and Henry Yin, I feel the stereotypical Chinese middle class (my own peer group) is basically hopeless to achieve ffree. 
Their idea of "enough" non-work income is something like USD10k/month. 

I feel that's not serious, therefore naive. Here we are talking about affluence rather than ultra-rich, so our concept of ffree is not "spending-as-much-as-we-want". ffree rests upon responsible, disciplined spending, budgeting, making-ends-meet.

Responsible is the keyword -- review, account for and adjust our quarterly expenses. If you don't enjoy this "responsibility", then ffree will be a pain.

During my q3sg years, I concluded (and declared repeatedly) that my wife and I can be realistically satisfied with SGD 3k non-work income. Perhaps 5k as a family of 4.

Location is key. Housing, medical cost and education are some of the biggest concerns. 

I achieved my barebones ffree precisely because I have my answers to each question.

The early-retirement-extreme author also has answers to each question.

i feel good but not conceited about my burn rate + savings rate. Also proud of my passive income. This is a constant wellspring of positive feeling. Hopefully no attachment. 

I mention my ffree to many people and I start to feel positive about it, hopefully not losing my feet on the ground.

If we keep control over our burn rate, barebones ffree is not unrealistic, largely thanks to medishield.

Do some people work hard towards ffree and upon arrival spend their hard-earned money like there's no tomorrow? 
I feel "unconstrained spend" is a common dream, but inconsistent with realistic practical ffree.

ffree is a state of mind. It is more than a discipline, and not a harsh discipline. It is a keen awareness of what spends are important to yourself and what aren't.

World Bank poverty line for rich countries is USD 22/day or USD 8k/Y

..some of the important (often unglamorous) thing money can get for me, roughly ranked:
healthcare such as the shield plans
short commute
[5] yoga and fitness classes 
[5] air tickets to create more reunion time
mobile blogging devices
short distance to stadium and library
[5] enough books in print or electronic form. Enough spare time to read them.
piano, drawing, painting lessons.
printers. 
[5=my G5 "overweight allocations" ... overweight as compared to peers]

--new: t-utilization: q3SG as mirror
History is a mirror.

too much low-quality time with boy. Need to be more calculating on tcost as $cost. Beware of long trips, though boy really appreciates some of them.

msfm? Huge tcost like 10~15h/week per subject, but this is often a absorbency honeymoon. I learnt a lot, though the strategic value is not considered questionable.

personal investment? too much tcost on fsm + oanda

extra time in office? too much non-work

yoga? insufficient positive feedback, too much physical pain, slightly too much $cost pressure

--email to Ashish
You said I'm now pretty good at coding interviews. I said I was just lucky.

Now I think I deserve a pat on my back. I worked hard for years and took up hundreds of coding questions from leetcode or elsewhere. 

Did the huge effort help me grow stronger? Yes

--new: long-term roti=rare; prejudice about fun time with boy
jolt
What kinda individuals like to point a finger at a school and say "So many students have failed to score 600 marks on gaokao"?

Real long-term roti is rare like a perfect score:
* yoga? not lasting
* QQ? so fake
* coding test? Only for web 2.0 shops
* per investment? mostly small scale and recreational
* ...
So why the hell do I point my figer at family time, boy's coaching sessions, outing with boy, fun time with boy, relaxed time with boy?

Any relaxed moment is seen as too easy and not burning enough. Such a burn/rot view is poisonous, and double-standard -- I don't point my finger at
* myself blogging
* myself watching youtube
* myself on recreational reading 
* myself reading news, magazines

I have been utterly prejudiced in my assessment of family-time utilization. 
* yoga -- considered not burn and low ROTI... Actually extremely hard. Arguably more strategic than the coding drill etc, 
* work out with kids -- considered not burn and low ROTI (too much wasted time) .. Actually tough, and builds family bound. Arguably no less strategic than QQ
* strength training -- considered not burn, not hard enough.
* prepare math worksheet -- considered not burn, not hard enough, not strategic, not related to my career
* review zbs -- considered not burn not IV-relevant.
* review GTD -- considered not burn not IV-relevant.
* review QQ -- considered not burn and not strategic
* bring boy out shopping as reward for him -- considered high tcost low ROTI but extremely important to his +/-ve feedback loop 

Overall, I was fixated on materialistic ROTI and self-discipline over the lazy self

--new: clarity@thinking=non-trivial strength

clarity of thinking is a non-trivial strength in me. Many friends say I'm very reflective and demonstrate Grade-A self knowledge and self analysis. 

I feel many "peers" don't show clarity of thinking. My sis, dad show clarity. I think my son may have it.

Vocab is a top-4 factor and can help a lot, esp. when a common phrase is ambiguous and confusing. To my surprise, many clear thinkers seem to use mostly a small vocab.

I explain my content very clearly to myself, not always so clearly to "them". In my view , clarity of thought is mostly a self-management skill, so I don't worry about "them".

Brevity is perhaps a top 5 clarity factor. I tend to be good in brevity of writing but Some verbal-type individuals show exceptional clarity. Genn?

My use of spreadsheet is a visual sign of clarity
