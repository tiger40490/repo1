--new: self-care in the face of parenting challenges
category: anxiety
the conflict with my son draining my energy. 
self care: I think exercise + lean diet would also help build my self-confidence

I can talk to grandpa or counsellors but more important (for parenting but not for self-care) is wife discussion. 
self care: Also more important than the discussions is blog review and git-blogging.

Sometimes work project can provide work stress, or positive stress, depending on my concentration.
I feel lucky to have short commute + the office as my sancturary.

eg of cognitive self-care: Many neighbors' kids are less academic than ah-boy, some are more academic. I don't compare with them, not excessively. 
Where I do get mad is when I see my son's laziness or poor organization. However, if his benchmark result is close to the top (perhaps in a U.S. school) then I might say he is just like CSY's son.

--new: smashing"safe"objects = slippery slope
I have damaged a toy monkey.
I have smashed a red-bean bakery.
I have damanged iPhone8 screen.

It's important to remember the collateral damages, or they could be sacrificed for nothing.

Some people don't care about the damages and therefore tend to forget them. I have an advantage that I do care about them.

--new edu resource uneven distribution
We know that educational resources are never evenly distributed. Everyone wants to get into the better schools. 
(Actually, I feel the most important education resource is the extended family. )
Singapore's resource "allocation" is more merit-based whereas other countries often have more wealth-based allocation. 

When you think of the wealth-based, you confront the exclub-wealth. Actually we are relatively OK in terms of exclub-wealth, but we would need to cut spending on other things such as overseas trips.

Luckily, I have prepared myself for years to deal with and hopefully overcome the waves of cultural shocks related to top schools, stratification, stigma, branding.

In either merit-based or wealth-based systems, you are always performance-ranked, as I said years ago. If you are a musician you may want to ignore the ranking and focus on your music. 

I happen to have a UChicago and NUS under my belt.

--new: bring tempting foods to office
Nowadays I bring the tempting foods to office.

The worst wrong-* temptation is night time at home. Even when I eat no starch, I still feel a loss-of-control. 

When I eat the same food the next morning or in office, I feel (much) more in-control.
