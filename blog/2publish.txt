~~ control over BMI
Rahul was very determined and in-control, but he might be somewhat overweight.

Many of my colleagues are overweight. I tend to assume they have poor control over diet or exercise, but I could be very wrong. 

Some slim individuals are not really better at self-control. I guess some of them are just lucky. I have many colleagues who said they are unable to put grow "stronger".

This "control" is central to successZ, but if our boy "system" is hard to control, then I think we need serenity. See the bpost on serenity

-- update (not new!) which one?
If BMI improvement affect my intimacy, then let go of the BMI. My intimacy is more important.

sexual gratification (actually, longer active sex life) is sometimes more important to me than improving BMI to 64 kg

BMI helps my CRE and chin-up, but those things are far less important than deep-green.

BMI is more important than early sleep, but early sleep probably helps my diet.

What's more important than BMI? See other bpost. freedom from ill health (aches), vitality, intimacy, longevity,,,

What's as important as BMI? muscle mass / strength. Note body fat is theoretically important but hard to measure

* Losing your healthy appetite, and becoming someone like grandpa in his late 80s, can reduce your BMI, but do you want that?
* During my covid infection, I lost appetite and BMI, but it is not worth it.

If you never lose a battle, then you are not struggling enough and your goal is not challenging enough, or you are very harsh and depriving yourself completely.

walking down stairs takes 1/3 of the "effort" as climbing
