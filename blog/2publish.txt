-- new: 2022 diversification xp
In 2022, my eq portfolio (along with SP500) experienced a major decline, raising the question of diversification.

How about bccy? (I have none) Most of them declined more than stocks... Ineffective diversification.
How about bonds? My bond mufu remain underwater since late 2021 .. Ineffective diversification.
How about my HY/PE from Jill? In default... ineffective diversification.

watching the OCBC ad, I wondered how useful diversification actually is in pff.
I think many asset classes are highly correlated... fake diversification.

Other asset classes can have a super long trough (like 30Y) after a crash, such as gold and some properties.

Some private investment schemes are shady and unregulated such as HY/PE and some bccy. So diversification using them can become fraudulent.

In conclusion, nowadays I think diversification is oversold to the general public.

A superficial diversification would involve some high-beta stocks (high correlation with SP500), some bonds, some bccy, some gold, some HY/PE, but I doubt they would provide positive return (end-to-end) in a depressed market. Such a return is what I need for liquidity.

-- new: GP chat on Quark project stress
A few key developers left, and now I'm receiving heavier projects.
I don't want to complain.

I remind myself that if I put in a real effort, then boss will not penalize me. 
The project will get done. Am positive.

boss's expectation is probably set more by internal peer benchmark, rather than c-EPA team's benchmark. Currently, there's no internal benchmark. All future projects are different from the first.

I remind myself that the other team members are younger, or better localSys, so I may not be able to reach their productivity.
I remind myself that boss probably observed it already.
There should be no shame, no rude awakening as happened in PWM-comm or Neoreo

I have a vulnerable self-esteem, sensitive to other people's evaluation of my professional competence. 
Grandpa knows me better than most people, so he immediately stressed and repeated that I have good work ethicks, and conscience. 
GP pointed out that I do put in lots of effort, but need to watch out for self-imposed stress.
Basically, don't take things too seriously.

-- new: OC bond mufu
Why the OC mufu is not something to buy-n-hold?
One reason is expRatio.

Shall we ask some OC senior advisor?
-- update bpost on PMA
PMA has non-trivial complexity and functionality but is low-maintenance. A rare gem of quality and well-designed enterprise software.

Better than Raptor, Guardian, Nautilus, FSV2 and many other systems.

However, it does require the app owner to be pro-active in learning the internals. 

New support staff would need logs + DB read access + documentation.

Many guys can GTD like monkey coding, while many half-trained medics or students can treat ailments.

However, the six-figure SWE jobs require a level of expertise like physicians.

eg: I put my interdental floss on my desk as a constant reminder. I use it once a few months, but it is still worth it.
eg: I put my grip trainer on my desk as a constant reminder. I use it once a few months, but it is still worth it.
eg: I installed my pull-up bar at home years ago. For years I didn't use it but it was a constant reminder. Now I use it every week
eg: I installed my punchbag at home. Now I use it once a few months, but it's a huge reminder.
eg: company provides standing desk to everyone. Sometimes I use it once a week, but the gap between usage can grow to a few months. Yet it's still worthwhile.
eg: we bought dozens of books from China and positioned them in "prime" locations. Kids pick up one book in a year. Perhaps not worth it
