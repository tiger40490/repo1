In each "competitive" case, you build up competitive strength over J years but may lose it in K years. Each strength has very different long-term impacts, not "zero" (transient) as we sometimes perceived them to be.

Valuable resources are scarce and is a competition. Therefore this competitive profile has long term impact on health, mental aging, stress level, job choices, commute, amount of annual leave.

Any higher ROTI?

You can say every woman's natural beauty has imperfections when you see that woman everyday. This is because our idea of perfect beauty is based on paintings and photos, not live humans. Similarly, every endeavor's ROTI has imperfections compared to our naive, idealized concepts.

If you look for imperfections you will always find some.... but such fixation on imperfections is cynical, demoralizing and unproductive research

low level QQ -- my strength
low level investigation using tools + codebase -- my weakness
picking up new GTD challenges -- my relative weakness
picking up new IV topic -- my relative strength
