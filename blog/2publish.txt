--new: no stress no gain
BMI, diet, yoga, workout ... all demand mental effort, focus and stress. 

A bullet fired towards a target is in free motion... hit or miss, but for a missile to aim at a moving target and adjust its flight, control is required.
As soon as we set an (however vague) expectation and take aim, we take on a challenge and set ourself up for stress.

Our self-esteem is now at stake.

Similarly the coding drill...

My son may not have this self-control yet.
