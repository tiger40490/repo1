--update Gabbar
I don't want to spend on popularized, commercial priorities like car, luxury housing, branded schools. 

I'm willing to spend on my personal priorities such as family reunion trips, low-stress/low-pay jobs (like Mvea, Citi...)
I think the issue of maid is similar.

I enjoy a high brbr and FullerWealth (my priorities), but to them, those priorities may look like saving money for nothing.
==new: revesable decline
I think most wellness declines are irreversable due to aging, but in this blogpost I want to focus exclusively on the exception

-- eye sight .. irreversable
-- chin-up .. I experienced multiple declines. See separate blogpost
-- jogging endurance .. Whenever I restart after a few months, I always felt "heavy" but I usually recover within a few weeks.
-- lower back pains .. recovered
-- heel pains .. recovered. Now I can ran barefoot again.
-- BMI decline
-- flexibility overall decline .. I improved shoulder (back lock) and improved lotus on hard benches or airport/cabin seats

-- update uchicago ending on a high note
without uchicago uplifting, my mental self-portrait would be permanently blemished with tiny scars, labelled with a B .. all due to the NUS grades [2nd class]. 

Look at Venkat of OC and the Shankar of Polaris. No amount of professional accomplishment would be sufficient to overcome that permanent label. The most one can do about that label, is to look at the big picture and refuse to be enslaved by the label.

Should I update the list of j4/ROTI of Uchicago?
