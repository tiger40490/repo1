--new: good at pushing myself
am good at pushing myself to the limit, sometimes beyond my limit, even if i may not be "good at" them in a competitive sense.
* yoga
* jogging
* coding drill
* camp out

coding drill is the most interesting case study. Other people may complete more problems, but i probably spend more time
* Ranked by number of problems, i'm just average
* ranked by hours spent, I'm much higher
* ranked by effort, I'm even higher, as I push myself harder than others

--new: contract rate is not benchmarked against FTE
If my contract rate is higher than FTE team members, we explain that it's not comparable as my employer gets a cut and I also pay more taxes and have no benefits like paid leaves.

If my contract rate is lower than FTE team members, then we often say it's due to market rate. Not sure why, but I don't feel inferior. 

This factor becomes crucial in a PIP situation. The FTE victim would get a donut bonus and donut raise, and her base would fall below some very junior team members .. unbearable humiliation. 
No such humiliation on a non-performing contractor even if his rate is below a grad. Nobody cares about the benchmark.
