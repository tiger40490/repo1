Re my blogpost of China peers hopeless to achieve ffree.

I have achieved basic ffree. So my peerComp pain (one of the 2 main pains) is like the rich feeling outpaced by a tycoon... endless greed, mindless peer comparison.

after talking to Gary, I realized that I could be ffree but not free from pain --- if I see other people earning a lot more and their family enjoying those things I used to dismiss as unnecessary...

I would feel left behind. I think Henry Yin also hinted at the same.

The tendency to compare to our neighbors is ... a basic human tendency, like envy. Even a child can experience that. However, it takes a rational mind (wisdom) to control the tendency.

What did grandpa say when I said my son would go to an average school while other Chinese families mostly live in top school districts.

what would the early-retirement-extreme author say?
