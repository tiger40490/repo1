-- new: 领头羊
I remember ML's friend, the 领头羊 guy desribing his persistent headache. 
At that time I was envious of his exclub and successC.
Now I think his xpSelf suffered for years. He looked like a failureE. Not enviable at all.


-- slowcooking update bpost on brush-off
reflections on the 92S27 reunion in May 2022

I told grandpa later on "not worth my envy: their cars, expensive homes, maids, top schools for their kids". These are often white elephants.
This is part of my emerging wisdom as a greying and thinking adult.

I also told grandpa that my skills are in demand, with market depth in a growing sector. 
I want to actively reduce attachment to the EPA comfort zone.

I tend to brush off my advantages in diet, workout, bonding with kids, brbr, cashflow high ground, lifelong learning.
Many of my advantages over these ex-classmates are in successE and successZ.

In whatever that matter to me, I don't feel left behind. I am getting ahead, in stealthy footsteps.

-- update https://btv-gz.dreamhosters.com/5652/java-one-of-top3-reason-for-my-pain-in-singapore/
if I lose MLP job and decide to remain in SG, I would face a much smaller finDev job pool with too many competitors. The buy-side jobs would be too demanding, age-unfriendly. The crypto jobs would be age-unfriendly. The ibank jobs would be much fewer than in WSt. I would have less-than-ideal job choices like Qz and OC job.

-- LG2 update which one? bpost on speed coding or NBA?
Street dance ^ eGaming ^ speed coding
Street dance skill can't make money for you.
Singing is similar.
Piano is similar but .... can teach... There's a good demand.

basketball talent .. Top 0.1% can make money

Speed coding is very different. Many companies are interested to hire you.


-- update https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/14830/covid19-recession-am-richer-even-without-deflation/
Inflation, recession, covid restrictions, rental income decline, health decline due to aging
.. are some of the common "stressors" that have not become my stressors, because they affect many people around me more seriously.

Q: What's special about long commute? Why do I suffer so much while others don't?
A: 49 out of 50 of my peers can tolerate it better than I can, just as in an economy seat on a long flight.


-- update bpost on commute (which one?)
Need to balance 2 priorities (3 would be max)
logistical efficiency .. printed material (without need4writing) is far more efficient than git-blogg esp. for short trips or with transfers
productivity zsms .. laptop with coding or tech QQ, or tech books 

When is best time for git-blogg? Looks like an unwanted child. Commute is a good choice, even if not the very best.
When is best time for my growing recreational books? In office and home

-- update: jenkins 
.. is like IDE skill (including git) -- non-trivial, with some GTD value but zero QQ value, never quizzed
This perception can have a poisonous effect on my localSys xx motivation.


-- new: OC bond mufu
Why is the OC mufu not something to buy-n-hold?
One reason is expRatio. Is there some long-term trend? I don't see it.

Shall we ask some OC senior advisor?


-- update bpost on gems in the unit:
Remind ourselves to adjust our perception to notice the gems in the unit
* new tiles with horizontal edges, will be easier to drill
* plenty of vertical space in laundry room, toilets,, for storage


-- new Chinese culture: 基本功
link to https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/10886/math-china-students-advantage-is-short-lived/
Chinese culture (and to some extent Eastern Europe, and East Asia) is more serious, relative to the west, about fundamental skills (基本功), stringent, tough training

calligraphy
piano
street dance contest... 
ice skating
women's marathon
speed coding 

In terms of sports, China (and those neighbors) are formidable, but not stronger than the west.

In terms of tech innovation, the west still has a better system including their education philosophy/orientation.

In math, things are more nuanced. I don't know why Chinese mathmaticians are not so strong, but quant world has high Chinese representation.

In many engineering/science subjects, students don't need to be as precise as in quant. A 80% grasp is often good enough to get you an A. 

My sister often says her fellow accountants are often focused on precision and missed the big picture priorities. 

There are other competitive domains .. design, architecture, literature, music, visual arts, performance arts, business,
