-- update: seminar on DS/ML
hiring: DS + finance ... scarce
I think this means hiring team's criteria is too high, perhaps with non-trivial dnlg

Engineering is a huge effort in data science team. I think they need devops, or scripting SWE, rather than C++/java SWE. 
However, java SWE may lack know-how with certain packages.

I think BQuant is a huge investment in DS/ML/AI since 2007.
I think the two BQuant presentations represent the most commercially viable applications of BQuant DS/ML research. Both presentations offer emerging, tantatilizing value propositions. The absence of a more concrete value proposition suggests that AI/ML is still a solution looking for a problem. 

* NLP solution includes a sugar-coating UI to ease the usage of the Bloomberg terminal. The main value-add is an ingestion engine constantly analysing news articles and applying ML models to tag/index/classify content. Users can perform high-level sentiment analysis.

* intraday order-flow data analytics for pre-trade signal .. see https://btv-gz.dreamhosters.com/40285/ai-predicting-security-price-skeptical/

the Bloomberg API is mostly python, perhaps similar to PyTorch and TensorFlow.

~~ i feel these data scientists are not SWE.. seldom uses compiled language. They are users of a software platform.

java and c# are sometimes considered c/c++ applications. (In the same vein, c++ can be considered a C application since it is built on top of C.) I think this description ignores the fact that java / c# developers do need to worry about low-level details.

These data scientists. They use scripting languages and high level libraries. I think they might be similar to app developers using Angular.

They might be similar to quants who write c++ code.

However, a data science codebase can be large and complex, just not in the same way as a traditional compiled project.

However, traditional scientists don't write code. 

Does your skill as a c++/java/c# SWE make you a stronger candidate for a data science dev team, compared to a candidate coming from python, javascript, ruby etc? 
Yes but not much.

I see high churn in this domain.
