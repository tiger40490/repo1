--new: high-flyer burn rate
looking at Rahul, P.Mullins etc -- Capable professionals, but that level of minimum burn rate creates a permanent burden on their shoulders. 

I think the value-investing seminar target audience also feel a similiar burden -- How the hell can I sustain my BASIC $2k/head family lifestyle if I don't want to work so hard for 30Y and then sustain the same lifestyle beyond retirement? Their problem is really the burn rate.

In terms of burn rate, I'm blessed with a frugal wife, SG citizenship ..

The focus on the word "protection" is likely to uncover some threats I perceive consciously or subconsciouly.
[c] SG citizenship -- protects against healthcare inflation, long-term nursing co, housing cost, general inflation. Some protective benfits of SG citizenship are not measured by money -- 
* protection against poor service (common in many countries) when I'm in need of help
* protective environment for up-bringing of kids -- drug-free,,
* SG government has a large past reserve to protect Singapore against many threats.
[c] good burn rate as family -- protects against many cashflow threats. 
[c] bx plans
sound education for kids -- protects against parents' worries
[w] good sleep -- protects against workload, ,,,
[w] good diet
[w] bmi greenzone
stable marriage -- is a cornerstone and protects against many threats
harmony at home
[j] WallSt contract job market -- protects against early decline of demand
[j] IV competitiveness including theoretical skills
[j] English skill -- protects against job market competition from overseas newcomers 

[j=threat of job loss or job pain]
[c=cashflow stress or distress]
[w=welness protections]

--update Canada blogpost
The names of many Canadian and U.S. cities conjure up romatic images in my head, but to visit or retire there, main factor is 1) cost and 2) climate, 3) Chinese community

Therefore, I should consider Penang, Jiande only

--new: BMI L@ctrl: self-care^self-hate
a big part of my cabin fever is diet loss@control, esp. the wrong-time temptation.

I'm used to be in control, so the loss of control is devastating, degenerative and destructive.

self-hate, unreasonable expectation are part of the underlying.

What we need is compassion and self-care. In my preoccuation with BMI, I fail to recognize and celebrate the huge effort and success in
* avoid family meal when not hungry
* starch
* fat
* raw veg + fruits
* chia seeds

Pehraps my diet is not lost, but BMI battle is in decline. If that's the case then we need the bao3shan1 strategy.

Perhaps the increased calorie intake (presumably due to starch and fat) is directly due to coping with stress

Perhaps what I need is intermittent fasting or warrior diet. Go without starch/fat for 16H everyday.
