BigBrother was a system monitoring tool I used in 2001-2003. I remember it says if any system component has an issue, you will see some red or amber. If you find yourself in a sea of green then you are very lucky, but it probably won’t last forever.

After assigning hotkey F2 to SaveAll, we need to identify hotkey conflicts. This is better done using the search bar at bottom of the pop-up.
Without this tool, it used to adds to the legwork.... fearful

I prefer a constant-width font. Easier to line up indent across multiple lines
I prefer font size 12

-- update "yoga4life"
at twice a week, the total hours would be 3 to 5 /wk, based on my Bayonne experience. This is much more than the hours I can allocate to all other workouts combined. Therefore, the tcost is unsustainable.

Reality is, yoga isn't life-saving like kidney dialysis that must be performed weekly. Most guys are unable to do 3 sessions/week and therefore 3 sessions/week is unrealistic for most people, just like 5 workouts/week. 

The sustainable tcost has to be based on self-practice.

-- update blogpost on workout priorities https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/10950/bmi-flexible-cre-strength/
.. the need to balance enjoyments with wellness priorities 
some people (mostly men) enjoy muscle training and nothing else .. I think some  Americans do. It can affect BMI and flexibility, two of the most important aspects of wellness. I am unlikely to become bulky, but flexibility is a traditionally neglected area.

some people enjoy jogging and nothing else. It can lead to loss of flexibility and muscle as we age.

Some women do mostly yoga including some limited strength training, so they lack CRE. Therefore, some combine yoga with cardio. 

Ideally, you would want to enjoy a range of workouts, but few individuals are so lucky. For every adult and child, consistent workout is repetitive and requires a lot of effort and absorbency. Team sports and golf are more fun but requires a lot of external help.

Why is fitness class easier than self-practice?
Self-practice requires constant SMS, constant motivating (like dRam refresh), constant push beyond the comfort zone. Lots of system2 work.
For example, after a rest we need System 2 to decide when to restart, set a target and keep count.
In a class, we can relax System2 and follow the instructor and other students. System 1 is efficient.

Remember the Bayonne yoga class led by the Russian student? I didn't like her instruction but still I followed.

If it's a video, then I would not be able to "just follow it"

biggest time-consuming procedures that require focus focus

#1 ice .. sugg make ice in office and bring home
.. worry: spill while putting in .. sugg: use tight boxes
.. worry: melt too fast if outside
.. worry: some ice chunks get stuck and wasted .. sugg: ignore them, and refill the box.
.. worry: ice melting in blender if left too long .. sugg: leave ice in blender and wait only without liquid.
.. sugg: use smaller ice bags. Can fit into the other drawers.
#2 carving out avocado
.. worry: wasting.. Sugg discard more of the avocado
.. worry: contamination

--new time won't stand still
The last weekend of Oct 2021, I put in many hours 
* to add visualization
* to add more tests

Why? What's the motivation, j4 and ROTI? I asked the same question about MSFM, C#, Swing, quant self-study, python... I still don't have a good analytical framework. 

Key observation -- time won't stand still. It keeps flowing at a constant rate. Time can't be warehoused. If I don't spend my time on this coding practice, I would easily "waste" it on one of the energy sinks.

This coding drill has multiple benefits in hindsight
* the visualization emboldened me to engage Deepak, Daryl, Josh Lim, even my son. The "engagement" further enhances my "learning" .. various aspects
* my visualization is now barely usable for the "engagement", but if it is unusable, then my effort would still be a worthwhile effort. It reminds me of my pre-sales effort, my self-employment days... 
* I had a blogpost about  weekends otherwise wasted: G3 ROI@UChicago. Even if the code doesn't work, this is still zqbx. Without this zqbx, my ezlife feels decadent, wasteful and an incomplete success. 

My friends' effort and my own effort were not in vein. It restored my self-confidence as a c++ developer. The self-confidence is priceless.

NoSql is bigData, not DS/ML. 

Data Science probably favors python or R. ML is even less suitable for java.
ML includes classification, recommendation, ,, NeuralNetwork is part of ML

-- new: 2022 review: techBets, TSN
Most of my techBets and tsn ... are likely to pay lower dividends after first 10Y. 
I will receive the dividend when I change job  back to the target domain, be it bondMath, mkt data, sockets, SQL or Perl,,,

Strategic orgro is a holy grail.

We all have to be discretionary, cautious in our positioning.
I spend lots of time blogg about this.
Despite the underwhelming results of my techBets and tsn, we must not give up.
Applicable to Singapore government too. 
We need to decide what tech to take up and what to put off.

For the last 15Y, finDev IV is my chose game.
The 3 types of dnlg are still relevant.
