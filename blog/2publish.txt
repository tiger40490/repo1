-- new: tag proliferation ^ too many on a post: which is worse
I feel tag proliferation is worse. Some tags would lose sunshine and lose relevance.

-- new: scale-out favored by the propaganda
The propaganda, the simplistic view favors scale-out. However, scale-out can underperform.

similarly, multithreaded qsort can be slower than single-threaded. 

The paper on COST (Configuration that Outperforms a Single Thread) asserts that 
The unoptimized implementation "scales" far better, despite (or rather, because of) its inferior performance. 

The COST of a given platform for a given problem is the count of cpu cores required before the platform outperforms an optimized single-threaded implementation.

The COST can be hundreds of cores. A given scale-out platform may require that many cores to beat a single-threaded implmenetation. If you grow an army of shrimps against a whale in a tug-of-war, you need an army of millions.
