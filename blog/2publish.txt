--update blogpost on survivor
I more than survived at Macq in first year, with a bonus
I did survive at Stirt by recovering from PIP and earning a meet/meet

My sampling technique was biased, statistically. I didn't count the number of times I survived layoff:
* GS during GFC
* OC through the transfer
* Stirt through the meet/meet
* Macq through the transfer

My perception of each entire period was tainted -- "once I got a PIP, all subsequent positive evidence is negligible."
