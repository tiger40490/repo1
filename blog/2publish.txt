-- update g5 shields https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=20372&action=edit
In this blogpost I will use other metaphors besides "shield". Pillar and levee have unique connotations. 

MLP job is the most fragile of all pillars supporting my carefree ezlife 

SG citizenship is a stronger pillar. Its vulnerabilities are well-understood.
My conserver lifestyle is arguably the strongest pillar.
My wellness
my strong family is an under-appreciated pillar and shield, esp. for the kids. 

-- slow-cooking update post on Jiang.Zhu
Jiang.Zhu is an unknown LeadEngineer figure that I last met in 1991. Both him and the Fenix CTO are largely unknown personalities, so my mental pictures of them are imagined/fabricated content fitted onto a half-skeleton.
I guess in both of them, there is still a lot of untapped potential, a lot of drive, ambition. Compared to them, I probably look "lazy", but how about zqbx?

Similarly to my "laziness", my son may look lazy. In contrast, at age 13 I was more disciplined, more motivated, more ambitious than him. 

Lazy or not, at my age whenever I look out towards the deathbed I feel those "things" are unimportant.
Consider JackZ and Raymond's situations. At my age and economic level, what endeavors are really strategic?
1) wellness lifestyle improvements like yoga, sustainable diet habits, BMI
2) dev-till-70 accu, plowback,,, including QQ and CIV
? academic parenting? No. I prioritize motivation, bonding, coaching, self-discipline
? prepare for relocation to U.S. including car ownership, burn rate control
