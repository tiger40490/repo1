Some sectors have deep pockets but somewhat unattractive, unglamorous among SWEs, so those SWE with such a domain experience tend to command a salary premium.

Oil-n-gas is one example
Hedge fund .. perceived as unstable
Finance in genneral .. perceived as backward and laggard
government .. is NOT

In a "normal" job, I would feel that "mainstream tech/dnlg" as a factor is like 15% vs 25% for salary+benefits

Our judgement of morality, character... etc is subject to brainwash.

We need to read the criticisms, counter arguments, both sides of the story.

-- update progressive lens
I don't want to waste my (reusable) frames even though Cigna pays everything. It's a waste of resources, and also indirectly raises insurance premium.

-- update bpost on HRBlock mental block
Meaningfully Reward myself for starting the process earlier in the year. The earlier the better.

-- update ITC which one?
Inter-thread-communication can use an atomic var. Usually a very simple type like bool or short integer.

EffectiveModernC++ has an example.

AtomicRef is a wrapper over a pointer that supports CAS?

(lambda : ...) syntax is always more flexible, more explicit

-- new or update bpost on quality time.. Every family outing must count
Almost everyone involved is busy and each has to make adjustments to make it happen.

For years, I resented the huge hours lost after a movie -- time spent shopping or at nearby playgrounds. I realized that after a family movie, I should go straight home.
Then in 2022 I slowly changed my behavior. After a Stadium trip, we spent hours in Decathlon. 
Around Christomas 2022, we went to IMM to buy a pair of shoes but spent 5 - 8 hours there ! Still regretful but less painful.

13 Nov family outing trip was very low productivity, "rot". 
Somehow I avoided the burn-rot trap of self-hate. 
I used to be a hostage. The high standad of productivity was simply unrealistic with family outing. 

In contrast, I think a corporate team-building event could be (would be) benchmarked for efficiency, but that's for the organizer. 
Most participants would be too relaxed and fail the benchmark. 
Family members are more like the participants rather than the organizers.
