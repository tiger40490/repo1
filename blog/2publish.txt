--new blogpost: frq@stretching
try to stretch for 10 min on the body part you last used
aim for 2-3 such stretches a week. 
If you can't then I would say aim for 2 minutes twice a week.

--new blogpost: less is more
calorie restriction means reduce starch, fried or creamy food. Most of the delicious foods are now reduced to my tolerable limit, without depriving myself.

Less is more. More health, more vitality, more confidence, more self-esteem. 

However, the self-esteem should NOT be based on false beliefs and brainwash/propaganda.
