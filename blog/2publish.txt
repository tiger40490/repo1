--new jolt: Deepak on daily exercise
This analysis is based on 5 min of chat
Deepak said compared to diet, exercise is relatively easy becasue he can do some exericse everyday. My perception of him affects my perception of my son. I tend to dismiss Deepak's claim on exercise. Perhaps he was doing relatively light exercise, perhaps for 30min+ each day for a few months. Reality is...
* Very few individuals (perhaps 1~3%) can achieve that.
* perhaps grandpa, with his strong self-mangement, could achieve something slightly higher at age 40. I'm not better than Deepak. I couldn't do 30min every day.
* even if his effort is not maintained for multiple years, there's a health benefit for the overweight individual, in terms of weight + various organs

jolt
--new: writing to map 
put_If_Absent: java uses putIfAbsent(); c++ uses insert()
insert_Or_Update (most common map "Writing"): java uses put(); c++ uses operator[]. 
update_If_Existing: c++ needs if-block; java uses replace() which returns null if nothing replaced; 

Note computeIfAbsent() is kinda more efficient than putIfAbsent which unconditionally computes the new "value" even though there's a 50/50 chance it is unneeded -- i.e. the incumbent scenario.

--new: data center ^ cloud@@

Q: does data center rack space always mean some form of cloud?

Q: if not, then what's the difference between a regular data center and a cloud?

Two major sectors:
* financial companies -- generally use private data centers, probably not cloud. The grid/farm could offer elasticity i.e. compute nodes enlisted on demand, but I don't know if (docker) containers are created on the fly.
* web sites -- often uses the cloud, but not necessarily the elastic cloud

The other sectors are unfamiliar to me.

So whenever I hear people talk about cloud or grid, I would enquire about container
