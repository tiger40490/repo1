My phone contacts are often slow to load. I suspect they are saved in google cloud.


-- update bpost on 'resotre'
My recent depression is about coping (and making peace) with aging. 

My aging is kind of gathering pace, and I think it will accelerate. Gradually I will lose physical and some mental capacities. 
I will adjust to it, even though adjustment can be stressful, painful, frustrating,,,

-- new: Hui Mei consultation#2
she recommends joint mgmt with psychologist.
No hurry though.

holiday feast .. soup first;  minimize starch otherwise; limit cakes to 6 pieces/meal (assuming regular size).
I was reluctant to set target, but now I like the idea.

fasting .. I described to her milk + fruits for entire day. If below 400cal/24H, then safe to practice twice a week. My fasting is 600cal+, so no safety concern.

After age 60, can aim for BMI=25, and maintain muscle mass.
Current BMI 21.x is very good for my age.

Going back to 63 kg .. probably not something to aim at.

Why I was able to achieve 65.5 kg .. awareness; conscious self-control.

perhaps it would be more effective to develop some Deep hobbies early in life, such as writing, playing pop songs, yoga, painting,
It requires strategic planning and heavy investment

Starhub port-in issues ... rather than bitterness I could and should feel grateful and lucky to get the answers from the PlazaSing staff.

1 Oct 1am HSBC FAST down time .. instead of disappointment, I should feel lucky to hear the clear answer about 1-7.30am. Also, I was lucky to hear a complete answer from the SCB lady, and lucky to avoid any SCB lock-out.

-- update or new: threading in c++ less popular than in java
Concurrency dev is difficult, in both design and the basic building blocks as language constructs. Java makes it easier, much easier than pthreads and std::thread. It is so easy that java interviews routinely include some concurrency questions.

Factor: the c++ shops I try are all trading shops. They choose c++ for latency. To optimize latency, STM is best, rather than multi-threading. So I think their c++ threading questions are light.

-- update [18]proof-of-work ] blockchain
Proof@Stake
Q: what if a big "shareholder" of a ABC coin mishandles a validation, and adds a bad block to the ABC blockchain? 

Does she earn the "gas" before or after the bad data is uncovered?  If "after", then bad data is included in the ABC block chain for at least some time, and during that period, unlimited number of subsequent blocks could go into the blockchain, leading to a mess. So I will assume answer is "before". 

So technically, how can the "second validation" take place in real time? If it is straightforward to detect a bad block, then the first validator would always do it automatically, and there would be no risk of losing your stake. In such a case, every participant would stake 100% of their coins each time. That means the biggest "shareholder" would keep getting richer, and richer.

I believe it's not straightforward to detect a bad block produced by the first validator. That leads to a can of worms.

Suppose there's a dispute... someone disputes a past transaction on the blockchain. Who has authority to question the first validator? Who would be the judge? I think real power ultimately lies with the founders and the software developers. This is not decentralized concensus-building.

-- new or update: detect stuck thread in a pool
weblogic marks a pooled thread as stuck if it is busy for 10min (configurable). Weblogic is designed for a large patient queue, so each patient should not take 10min.
Purpose of detection is not per-patient intervention. Purpose is hospital mgmt such as thread pool config, memory increase, or load balancing.

For a custom application, this doesn't work. A thread can be busy and productive for any amount of time.

I think wife's need is more critical. In contrast, I have a support network already.
