Before traveling, better ask tech support how to set up data roaming + local assistance

--update incomeShield
Across Singapore, shield Riders covering 100% of deductible + coinsurance are no longer available to new buyers, but existing policies are unaffected. Plus rider annual premium would likely grow.

Even if we were accepted by Aviva, it won't offer 100% coverage and will not stop being free after he turns 18. 

Daily cash rider is worth keeping until we leave SG. No question.

•	Notepad++ and ascii files, instead of RTF 
•	Standard diff tools
•	VIM, available in git-bash !
