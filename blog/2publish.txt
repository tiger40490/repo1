eg: An RTS suport manager (white American) told me many Americans choose to earn a degree in their 30's. 
This route is similar to the very common "returning" Master's student who have worked for a few years to gain some firsthand experience of the working world. 
I think these "older" students often come in with motivation, rather than forced to study as my son is now. 
Not every student is suitable for a nonstop flight secondary->preU->undergrad->Master's 

-- update : ffree ^ envy+FOMO
Other people's envy is the damper of my bare-bones ffree.
If we don't compare to the (wrong) peer group we CAN actually feel pretty comfortable and carefree, basking in a glowing self-esteem. 
So why do we compare?

On one hand, minimum acceptable food[1] cost is dropping globally, and I have way more than enough income to survive. 
On the other hand I feel lousy seeing some so-called "peers" earning 20 times more than that minimum, and twice my salary.
Each of them seems to complain about cost of living.

Q: what income is enough ? Philip Che said $5k for a family of 4. Wife said 4-5k for my family of 4. See worldbank^wife

I'm confronting the paradox of my adulthood. In pursuit of a rational perception, I have a chance to find and restore some balance in my world view.

I feel Theordore Rubin's books shed some light. He introduced some good descriptors.
