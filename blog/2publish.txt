-- new: 6-char PNR
A.k.a RecordLocator

If your flights involve different airlines, there are often separate PNRs for each carrier.

PNR is generated by the airline’s computer system, not by the travel agent.

Two airlines can generate the same PNR of 123ABC with no risk of confusion.

PNRs may not be recycled within 24 months.

-- new: "good"fatty foods
when people say avocado, nuts, salmon...are good for slimming, and backed by research, they mean "better than the mainstream junk foods".

If you are already on healthy diet, then these foods could be LESS healthy than your current diet!

-- update bpost on 5/wk
Q: Regarding my active-day defninitions, how long (years) will they stay relevant?
A: I choose to be optmistic and believe in myself, so 5Y at least.

-- new: effortphysical measurement to qualify for active days
I want to rationalize and refine my definitions.
Two ways to measure aggregate amount of daily workout -- 1) measurement 2) effort

Effort implies self-regulation, combatting the (natural) tendency to quit. Instructor-led classes always help easy self-regulation.

Physical measurement ignores self-regulation or any mental exertion. It is based on measurable output by muscles, cardio, perspiration, heartbeat,,, 

eg: Hatha or yin Yoga is low physical but huge effort
eg: Adding up (vertically) stairs/day .. is high physical, lower effort. In contrast, continuous climbing is higher effort.
eg: Jogging is high physical, lower effort 
eg: Rope-skipp is very boring, therefore high effort lower physical

"Low effort" is relative and never means easy. Keeping up active days, hitting 3 active days a week for a month is absolutely demanding and never easy, regardlessof the workout.

my 5/wk routine is the /exemplification/ of successZ, and really tough except during a few weeks when I'm motivated and confident. (However, such a power surge "honeymoon" rarely lasts a month.)

Most adults (like 98%) after leaving school/army and before retirement would find it really tough. (Servicemen and Pre-college students are different because they have physical training + fitness tests.)
In their views, which type of workout of this bpost is most frequently questioned as too light? 
A: skiprope, squat... but "their view" is based on popular perception only.

In my own view which workout is most frequently questioned as too light?
A: skiprope, stairs

Frequency is the key and also the real challenge. To maintain frequency, I increase variety, and incorporate incentives.

-- update curiositySou
celebrity news .. we don't need to search. The important news would find its way to me.

case study: when I researched on "richest country of latam", I was drawn into the different ways to measure national wealth. Unplanned. Energy sink !

-- update germany universities ranking
I believe that German system doesn't try to allocate resources to one top university to increase its international ranking. German universities are reported "much more uniform". This means that if you only look at the very top, you will see a few US universities but not a single German one. At the same time any German university would count as fairly good compared to the average US university.

If you want a university that scores in the top 10 internationally, a necessary but insufficient condition is an amount of funding similar to the current top 10. No German university is anywhere close to that amount of money and the German government, which provides the bulk of their funding, is (currently) not interested in giving out that amount of funding to a single university. 

I think funding is a necessary condition in many science domains + econs

-- new: Japanese diet advantage: small portions
Doctor Lynne Lim pointed out that Japanese diet features many small dishes. She said those small portions are important. 

When asked about "challenges posed by modern life", she again mentioned meal portion control as a challenge of modern life. She compared us to pre-modern (I would say pre-industriizlied) people -- "They gardened, farmed, walked to reach places, ate simply, reveled in communal gatherings, laughed and slept easy." 

Among those items, the last one "slept easy" strikes me as the most enviable. 

I would say easy sleep is not a complete test but an acid test of healthy lifestyle.

My father is full of wisdom, but is weak on this front. Dr Lim herself is also coping with occasional sleep issues, and she repeatedly emphasized sleep , as an element of physical and mental health in modern life.

In the same interview, she also pointed out Sweedish healthy diet features low-carbs

-- new or update: gmail disk hogs
gmail -> search settings -> specify size, but leave other settings unchanged.

You should see "larger:5M" as the only searchString in the searchBox. This probably indicates no other filter.

You should then see many emails greating that size across the years.

WindowsApps folder -- not worth optimizing. Quite risky.

-- new: 2FA for financal sites
After Edwin told me about hacking, now I understand the need for 2FA.
U.S. ebanking sites don't use 2FA and therefore someone can steal my password and impersonate me !

High credit limit is another hazard.

-- new: hypothesis: BMI: Sg > U.S.
workout .. I suspect that my Sg workout is more than U.S. workout, in terms of calorie burned, and my Sg calorie intake is similar to U.S.

base metabolic rate .. Perhaps the base metabolic rate is lower in Sg, but I have no edvidence.

water weight .. Perhaps my body retains more water in Sg than in U.S.

We don't know the exact calorie numbers. It's possible that in SG the measurable calorie in my diet is similar to U.S., but the energy taken in by the body is higher.

-- update bpost chain@credibility: dating/bccy
university branding (and national academies, but to a lesser extent) lend credibility to their researhers

Nobel committee lends credibility to the laureats... most commonly in Econs and bio-medical domains.

major newspapers (and news agencies) lend credibility to their journalists.

-- update bpost on US taxes
Q: is it unlawful, unethical to put incorrect data on tax returns?
IRS is understaffed. Their fraud surveillance system is increasingly automated to reduce labor cost.

The ROI of the audit system has a numerator measured in tax dollars recovered. Therefore, if your taxable income is a small sum, then I doubt they would bother analyzing it. 

Similarly, when I set out to free up my gmail storage, I won't spend time on small disk hogs.

I contributed tax dollars during my 8Y stay, and won't receive any benefit in return. This is "The_system", unfair to H1B immigrants like me.

-- new: burden @carTCO after any burst@carefree-bubble
Private car TOC often takes on a new dimension when you find yourself on a cashflow low ground, or when your carefree-bubble bursts.
* when a family member is in long-term care
* when jobless
* when in bad weather .. emergency repairs costs more
* when we are physically challenged due to eyesight or disability. We might need taxi.
* when we are used to having two cars but then both cars give problems.
* when our driving privilege is suspended

Much better if we live in a well-connected location with public transport.

-- update "buy without oth"
Related to "merchandize return", another major tcost and stressor is keeping track of "stuff bought and disused long ago".

When I lose such an item (perhaps at home or discarded), and have to buy again, I feel an acute self-hate, but this self-hate goes against use-without-care

For example, I removed the red pedestal pair from my bike after boy stopped using them. I kept them at home for a few years and discarded them. Then my daughter needed them so I had to buy online. Actually I did all the right things so regret is not justified.

==== new kindness
I see myself as a kind person. Kindness is one of the G3 essential traits of a good person, a decent person, or a high-quality person. You want kind individuals in your team, in your family.

Each thinking person's yardstick of kindness is slightly different from the mainstream yardstick.

* kind to family .. Perhaps the most important element is .. kindness to family. 
* kind to self .. Missing element in many yardksticks is the Question -- Is the person kind to the self. Does she like herself?
* kind to coworkers .. Are you kind to your coworkers? Look at Larry vs deMunk 
* kind to customers .. For an employee in any people-facing job, I think it's easy to be kind to his customers/users, because he is trained, paid (and monitored) to do so. Negative feedback (complaints etc) on unkind gestures is prompt, recorded, and analyzed with plenty of guidance, so he will receive plenty of "support" to correct his behavior.
* kind to rivals, competitors, frenemies
* kind to friends .. the easiest kindness
* kind to strangers seeking help

恶有恶报 -- one of the most powerful "laws of the universe" is about kindness/unkindness.

-- morality .. more strict than kindness
A leader needs moral compass, so kindness is less important.

I'm also a good husband. Many otherwise kind man are unfaithful.

In some positions (such as law enforcement), kindness is probably less important than fairness.

As of 2019, the typical Black or Hispanic family has up to $2,000 in liquid savings, the typical White family has more than four times that amount.

-- update: seminar on DS/ML
hiring: DS + finance ... scarce
I think this means hiring team's criteria is too high, perhaps with non-trivial dnlg

Engineering is a huge effort in data science team. I think they need devops, or scripting SWE, rather than C++/java SWE. 
However, java SWE may lack know-how with certain packages.

I think BQuant is a huge investment in DS/ML/AI since 2007.
I think the two BQuant presentations represent the most commercially viable applications of BQuant DS/ML research. Both presentations offer emerging, tantatilizing value propositions. The absence of a more concrete value proposition suggests that AI/ML is still a solution looking for a problem. 

* NLP solution includes a sugar-coating UI to ease the usage of the Bloomberg terminal. The main value-add is an ingestion engine constantly analysing news articles and applying ML models to tag/index/classify content. Users can perform high-level sentiment analysis.

* intraday order-flow data analytics for pre-trade signal .. see https://btv-gz.dreamhosters.com/40285/ai-predicting-security-price-skeptical/

the Bloomberg API is mostly python, perhaps similar to PyTorch and TensorFlow.

~~ i feel these data scientists are not SWE.. seldom uses compiled language. They are users of a software platform.

java and c# are sometimes considered c/c++ applications. (In the same vein, c++ can be considered a C application since it is built on top of C.) I think this description ignores the fact that java / c# developers do need to worry about low-level details.

These data scientists. They use scripting languages and high level libraries. I think they might be similar to app developers using Angular.

They might be similar to quants who write c++ code.

However, a data science codebase can be large and complex, just not in the same way as a traditional compiled project.

However, traditional scientists don't write code. 

Does your skill as a c++/java/c# SWE make you a stronger candidate for a data science dev team, compared to a candidate coming from python, javascript, ruby etc? 
Yes but not much.

I see high churn in this domain.
