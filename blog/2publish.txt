Q: how long can I hold off returning to U.S.?
Q: if I get GC but stay outside U.S. for years what happens to my GC?

If in the mood for localSys, then don't go home to sleep. Sleep in office. Go home to eat then come back to office.

--update blogpost on survivor
I more than survived at Macq in first year, with a bonus
I did survive at Stirt by recovering from PIP and earning a meet/meet

My sampling technique was biased, statistically. I didn't count the number of times I survived layoff:
* GS during GFC
* OC through the transfer
* Stirt through the meet/meet
* Macq through the transfer

My perception of each entire period was tainted -- "once I got a PIP, all subsequent positive evidence is negligible."

--update blogpost on musicians and doctors.
When we watch a movie from Europe, India, Korea ... we can tell whether it has any international appeal or only limited local audience.

Similarly localSys knowledge has value only within a single company. The expertise I demonstrate in job interviews are relevant across many sites.

Even though Indeed hiring team claims to be language agnostic and don't care about your app domain, their architecture questions are geared towards web2.0 shops

There's a thinly veiled leaning towards java. 
If you use another language for your whiteboard, then you had better be very fast and sharp to defend your solution when it differs from the optimal java solution.

In reality, the solution you get using another language CAN be different from the optimal java solution.

--new Q: in graph DFT and BFT, do we need a "seen" hashtable to remember visited nodes? 
A: I probably needed it in some of my coding problem
A: 
I think so. The textbook DFT/BFT algos use white/grey/black for this purpose. It's basically a hashtable { node addr -> color } esp. if nodes are readonly.

This color technique is not needed for a simple binary tree, but it can become useful in tough CIV

--New blogpost: many things]python can have attributes 
Those "things" can be a module, a function, a class, an instance of a class

An attribute can be a data item or a method.

I feel attributes are related to namespaces, meta-programming and reflection.

increase spend on good mobile data and mobile devices to capture the creativity ...
increase spend on printer
increase spend on hotel stay near office (or taxi home) to capture the engagement on localSys
spend on flights to gain family time, engaged 
spend unpaid leave to attend interviews .. to gain joy, motivation, engagement, precious insight into their selection priority
Regrettable spent unpaid leave before starting Macq job .. to gain peaceful family time? low ROI
questionable spend (gave up higher pay rate) to gain ... c++ skills like QQ, GTD, zbs
