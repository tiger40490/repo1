-- new: excess mortality
I used to question PAP government's mid-2021 decision to open up during Delta wave. I questioned the human cost in terms of deaths.

The Aha moment came when I realized excess mortality in SG was zero. 

The livelihood cost of zero-covid is not easily measurable. This cost includes hardship, long-term damage to SG economy, mental health.. But for the same argument, let's say it is comparable to 987 deaths a year.

What if SG maintains zero-covid and avoids those deaths, but the total death count over a year remains the same as before covid (around 24,000)?

It means those 987 covid deaths avoided were offset by about the same number of deaths by other causes, dealths that inevitably occur even in an airtight bubble city with zero covid. 

It means the, in the grand scheme of things, the heavy price we pay in terms of livelihood buy us some but not all that much.

Note in a hospital overrun, then excess mortality would be significant.

-- new: "move"%%rEstate portfolio to SG in my twilight years
I have always agreed to the prudent advice that as we age, our risk appetite drops and we should rationalize/adjust our rEstate portfolio to less risky countries. Every country has risk factors, but SG remains the least risky.

We grow wiser via adversities + reflections [including expressive writing]. Without reflections, the growth is slower. We may even forget the details of the adversity and fail to learn from it.

blogg can stretch your child's IQ. One of the best single measures of overall intelligence as measured by intelligence tests is vocabulary.
Writing has critical connections to speaking. I need more improvement in speaking than writing.
[d] Blogg increases chance of achiving personal goals... 
[d] Emotional intelligence (both self and inter-personal). Even without sending out my writing, whenever I write down another person's perspective, I get a better understanding.
[d] Blogg can spark your creativity, esp. when facing a tough challenge that requires creative problem solving.
[d] Blogg can enhance self-esteem and self-confidence. Reflections on positive experiences can build a catalog of personal achievements that you continue to go back to. Indeed I revisit my positive experiences via blogg. I also blog about negative experience for learning and coping.

-- new: trainers targeting greed
Patrick of Gex Academy
Adam.Khoo
Ewin.Chia
Pauline.Teo
Many of the youtube advertizers

This is a sample of the trainers in Singapore.

I feel the biggest weakness in their proposition is endless greed -- exclub/FOMO. That is a poisonous ingredient in their recipe. These trainers seem to /prey/ on this common human weankess. They never preach successE/successL, seldom successZ. 

Many of these trainers are overweight, have imperefect diet/workout habits. Despite their financial status, I don't think they have successE. They are working too hard, enslaved by their greed.

I suspect that many of them have below-average quality of marriage.

Beside their financial success (ignoring the dangerous leverage they take on) they have nothing to impress me. Not role models at all.

-- update: pw recovery questions
the most tricky is 'your employer'. Just tell them "I change job every year. Please ask another question."

Another tricky question is "how many ATM cards". Just tell them "I use only 2 ATM cards".

The hotline will not remove the question even if they understand me.

I think this frustration is similar to having strange names (Kranti?), non-permanent addresses, multiple email addresses.

in the late 2000s, my mom said CNY 400k was a good-enough medical reserve for each retiree, on top of public health insurance (reimbursement-based). Such insurance has coinsurance, and numerous exclusions such as elective treatments [imported medication, supplements,,]. 

In early 2022 my dad recalled that consensus figure among retirees of that time -- regardless of the medical condition, if CNY 500k is spent over and on top of insurance, and still the life can't be saved, then it's reasonable to give up. As such CNY 500k was a reasonable last-resort personal medical reserve, for millions of well-informed Chinese retirees.

Fast forward to 2022, CNY 500k-1000k of family savings is common according to my dad, living in Beijing. I think this improvement in savings reflects (medical++) inflation, rising income, rising wealth esp. in rEstate.

Traction secret to better intimacy: cardio workout

AMB looks so daunting but someday I Will find a traction/vision secret

Re my mail to Edmund, most retail investors have not found a vision secrets like mine.

-- new: hotlines in U.S.
category: retire where

Rude awakening in early 2007: Government services were often very poor. Hit numerous immigration problems. ID issuance was slow. DMV had huge queues. Post office had shorter lines but inadequate hotlines.

Government Hotlines are overloaded...

Many government services are self-service, either online or by write-in [still common as of 2007]. Many complicated procedures with pages of instructions to read. Often you must ask friends + self-teach. Still you can hit roadblocks that require commercial, professional assistance.Â Sometimes there was a visible effort to simplify (or explain) the process for new users. I would say far from effective. In contrast, Singapore goverment services come with plenty of hotline staff (occasionally community centers too) .. adequate staffing !

Semi-government, non-profit services are similar. Hospitals, utilities, schools, credit bureaus, airports, transport authorities, police, legal systems, IRS,,,

Some big private [i.e. for-profit] service providers have adequate customer support, often tiered based on your account tier! I noticed it in GS, Verizon, ... So if you don't have enough in-house expertise, then you need to pay a premium.

In 2007, I couldn't afford to pay the premium :(

Alternatively, smaller service providers offer better customer support.

My stocks could be overvalued, but I don't bother to babysit them. The tcost and stress of babysitt is too high. My firewall would break, and the volatility would /boil over/.

I do need to reduce my positions in low-yield and unproven stocks. They are at higher risk of getting overvalued.
