--update blogpost on wbank:
looking at Rahul, P.Mullins etc -- Capable professionals, but that level of minimum burn rate creates a permanent burden on their shoulders. 

I think the value-investing seminar target audience also feel a similiar burden -- How the hell can I sustain my BASIC $2k/head family lifestyle if I don't want to work so hard for 30Y and then sustain the same lifestyle beyond retirement? Their problem is really the burn rate.

Instead of 2k/head, Aaron of DBS said 10k/M nonwork income would be comfortable for financial freedom.

In terms of burn rate, I'm blessed with a frugal wife, SG citizenship ..

-- update blogpost on conducive learning environment
biggest item in my checklist for that environment is peer influence. 

I feel north (or south) Edison might be pretty good. 

Bayonne and JC feel all right.

--new:U.S.drug culture: G5 specific strategies
(unranked)
* choose strict schools. Pay the price.
* Choose Chinese neighbourhood like Edison. Accept the long commute
* join a class as an older student
* protect the bond with kids, so they open up to me when needed.
* wife stay home to keep an eye on him for a while.  During the formative years, mother has more influence than father. (If he needs constant monitoring, then consider SG.)
* focus on what we can control; recognize and accept the things beyond our control.

#1 Biggest strategy -- parachute. When needed, be decisive to relocate back to SG. 
I would then have no doubt that I need to work in SG for several years, perhaps at lower salary.
Accept that both kids could be delayed by a year or two, or consider international schools.
Philosophically, Even though every decision has consequences, we are not permanently locked into the emmigration decisions. 

--new: luxury edu: unaffordable for lower middle class
jolt

In the U.S context, medical school is for the upper class. Similarly, top schools (in all countries), top colleges, private tuition, enrichment programs... can be considered as luxuries that lower middle class (like me) can't afford easily. 
I would have to struggle, sacrifice, endure a lot to afford them.

My barebones ffree is insufficient for this level of luxury.

Before college phase, I think luxury education could be 70% of the total budget. This luxury alone can derail my carefree life.

Similar experience -- the prospect of a 700k home (with property tax + mortgage) became a threat to my cashflow carefree /position/, until I devised the lease-spread idea/plan. 

--new: G3 damages@lockdown@%%life
1) bonding with boy -- I had more frustrations, and more bursts of temper
2) loss of quiet hours for reflective blogging and self care, but now I think I can go to MRT
3) diet and BMI loss of control
no family outing
sleep -- my late hours often lead to poor sleep the next morning
yoga
standing desk usage 

.. Some of the unexpected triumphs:
More positive perception of wife's parenting practices
jogging 
repaired many things at home
wrong-time temptation at home meal time

The focus on the word "protection" is likely to uncover some threats I perceive consciously or subconsciouly.
[c] SG citizenship -- protects against healthcare inflation, long-term nursing co, housing cost, general inflation. Some protective benfits of SG citizenship are not measured by money -- 
* protection against poor service (common in many countries) when I'm in need of help
* protective environment for up-bringing of kids -- drug-free,,
* SG government has a large past reserve to protect Singapore against many threats.
[c] good burn rate as family -- protects against many cashflow threats. 
[c] bx plans
sound education for kids -- protects against parents' worries
[w] good sleep -- protects against workload, ,,,
[w] good diet
[w] bmi greenzone
stable marriage -- is a cornerstone and protects against many threats
harmony at home
[j] WallSt contract job market -- protects against early decline of demand
[j] IV competitiveness including theoretical skills
[j] English skill -- protects against job market competition from overseas newcomers 

[j=threat of job loss or job pain]
[c=cashflow stress or distress]
[w=welness protections]

-- update blogpost on distraction
Robinhood proved very distractive. It became substance addiction similar to the wrong-time temptation

--new: income eq-funds: my take
I feel most of the big fund houses probably avoid the high-yield, high-risk stocks such as U.S. REITs.

I guess for them, 4% div is considered high. I assume the fund dividend payout comes strictly from stock dividend, not position liquidation. Therefore, a typical “high-income” equity fund can only pay 5% average. In reality it could swing between 3% and 7%

--update blogpost on canada: 
The names of many U.S. cities conjure up romatic images in my head, but to visit or retire there, main factor is 1) cost and 2) climate, 3) Chinese community

Therefore, I should consider Penang, Jiande only

--new: ice-cream: buy expensive popsicles
Some ice cream popsicles are tiny and expensive. 
When we buy this product (rather than the big tub), we are "persuaded" to eat less ice-cream each time, and more slowly. Without the popsicle packaging, I would probably eat 5 times in one sitting.

--new: BMI L@ctrl: self-care^self-hate
a big part of my cabin fever is diet loss@control, esp. the wrong-time temptation.

I'm used to be in control, so the loss of control is devastating, degenerative and destructive.

self-hate, unreasonable expectation are part of the underlying.

What we need is compassion and self-care. In my preoccuation with BMI, I fail to recognize and celebrate the huge effort and success in
* avoid family meal when not hungry
* starch
* fat
* raw veg + fruits
* chia seeds

Pehraps my diet is not lost, but BMI battle is in decline. If that's the case then we need the bao3shan1 strategy.

Perhaps the increased calorie intake (presumably due to starch and fat) is directly due to coping with stress

Perhaps what I need is intermittent fasting or warrior diet. Go without starch/fat for 16H everyday.

--new: live free of restrictions
I can live with the restrictions of diet, burn rate... but not LiuShuo style self-restraint in office context.

I feel the suffering is not worthwhile.

I don't feel self-confident I can "improve" myself.
