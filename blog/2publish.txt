however strong you are in a dev team, there are tasks to "reveal" your relative weaknesses, unless you are stronger than average on all fronts

beside Melvein3, the middle class Chinese parents tend to spend half their disposable incomes on education... a bottomless hole.

Note disposable income is money remaining after paying all the bills + mortgage + gas

--new: precious
shops are precious only in primte retail locations. Consider shops in industrial parks.

Office units are precious only in prime commercial locations. Consider offices in Orchard.

Residential can be precious in elite locations such as top school districts.

--new: residential pros and cons
:) faster to sell because more investors are familiar with the asset class
:) faster appreciation due to hot money, _but_ less stable
:( More of a commodity, not as precious as prime location shop units.
:( NRY lower, despite what marketers say. 
:( higher risk of buying overpriced

One of my G5 show-stoppers is moving content intra or inter.

--jolt: PIP^jobloss fear
For me, job loss is a lighter stressor than PIP fear. 

In fact, I don't worry about end of contract and benchtime. I worry more about humiliating bonus.

I'd rather lose a job than receiving a salary on PIP.

Most friends assume that my PIP fear was fundamentally related to cashflow worry, but I am confident about job hunting. So my PIP fear is all about ego and unrelated to cashflow.

-- update blogpost on 12M delay
eg: An RTS suport manager, a white American, told me a sizeable percentage Americans choose to earn a degree in their 30's. (My NUS class age profile is not too different, with up to 10% in the late 20's.)
This route is similar to the very common "returning" Master's student who have worked for a few years to gain some firsthand experience of the working world. 
In my MSFM, about 30% of the students were experienced.
I think these "older" students often come in with higher motivation, rather than forced to study as my son is now. 

Not every student is suitable for a nonstop flight secondary->preU->undergrad->Master's 

* If I lose this nice job then emmigration would be the default route. 
* If boy does poorly in secondary school he would not attend poly or JC but serve NS first (I could then work in U.S. alone). 
* If he finds motivation before 16, then we can choose to emmigrate or complete JC.

--new: comparing 3 major stressors
* PIP
* FOMO including brank envy 
* burn rate stress including jobloss fear

jolt: FSM div never delivered the destressor as /envisioned/.
In contrast, my GRR has produced /substantial/ nonwork income, but still insufficient to counter the threat of PIP !

Jobloss stressor is alleviated by this income, fairly effectively!

Excluding the unlucky families, I feel most "ordinary" people's stress primarily come from burn rate i.e. making ends meet, including jobloss fear
I feel the middle class families around me could survive at a much lower burn rate of SGD 3.5-4.5k (or USD 6k -- no 1st-hand experience) but they choose the rat race of keeping up with the Joneses (FOMO). Therefore, their burn rate becomes 6k or 15k. 

For some, FOMO takes them to the next level -- benchmarking against the high-flyers. 

For the middle class, any burn rate exceeding 3k is a stressor because the working adults now need to keep a job and build up a layoff contingency reserve.

With a full time job, workers experience a full spectrum of stressors including PIP.
