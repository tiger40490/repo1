* They waste numerous small amounts of money on a monthly basis. Over decades they "throw down the drain" a painful portion (like 10-20%) of their income.
* Large number of small time-wastage is similar. Some of us feel the pain only years later when our peers make progress in their spare time (or their office hours).
* calorie-quota overconsumption is cbtz. calorie-quota is a similar concept to carbon-quota. Each country each year is given a quota. If you over use bit by bit, then someday you need to borrow from the future quota.

Among these scarce resources, usable time is the most scarce, available up to age 60 (only 55 for some).

This is a talent and a visible advantage. Among these talents, the most significant (used to be $) is calorie-quota budgeting. It has long-term health benefits.

Among these endeavors, my success is most visible and decisive in $$, and least in time-saving

This is one reason for my carefree life at this age when my peers endure stress. This (and other) freedom comes with responsibility.
