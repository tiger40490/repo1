--new: clarity@thinking=non-trivial strength

clarity of thinking is a non-trivial strength in me. Many friends say I'm very reflective and demonstrate Grade-A self knowledge and self analysis. 

I feel many "peers" don't show clarity of thinking. My sis, dad show clarity.

Vocab is a top-4 factor but can help a lot, esp. when a common phrase is ambiguous and confusing. To my surprise, many clear thinkers seem to use a small vocab.

I explain my content very clearly to myself, not always so clearly to "them". In my view , clarity of thought is mostly a self-management skill, so I don't worry about "them".

Brevity is perhaps a top 5 clarity factor. I tend to be good in brevity of writing. Some verbal-type individuals show exceptional clarity. Genn?

My use of spreadsheet is a visual sign of clarity
