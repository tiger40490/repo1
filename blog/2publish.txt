-- new or update bpost on quality time.. Every family outing must count
Almost everyone involved is busy and each has to make adjustments to make it happen.

For years, I resented the huge hours lost after a movie -- time spent shopping or at nearby playgrounds. I realized that after a family movie, I should go straight home.
Then in 2022 I slowly changed my behavior. After a Stadium trip, we spent hours in Decathlon. 
Around Christomas 2022, we went to IMM to buy a pair of shoes but spent 5 - 8 hours there ! Still regretful but less painful.

13 Nov family outing trip was very low productivity, "rot". 
Somehow I avoided the burn-rot trap of self-hate. 
I used to be a hostage. The high standad of productivity was simply unrealistic with family outing. 

In contrast, I think a corporate team-building event could be (would be) benchmarked for efficiency, but that's for the organizer. 
Most participants would be too relaxed and fail the benchmark. 
Family members are more like the participants rather than the organizers.

-- LG2 update which recrec bpost? bpost on speed coding or NBA?
Street dance skill can't make money for you.
Singing is similar.
Piano is similar but .... can teach... There's a robust demand in many cities.

basketball talent .. Top 0.1% can make money

Speed coding is very different. Many companies are interested to hire you.

-- new: career insecurity: 2017 watershed #marathon
t_vague
2017 marked a watershed in my perception of career insecurity.
Before the watershed, I had a "learned insecurity", instilled in me due to decades of brainwash, and internalized.

tech churn .. defeating any attempt of accumulation
The widespread and entrenched notion that "Few can remain hands-on till 40."
threat from younger or stronger competitors.
DRam refresh .. and maintain your critical mass
strengthen your moat, maintain your lead 
Don't drop out from the leading pack.
slow income growth outpaced by long-term (CPIx) inflation not only in home prices.

I felt like a (less successful version of) EDB -- can't afford to slow down, because of the constant risk of getting outrun/outmaneuvered, or caught up... The risk of losing our relevance.

After the watershed, I could see the end of my IN-voluntary marathon. Now am planning my own light marathon driven by successZ. 
This marathon could take me all the way to 70s. 
I hope to enjoy it.
Therefore, for the remainder of the marathon I could afford to slow down to a stroll, drop out of the leading pakc, and let other people overtake me, as happend in Toa Payoh stadium jogging track.

I told SY.C that my 100k/Y dev-till70 is not passive acceptance and failureZ, because I still make an effort -- a light maratho is still a marathon.



-- new: background heat: car ownership considered harmful
Trigger: Singapore consumer education promotes public transport, walk, cycle, rather than private cars.

The (mental) wellness factor, and to a lesser extent the eco factor, are background heat (a home-grown term not laden with meanings).

Some frequent drivers (7+ trips/wk) may pass all health screenings. If you are one of them, you may not care about the backgroune heat. 
You may feel your "system" can cope with the background heat.
However, over decades these factors tend to grow /heavier/, less negligible, and accmulate an enduring (positive/negative) effect on a person's life chances and well-being.

-- new: triple trip2fetch phone left@home: +ve perception
Today I left my mobile phone at home, so I came to office and quickly decided to go back and fetch it. 
A few years ago in the same situation, I used to feel bitter/resentful because I focused on the negative side:
* family members unable to help me... no obligation
* I would have to pay a few dollars for commute 
* I have just arrived in office and have not done any work
* I must return to office (rather than working from home) due to a meeting [PMA walk through]
* I will miss a 3pm meeting, though I could try to dial in during my commute

Just 2 or 3 items were enough to paint the whole thing bloody. Instead, this time I focused on the positive elements:
* my workload is low, without urgent deliverables
* my work hours are flexible
* my commute is rather short, with minimal walk on both ends
* I could read on the train, with a seat (offpeak hours)

This is a simple and powerful illustration of positive perception.
