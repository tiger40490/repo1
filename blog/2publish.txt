-- tell boy: slam on laptop lid ... not my laptop, but family's laptop.
what penalty?

-- new: G3 envies
nowadays, what visible signs of "higher ground" do I envy most? BMI and other basis of healthy longevity!

fitness? Not as important as BMI in terms of longevity
healthcare? 
height? A key advantage in marriage market but I'm not on that market. Short people can have better health
branded college? ditto
beautiful wife? Not so important at my age. This was the most potent trigger for envy
nonwork income? this is more potent than brank and salary, but I have basically sufficient.

--update  various blogopsts:
why I have two healthy kids? Largely due to the effective mother

--new jolt: biggest 反感: lazy
I told grandpa that my biggest frustration, 反感 (annoyance), anger ... is boy's laziness, i.e. poor motivation/effort.

Jolt: His effort level in the final months of P6 was visibly higher than p5 ... P5 was higher than P4. Remember P6 and even P5 was comparable to gaokao, often depicted as 200m.

Jolt: What if he scores well (like top of his class) using even less effort than this lazy level? I always maintain that "if you are competent then no need to work so hard"... an elastic yardstick ! 

Competence -- Looking into math competence, by Australian standard, boy could be quite competent, so perhaps he didn't need to work so hard?

I complained that his holiday time was decadant and wasteful, but what if he's top of his class? I would say he is brilliant/efficient and should broaden his scope ! 

Jolt: If I compare my level of effort to (the idealized image of) Rahul or DeepakCM, or some of those cramming/coding students, do I also deserve punishment? Looks like fundamentally, I'm still relying on benchmark performance to judge boy's effort.

Jolt: If I compare all of the above against the 70-mile runner, then who do Not deserve punishment?

In P6 he used to do his homework slowly till 11pm. I still rated him "lazy" because "inefficient". Waipo saw the same pattern and said congcong was impatient with homework and she might be right. My wife is like that.
I am similar to boy. I drag out my schedule and can be very inefficient even though I spent long hours "at work". But am I lazy at work? If I rate myself as inefficient/slow-pace but diligent, then so is my boy.

--new: worst unacceptable outcome@boy
.. is not benchmark disappointments including career progression
.. is not wellness condition
David's answer -- refusal to talk to parents
Grandpa's answer -- running away from home

My answer is -- effort. If he puts in effort but ends up with those results, I feel I would love him unconditionally. I recall XR's autistic son.

Teresa Teng was not a strong math student but worked hard at every subject.

Currently, despite his piano practice, his poor effort everyday is eroding the loving relationship. Unconditional love is under threat. Boy is very sensitive and can probably sense it.

Grandma notices the tension between two forces inside me. She drew this analogy -- imagine your sponse is diagnoised with cancer. You experience the huge pressure to take on the huge legwork and decide on treatment options for the spouse. At the same time, you may also feel the tendency to reject the cancer, and blame the cancer, but the cancel won't go away. Grandma said the 2nd, negative emotion is counterproductive. Yet it is real and common. 
I feel this is a good analogy. The cancer may be incurable. You still have a job to fight it and slow down its progression.

Remember Biden's love for his son, despite his drug problem. I would say he is still a successful father. Indeed a father would be successful if he did his best to stop the progression of such an addiction.

In the same blogpost, there's also a gay son's story. Is that an "effort" problem?

I'm no perfect child. If I have a son like me, is there something I can't accept? Theft!

My son has no aggression, no cruelty, no dishonesty,,,, that's why I find his laziness unacceptable.
