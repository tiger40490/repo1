--new: unexpected successes ROTI with boy #peter drucker:
NTUC trips
math sheet on his own
macRitchie
jogging in stadium

--new: consider SG American school
Perhaps the academic benchmark pressure is much lower in an American or international school.

--new: When setting up a new phone (laptop, and outlook are similar), i need to simplify it.
The more I rely on a device (laptop, linux, printer/scanner, camera..) the more I need to (invest time and) analyze my priorities and preferences.


--new (for wife): iphone explosion due to overcharge overnight
apple hotline told me that there is builtin protection for overheating.

If it's a genuine iphone without damage or tamper, then it won't explode. If it does, it's a defect. What we see on video footage could be fake. 

Before a phone explodes due to overcharge, there would be signs of unusual heating.

--new jolt: language new features=mostly4lib developers
In C++0x, Half of the major new language features are designed for the standard library developers.
The unspoken assumption -- these features are equally useful to other library developers.
The follow-up assumption -- app developers also need to use some (and understand all) of the nitty-gritty details.

In reality, these nitty-gritty details are not relevant to GTD for app developers.

--new: java give us no contorl over memory layout
No struct. (c# is better)
A string object (even as a field) is always a seperate heapy thingy

--new: a data API (for javascript consumers, python consumers, Excel consumers..) can include
smart search
subscription API like server push
streaming API
sorted collection API

--new: std::bitset: popular ] WallSt c++coding IV
std::bitset is popular in WallSt c++ coding interviews. Rather easy to use if you are an experienced c++ developer.

to_string() and cvctor from string like "011100101011010"
to_ulong() and cvctor from ulong
operator[] returns a reference, so you can assign to myBitset[0]. Designed to superfically mimic a raw array. Actually, return type is not reference to a bool. Rather, I think it's a reference to a specific posiiton in the "backing store". See http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/bitset/bitset/operator[]/

Avoid the notion of "left/right" -- Lowest bit has position 0, becasue bitset is designed to represent a binary integer. To scan from highest bit, we must iterate from bitset[size()-1] to bitset[0].

--new: exchange routing-out an order
When an order is sent directly to NYSE, NYSE could decide to route it to BATS-Y which fills it. I guess the fill report should probably show 30=BATY

liquidity indicator might show 3 (routed out)


--new: price discovery and closing auction
An exchange provides the (nearly) ideal venue for price discovery, but in reality the fragmentation of liquidity (eg: routing-out) makes price discovery non-trivial even on a large exchange like NYSE.

Luckily, the closing auction remains a centralized process. Even though a stock symbol can be traded on multiple exchanges beside the primary listing exchange, auction orders are always sent to the primary listing exchange.
