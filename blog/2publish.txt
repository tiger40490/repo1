-- LG2 update which one? bpost on speed coding or NBA?
Street dance ^ eGaming ^ speed coding
Street dance skill can't make money for you.
Singing is similar.
Piano is similar but .... can teach... There's a good demand.

basketball talent .. Top 0.1% can make money

Speed coding is very different. Many companies are interested to hire you.


-- update bpost on commute (which one?)
Need to balance 2 priorities (3 would be max)
logistical efficiency .. printed material (without need4writing) is far more efficient than git-blogg esp. for short trips or with transfers
productivity zsms .. laptop with coding or tech QQ, or tech books 

When is best time for git-blogg? Looks like an unwanted child. Commute is a good choice, even if not the very best.
When is best time for my growing recreational books? In office and home

-- slow-cooking new: career insecurity: 2017 watershed
t_vague
2017 marked a watershed in my perception of career insecurity.
Before the watershed, I had a learned insecurity, instilled in me due to decades of brainwash, and internalized.

tech churn .. defeating any attempt of accumulation
The widespread and entrenched notion that "Few can remain hands-on till 40."
threat from younger or stronger competitors.
DRam refresh .. and maintain your critical mass
strengthen your moat, maintain your lead 
Don't drop out from the leading pack.
slow income growth outpaced by long-term inflation not only in home prices.

I felt like the EDB -- can't afford to slow down, due to the risk of getting outrun/outmaneuvered, or caught up... The risk of losing our relevance.

After the watershed, I could see the end of my involuntary marathon. Now am planning my own light marathon driven by successZ. 
This marathon could take me all the way to 70s. 
I hope to enjoy it.
Therefore, for the remainder of the marathon I could afford to slow down to a stroll, drop out of the leading pakc, and let other people overtake me
as happend in Toa Payoh stadium.

I told SY.C that my 100k/Y dev-till70 is not passive acceptance and failureZ, because I still make an effort -- a light marathon.
