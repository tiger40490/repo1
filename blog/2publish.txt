Tower interviewer asked me to elaborate why I claimed java is a very clean language compared to c++ (and c#). I said clean means consistency and fewer rules

I gave the example of q[=]. In java, this is either content update (for primitive data types) or pointer reseat (for reference types). No ifs or buts.

In c++ q[=] can invoke the copy ctor, move ctor, copy assignment, move assignment, conversion ctor, conversion operator. Its meaning is somewhat special for a reference variable at site of initialization vs update. For (dereferenced) pointers variables, there are additional subtleties.
