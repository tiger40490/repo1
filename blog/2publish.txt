--Hi Catherine,
On 4 Oct, my friend Raymond Teo was not able to get my Key. Megaworld Admin said Friday 11 Oct would be available. 11 Oct my friend Chun Tih was again unable to receive the key.

After making full payment, I need the key ASAP.

I might check in and stay there for a few days soon. Before that, Chun Tih need to set up curtains and bedding and other basics.

--new blogpost: standard free tools
I favor free, standard tools because they are my only choice in some companies
•	VIM, available in git-bash !
•	Putty + screen
•	Git-bash
•	Notepad++ and ascii files in 'recoll', instead of RTF 
•	Standard diff tools
