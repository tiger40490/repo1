-- update blogpost on.. OC survey?

listening to the BBC Business Daily [[dealing with mass unemployment]], I now believe many people have very limited savings.

However, Raymond, Jack Z... can survive for years, due to lower burn rate and high savings.

--new: risks remain high but am calmer
After circuit breaker, even though infection risk is not lower than before, SG healthcare system is significantly stronger in terms of testing capacity, treatment capacity.

Similarly,

.. bedbug -- the risk remains very very high esp. in terms of suffering, but now I have a more robust mentality

.. tech churn -- disruption remains high, but now I have the insight of WallSt contract market, and I have found java/c++ rather stable. See https://bintanvictor.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=30897&action=edit

I think even if a hiring team doesn't use smart ptr (for that matter, TMP, threading,,), they would drill into this topic as it is a good probe on big4

--new: throw: always explicit in c++
t_clarify
in java, a Throwable object can come from some invisible code, perhaps in the jvm implementation code.

In c++ a catch clause always catches something explicitly thrown by a c++ code module, almost never something from a C library. 

However, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28925878/do-c-standard-library-functions-which-are-included-in-c-throw-exception shows some corner case of undefined behavior in a strcpy(). In such a case, the c++ compiler can do anything such as throwing exception.

Note C functions like strcpy() doesn't throw because C doesn't support exceptions, but c++ compiler is permitted to and does generate throwing code in some corner cases.

-- new: live life2the fullest, but@low burn rate
t_powerfulDescriptor
I guess the ERE author can say he is living his life to the fullest. I don't need to benchmark with him. Similar to him, or unlike him, I do feel I'm living my life to the fullest. There's nothing missing in my current carefree life. My current life is satisfying and complete.

The Bhuddist would say there's still a lot of unsatisfied desires and pains lurking beneath the surface. Admittedly, the pains will surface, but they become mild and forgotten. 

The current condition is obviously impermanent, and possibly short-lived, but in this blogpost I don't care.

green Cornerstone: rewarding, unstressful job
red Cornerstone: boycott to FOMO/FOLB
red Cornerstone: Brbr, ffree
old foundation: health, marriage, citizenship

The red cornerstones are based on cashflow.

--new: sdxq^homeOwnership...
jolt, t_uniBrand
In overpriced markets like Beijing, rental is relatively underpriced and represents a real bargain, but the Chinese doesn't perceive the bargin in a positive light, due to a deep preference for ownership, as an essential basis of security, achievement, social status

How about sdxq homes? Poor bargain in terms of rental demand and commute

How about Ivy League colleges and UChicago? Poor bargain, according to Kyle.

In these cases, mainstream preference is not an accurate reflection of my preference. It's crucial to honor my own preference (and wife's) rather than other people's preferences.

Investment should be supplementary. We need to be competitive and productive in our core competence... If you neglect those and rely too much on investment you will /drift into irrelevance/.
