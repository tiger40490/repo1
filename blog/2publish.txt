There are many variations of "common practices" in c++ but in java/c# the best practice is no-choice. 

No-choice is a Very Good Thing, as proven in practice.

These dynamic languages rely on a single big hammer and make everything look like a nail.

This is another example of "too many variations" in c++.

--new: Y alpha geeks keep working hard
Based on my hypothesis, imagination and a bit of observation.

Majority of the effective, efficient, productive tech professionals don't work long hours because they already earn enough. Some of them can retire if they want to.

Some percentage of them quit a big company or a high position, sometimes to join a startup. One of the reasons -- already earned enough. See my notes on envy^ffree

Most of them value work-life balance. Half of them put this value not on lips but on legs.

Many of them still choose to work hard because they love what they do, or want to achieve more, not because no-choice. See my notes on envy^ffree

--new: the allure of late night quiet time #living with family 
See also the blogpost on early rise

Q: what's the best use of early rise hours?
A: stay home (no distraction) .. can talk to wife. 

I often feel extremely lucky to get a quiet time after kids go to bed. It felt .. precious. But perhaps I can cut yoga, stadium

This quiet time is often inferior to other quiet times

* early rise quiet time is free of kids distraction. I can also talk to wife if I choose to.
* morning commute offers quiet time if I get to use git blogging
* In office I get plenty of quiet time .. early morning, after work, and during lunch break

I feel it's much better to sleep early and get up early. For now we can ignore the health benefits and focus on quiet time.

Consider taking mild sleeping pills to help me regulate. Consult a doctor
