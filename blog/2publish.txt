--Hi Dr Lau,
Two new topics to discuss in Lihui's review.

1) breat implants
Am a bit concerned, perhaps more than needed. I want to know a lot of details on their current conditions, so as to help nudge her to do the right thing for herself, including more frequent mammograms than once a decade:)

My wife never gave me any details. I will try to give her privacy. If she doesn't want to discuss a lot in my presence, then I will wait outside until you finish this discussion.

2) frequency of intimacy
My wife is shy about this topic. I hope she will not stop me asking you questionsj.

Basically, I believe that intimacy between husband and wife is good for reproductive organs, heart, and other body functions. Reproductive organs can give life-threatening problems, right?

Given my and Lihuis age and conditions, I think we should maintain, not decrease, our frequency, right?

There are also two old topics -- my wife thinks I'm too thin too yellowish to be healthy, for my age. I need your help to correct her mis-perception. This is one rare opportunity to have an open, hopefully in-depth, discussion. 

However, she is not alwyas articulate about her concerns. She is a woman of few words. You would need to listen very carefully to her few words and try to understand her concerns. I will take the lead to describe (my view of) her concerns. To save valuable face time, i will describe here.

Her concern is basically based on nothing but superstition. She knows she should lose weight (either for health or for appearance), but she somehow thinks I should NOT lose weight or look more yellowish. I think she's comparing me with so-called male role models, perhaps her family members, her friends' husbands and (hold your breath) a lot of movie stars.

She never mentions anyone who is an endurance athlete, who tend to look too slim to be healthy.

-- update: next HDB home: 
buy first (am picky on the buy)
This will save us the trouble of moving twice.

Possibility of renting out some extra rooms.
