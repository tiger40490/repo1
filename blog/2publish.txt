--update blogpost on WFH:
consider working downstairs for 30 minutes focus
consider early morning on some days, and late night on some days. Consistency? LG2

These quiet hours are now precious resources to be managed carefully.

When in the mood for localSys or project, avoid those blogging distractions.

--update blogpost: Smashing without yelling... possible? Buy or (pick up) some plastic utensils.

--new jolt: focus on my roti: 
In my parenting effort, if I don't focus on my current roti, I would eventually feel the pain.
Analog: if you don't monitor your calorie/burn rate, you will eventually face the cummulative effect.

If some coaching effort is not effective (losing my cool), then stop it early enough, even if boy is suffering in numerous ways, even if I come across as quitter...
Basically, I can waste more time by trying to "help" him.

jolt: my deep (vague) disappointment with my renzi effort was largely due to the worldly, materialistic "progress". 
No progress, then i feel time wasted. That's materialistic and impatience.
