Q: how many tags would be too many in a big blog?
A 500?

Overlapping tags is a bigger problem than a proliferation of distinct tags, so lots of fuxi* or upto* tags are not so bad.

--new: fuxi entries in git-blogg
the "fuxi" entry in git blogg is a crucial feature. Before this invention, I had to decide how to handle such content. 
The content is not worthless to be deleted, but publishing it would lead to either too many low-value bposts, or too much legwork updating existing bposts. 
There's already too much content and insufficient consolidation.

Therefore, the growing "fuxi" content is a necessary evil, and something of an asset.

-- update bpost on nuts
Even though many studies find regular nut-eaters are leaner and more heart-healthy than non-eaters, the nuts won't have a net benefit if we fail to follow the strict guideline

* if you eat X grams of nuts, you must compensate by cutting Y grams of saturated fats
* you must avoid coating with sugar, salt, oil etc, as they could "cancel out" the heart-healthy benefits of nuts !
* you must moderate nuts intake, and avoid binge.

-- update: tiny improvement
my reading/blogg topic is now less introvertive, more extrovertive, more about the society. A good trend, though the reverse is nothing negative.

However, news reading is time consuming, and not as rewarding/fulfilling as my recreational xx.

-- update bpost on cancer
Medical literature often mention short-term stress, like fight-or-flight

short term stress is not so harmful. Chronic stress is.

-- new: longRest->tempRecovery in laptops
Periodically, we had better bring out each laptop (also spectacles) to use for a while. This sentence is vague until I point out 1) oxidation and 2) longRest->recovery.

More than one laptop has shown "longRest->recovery".
I had to power down for many days to get a few hours (or longer) recovery from a defect.

This pattern has many implications.

A slighly defective laptop (eg: A299) can be used in place of a new laptop to prolong the latter's shelf life.

Q: to match an hour of jogging, during quarantine we would need to step up/down on a platform, skip rope or squat, but for how long, and how often can you put up with it? 

The absorbency required is too high ! Sugar coating is crucial, not optional in the form of jogging path

-- new: visible fitness corners
At GardensByTheBay fitness corner and TPY stadium, I enjoy more absorbency against boring strength training. 

Fort Caning fitness corner is so-so.

In all other fitness corners like downstairs, I feel poor absorbency.

I think key is visibility to the onlookers. 

Some gyms put workout equipments right beside a big window, so gym users are easily visible from the busy street outside. Visibility can serve as a potent motivation.

-- new: inflation n wage
theoretical
see also https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/549/inflation-in-singapore-personal-xp/

Many economic theories assume that for a particular household, high inflation can be offset by higher wages. This sweeping, simplistic assumption has many weaknesses

* during high inflation, many households have no working member .. unemployed, retired,,,
* during high inflation, many (more than we think) sectors do not experience higher profit, and are unable to increase wages beyond a token increment
* during high inflation, many wage earners have no bargaining power at all.

How about intRate? Does it grow with inflation? I have lived through many eras to question this broad assumption.

-- new: English as a common working language]SG 
English is needed as a common working language in Singapore (also U.S.)

I assume the standard of English is falling in HK

There's a need to balance two needs

* All of these governments recognize immigrants' right to speak their original language when living in Singapore. Original language is well-recognized as more effective esp. as the immigrant copes with numerous challenges in a new place. Singapore is not the easiest new country for an immigrant.
* The requirement for basic English skill at the workplace + schools. The pressure to learn English may push some of these immigrants to reduce original language usage, as a strategy to speed up English learning.

So at the minimum, SG immigration (and job interviewers) require each immigrant to be "effective" in listening and reading, and also expressing themselves clearly in the common language. 

In reality, many China immigrants (my younger self) struggle and experience some level of disadvantage/handicap in English-dominant places of Singapore.

-- update glamorous woman
Lin Chi-ling
Teresa Teng
Charlie Yeung
Zoe Tay
Gigi Leung

These glamorous women each chose a man "lower" in wealth and power. In a way, such a glamorous woman has made enough money and doesn't need more money. She does need equality in marriage.

Once they commit to a marriage, they become extremely vulnerable. They would have a marriage to protect. They may have kids to protect. Statistically, marriage failure within her circle was higher than average, perhaps 30%. 

The power, wealth, good looks.. on the opposite side is a hazard.

In fact, many of them didn't marry someone older, because an older man attracted to a young glamorous woman can easily get seduced by an even younger woman

Therefore, these glamorous women were shrewd. They know their priority, their weaknesses, their risks.

-- new: speak slowly when..
when speaking to someone new
when speaking on the phone rather than face to face
when spaking about something sensitive or important
when nervous.
when in front of many people

.. no one speaks too slowly. Most peopel including me speak too fast.

If you have a tendency to stutter, then slow speaking can reduce it. If not eliminated, then slow speaking with stutter is a kind of unique personal style. It's not perfect but it can be disarming and earn you trust.

I heard a departing colleague's truthful reflections including the reasons for the departure. One of the reasons is related to comp benchmark. I guess (with good level of confidence) that he feels that given his value-add and effort, he should receive $XX more (whatever XX is).

The more one dwells on it, the more one would feel unfair -- Someone else in the same team has the same level of value-add but was rewarded much more.

It's a valuable protection that I don't put in extra effort and sacrifice for the manager. It protects me from the hazard of harmful comparision. If you don't compare, you feel satisfied. If you do, your bubble bursts and derails.

At my age, I don't salary-benchmark as much as in my 30s -- I don't care so much about wasting my potential, my spare capacity. It's good and bad. 

It's bad if I am chronically underpaid (20% below market) like J.Zhang.
It's good if my employer and my manager is generous and keen to retain older SWEs like me.
