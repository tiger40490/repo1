Most people are only familiar with capital gains investing - buying something at a low price, selling it at a higher price, and pocketing the difference.

--new: ##reasonable, non-essential, addictive foods
For these foods, most of us mere mortals find the wrong-quantity temptation challenging, so I would say "Stay as far away from these foods as possible".

rice
nuts

--new: increase tolerance for raw veg #deeper-green
The higher my tolerance for raw veg, without any taste-enhancer, the better my chance of long-term health. 
The higher my tolerance for home yoga practice without any help, the better my chance of long-term health

higher tolerance = deeper-green zone.

Caution -- if i can tolerate the extreme form of diet and celebrate it too explicitly, then I develop a negative perception of the less extreme yet worthwhile diets like fruits

Eg: raw celery and carrot without any dressing
Eg: Sat morning yoga on hard surface .. is extreme, and when I decide to go realYoga studio I felt like a weakling
Eg: no movie for a year .. is extreme. When I decide to use movie as a reward I hear a nagging zsms
