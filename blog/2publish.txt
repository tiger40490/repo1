--new: amidst the demands, focus on protecting
* protect my precious job -- the numerous precious features
* protect family harmony -- boy's PSLE is one of the biggest threats
* protect my current wellness condition -- diet, exercise,,,, demands time + absorbency

For these protections, I'm willing to spend more money (not tcost) like tutors, nearby family outings (tcost)

? protect my carefree cash-flow -- the BGC situation is not yet carefree
? protect my interview readiness? I think I will NOT lose it so soon.

--new jolt: time spent blogg`about boy=therapeutic
Time spend blogging about boy is therapeutic. 

Also, the time spent preparing his math worksheet is therapeutic -- a landed punch; am able to focus, calm down and make (albeit slow) progress; gaining traction rather than wheel-spinning

I'm good at these even though they take up huge amount of energy and precious quiet time.
Luckily I don't feel worn out by these efforts.

I feel at my age, parenting IS a main job, comparable to my day job. 
Actually, Career progression is NOT my main responsibility at this stage of my life.

--new: better blog post titles:
catchy phrases
sharp questions

It requires time and mental energy to create and improve blog titles. 
Effective titles help organize my thoughts on a complex and challenging subject such as parenting or diet. 
Such a subject may grow to 200 blogposts, so without effective organization lots of content become effectively lost.

--new: effective text highlighting in git-blog etc
* most versatile is __connected_underline__
* color, bold, font size, strike-through
* underline -- confusing (hyperlink)
* italics -- hardly noticeable on its own. Need to combine with other highlighting
