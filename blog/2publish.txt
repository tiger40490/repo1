--new blogpost ##lessons from the 2-pivot partition algo

Lesson: get the edge cases out of the way early on, so as to focus on the core algo

Lesson: arr[ri] has no invariant. Invariant is on arr[ri+1]

--new blogpost: dev-lead IV is not easy.
Passing the tech interview to get a dev-lead role isn't easy. It can change your career.
competition can be tough. 

So I think my ex-colleagues need a lot of effort to pass those interviews. 
Just look at CSY and Deepak and my own attempt to get into HFT .. how many failures and how much t-investment needed.

It takes more than on-the-job learning. It takes months or years of absorbency, sustained focus... Most of us underestimate that bar until we try and fail repeatedly to clear it.

--update blogpost on sg19 priorities
salary is really something to play down... as I don't need to compare with the joneses
Real decision -- if I give in to the temptation and try the banks i will get interviews for sure and likely receive big offers.
need to avoid them (even the non-US) as they don't serve to open up new markets and can be more stressful

11. respect, benchmark, stigma, damaged good
33. c++ rather than java
44. commute + salary

--update blog on worst yoga poses:
gravity makes a huge diff
* split-plow is good for lower-back/adductor; holding toes in open-leg stand is better for adductor/lower-back... much better than 'open-leg sitting and reach fwd'
* warrior is much better than 3-leg dog, lie-down split or standing split
