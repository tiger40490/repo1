t_misperception

Critical thinking .. home cooking is better nutrition, but why my experience proved that my BMI was always better when living alone without home cooking? I would say quantity outweighs quality. 

quality of comercial food .. nowadays I buy more raw foods, less affected by inferior nutritional quality of commercial cooking. 
fast food .. is known for poor nutritional quality, but I seldom eat fast food when living alone.
home food still involves commercial cooked foods such as bakeries, ice creams
nuts .. as a group is never home-cooked. If I eat at home, the nuts in the home stash become unexpected and hazardous.
fish and meat .. perhaps home cooking is better quality, but by how many percent?
vegetables.. perhaps home cooking is better quality. Nowadays I tend to eat raw.
starch at home .. tend to be too enticing. The home stash has lots of outside starch food
starch bought outside .. tend to have more fiber, and stored in a stash under control
soymilk .. home-made is better, and I don't overeat.
milkshake .. home-made is better. 

-- new: buying wellness: how effective@@
There are many "research" or marketing that link fancy new products to wellness. You would think the rich would live healthier lives? Alas, the correlation is very low.

I will use star-rating and dollar-rating ..
$$$*** more free time .. commute; lower-pay jobs
* less driving, more walking, cycling
* simple, low-cost workout equipmenets similar to what I now keep
$$* nearby gym/pool/basketballCourt/// as provided by an office or condo
$** yoga (and other) classes
$ fancy fruits

Note most of the cost-effective items are low-cost.

Note I consciously reject most of the supplements, fancy expensive food. 

$130/M gym fee is tolerable to me, but most of us use the gym only once a week. Let's assume 8 times/M

How about $16/visit flat rate? I would feel I could save the money by working out at home. 
Jolt: but can you do that consistently?

Paying the monthly fee motivates me to go there regularly.

-- update blogpost on the limitations of bccy
bitcoin is supposed to remove the central authority, replaced with the consensus mechanism. However, the software is still controlled by an elite group of programmers. There's always some governance in any open source codebase.

== update lifestyle creep
When a family's disposable income grows, family members break traditional guidelines of simple life

eg: "family car" -> 2 cars per family still not enough
eg: "sharing a bedroom between 2 kids" -> one bed room per kid
eg: "Aircon in bedrooms only" -> a/c in living room and kitchen

-- CpfLife ERS amount won't be enough.
-- which level of ffree? well above Level 5 ffree

-- new: gpgpu ~ ab-initio: NOT general purpose
rule engine is another example

All of these vendors claim that their products are revolutionary and leave the traditional solutions in the dust.

However, the use cases are extremely niche. The skill is not highly sought after.

-- new: all-at-once: appraisal
as employee, when I have family issues, kids issues, investment foes, I would fear an appraisal. Even a bonus disappointment would add a heavy blow.

As contractor, no such fear. When I'm let go, I would easily attribute it to budget and go job hunting again.

-- update mag:
sometimes I get into a low mood and carry a negative perception about many of my books, so even a big home library may be insufficient. The gen magazine is an alternative.

-- update or new: personal system4stock-picking 
if you want to gradually develop a personal stock-picking "system", then you need to make a large number of small but real decision, over different times. A few big trades won't grow your confidence fast enough.

To become an experienced stock investor, you also need to make many informed decisions and learn from that experience.

Q: how much retrospective analysis needed?
A: not about how many hours but how much real traction you gain (not wheel-spinning). You should cut down the review when you notice dimishing return.

Quick learning is an advantage of stock vis-a-vis other investments.

-- new: supper floodgate
Tip: end the planned supper with lots of comfort foods, rather than raw veg. I used to have lots of raw veg towards the end, hoping to fill up my stomach, but actually the stomach is impossible to fill up, and the unsatisfying raw food demanded /compensation/ in the form of comfort foods.

Q: Why do I end my supper with lots of energy dense comfort foods including starch, but I didn't feel the same craving in the beginning?
A: I guess the floodgate was opened and hard to close.

-- update post on 5/wk
when it's hard to hit 5/wk,
* be flexible with shorter workouts. Start early during the day. Once I complete a few rounds, it would be easy to hit one session

-- new: Chinese/Korean couple: bad assumptions
ML.Jiang once told me about some classmates. A Chinese national and a Korean national living in Singapore as a couple, who spoke Japanese at home.

I was impressed.

Immediately I assumed that they speak mostly Japanese between them and their Japanese fluency is equal to their mother tongue.

Well, DaShan the Canadian in China is one in probably 1000 foreigners who speak such fluent Chinese. So to a Japanese national, both of them probably sound non-Japanese.

The less you know someone, the more you assume... Remember HY.Cai

--new: reduce(grave)compliance risk
pre-clear large qty like $1k/name
If I have many names to trade at the same time, then risk of oversight is higher. Avoid working while trading.
small (even fractional) orders are still safer than big orders.
