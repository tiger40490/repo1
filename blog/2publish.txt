--new: no stress no gain
BMI, diet, yoga, workout ... all demand mental effort, focus and stress. 

A bullet fired towards a target is in free motion... hit or miss, but for a missile to aim at a moving target and adjust its flight, control is required.
As soon as we set an (however vague) expectation and take aim, we take on a challenge and set ourself up for stress.

Our self-esteem is now at stake.

Similarly the coding drill...

My son may not have this self-control yet.

--new: weight-loss theories: conflicting evidence
even if i eat lots of fruits, meat and low starch, i could still put on weight
I may need to accept it. Calorie theory breakdown?
Perhaps see an expert dietitian?

More imp -- avoid eating when not hungry

There are many diverging opinions on calorie restriction and weight loss. Even the scientists disagree, citing conflicting evidence. If you are serious about weight loss, you must choose what to believe. Here are a few pillar beliefs I choose to hold tight.
* my personal safe BMI is 18.5. A good summary is the letter to Susan Lee, but I have many blog posts under t_j4slim, written from different angles.
* raw vegetables are safe .. can eat as much as I like; most fruits are safe, even if sweet. The starchy fruits are not tasty and I won't eat too much anyway.
* home cooked vegetables are safe. Can eat with a bit of starch
* it's tough but safe to reduce oily and starchy food towards zero
* I don't worry about malnutrition as I do eat non-trivial amount of starch + fat 
* protein powder is generally safe

The calorie theory on weight loss is a life-science theory, not a physical science theory, so there are many exceptions.

--new: primer on fatty foods
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good is a good overview with examples.

I tend to treat most fatty foods as equals .. unwise :(

Trans fats have no known health benefits and there is no safe level of consumption. Therefore, they have been officially banned in the United States

Saturated fats are common in the American diet. They are solid at room temperature and show up in red meat, whole milk and other whole-milk dairy foods including cheese.

Healthy fats are liquid at room temperature, not solid. There are two broad categories of beneficial fats: monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.

Good sources of monounsaturated fats are olive oil, avocados, and most nuts including peanuts. They are still calorie-dense.
