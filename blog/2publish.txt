--update blog on survivor
My sampling technique was biased, statistically. I didn't count the number of times I survived layoff:

* OC through the transfer
* Stirt through the meet/meet
* Macq through the transfer

My perception of each entire period was tainted -- "once I got a PIP, all subsequent positive evidence is negligible."
