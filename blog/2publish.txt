--new: deallocation cost: j^c+++
Based on a brief chat with Martin Thompson..
java has no deallocation cost. C++ deallocation is worse than allocation. Deallocation may use locking if performed across threads.

--update blogpost on locus
if you attribute success to effort, you sound cocky, conceited, vain

--update on c++ guys unlucky.
Out of 100 java guys trying WallSt jobs, 90 are disqualified in tech screening, often in early rounds. Too many weak candidates without depth.

Out of 100 c++ guys trying WallSt jobs, perhaps 70 are disqualified for the same reason. This does NOT mean your chance of success is higher. The opposite is more likely. The remaining 30 get filtered out in later rounds, for reasons like "well-qualified but not a good match, not exactly what we want"

The expertise entry-barrier is higher in C++, due to wider range of essential knowledge. Java is considered more of a commodity skill.

Therefore, it's easier for me to ace the java QQ interview than c++ QQ interview.

--new: price^value when choosing smartphones
price of smartphone depends on
* branding
* component cost such as processor speed, RAM size, screen size, battery capacity
* Is reliability a factor? Not directly. Perhaps the brand and components have an indirect effect

According to my requirements, the "value" of a model depends on
1. reliability
2. screen size
3. battery

--new: ## topics spanning multiple blogs
schooling -- mostly in 61060, but SDXQ goes into tanbinvest
U.S. migration -- mostly in 610610, but tanbinvest covers housing, commute topics
retirement destination -- mostly in tanbinvest, but some country comparison is in 610610

--new: 温故知新@blog beats frenDialog 
There's a lot of insight in my blogposts for 温故知新. Arguably more fruitful than email exchanges with friends and reading books.

Email exchange is more efficient than calling friends.

Reading books is more rewarding than reading online.

YJL said he would stay close to the child. I think it is actually practical. They can help out and also receive help when they are old.
For my wife and me, perhaps the more important criteria is job. I want to have a dev job till my 70's. Not likely in Singapore.

--update blogpost on 3 likely derailers of current carefree easy life
My current carefree phase has lasted more than a year since late 2018. 

Q: what are the derailers observed so far, based on facts, not forecasts not sentiments?
A: The only brief derailers were ah-boy's math weakness and the lockdown pains. In terms of sentiments I worried briefly about PIP

Perhaps the academic pressure can be considered a long-term worry

Let's put on the red and black hats, and throw open this question to get more ideas

I think this is a short-horizon analysis, not so valuable. Beware othRisk -- Most of the major identifiable derailers are probably listed in the blogpost already. 

Some major derailers are hard to foresee. How about
* family harmony disrupted
* something broken at home
* something lost
* conflicts with colleagues
* medical conditions
* injuries
* accidents
