--update blogpost on le2sis
My friend K.Hu's email is quite in-depth. I can see that he still works hard for long-term family livelihood. 
( I guess Ashish is more carefree, due to bachelor's life. )

I'm older and more mellow in terms of Brbr, exclub/FOLB, ambition, career growth... Wellness, lifestyle adjustment, healthcare, choice of home country, retirement planning are more important as I grow older. Therefore, livelihood is not such a big driver.

Cashflow is a factor (sometimes a minor factor) in each topic above. However, cashflow should not dominate every topic.

-- update blogpost on SEA street food
In SG the hawker center stalls are not popular with the younger generation of stall owners.  This trend could translate to nutrition inflation. 

However, foreigner owners might be taking over the stalls.

That's why I always bring the most tempting food to office.

--new jolt: Deepak on daily exercise
This analysis is based on 5 min of chat
Deepak said compared to diet, exercise is relatively easy becasue he can do some exericse everyday. My perception of him affects my perception of my son. I tend to dismiss Deepak's claim on exercise. Perhaps he was doing relatively light exercise, perhaps for 30min+ each day for a few months. Reality is...
* Very few individuals (perhaps 1~3%) can achieve that.
* perhaps grandpa, with his strong self-mangement, could achieve something slightly higher at age 40. I'm not better than Deepak. I couldn't do 30min every day.
* even if his effort is not maintained for multiple years, there's a health benefit for the overweight individual, in terms of weight + various organs

--new: writing to map 
put_If_Absent: java uses putIfAbsent(); c++ uses insert()
insert_Or_Update (most common map "Writing"): java uses put(); c++ uses operator[]. 
update_If_Existing: c++ needs if-block; java uses replace() which returns null if nothing replaced; 

Note computeIfAbsent() is kinda more efficient than putIfAbsent which unconditionally computes the new "value" even though there's a 50/50 chance it is unneeded -- i.e. the incumbent scenario.

--new: data center ^ cloud@@

Q: does data center rack space always mean some form of cloud?

Q: if not, then what's the difference between a regular data center and a cloud?

Two major sectors:
* financial companies -- generally use private data centers, probably not cloud. The grid/farm could offer elasticity i.e. compute nodes enlisted on demand, but I don't know if (docker) containers are created on the fly.
* web sites -- often uses the cloud, but not necessarily the elastic cloud

The other sectors are unfamiliar to me.

So whenever I hear people talk about cloud or grid, I would enquire about container
