or new : DCA assumes long-term strength of US stocks
This strength is evident only in US stocks, and not in Nsdq. 
DCA in Singapore stocks ... questionable.
Without this strength, your DCA could underperform "holding cash forever"

The "long term" should match your xjlCrunch. In many geographical equity markets, the long-term "strength" can require 30Y of patient wait.

Y avoid branded colleges
If a branded top-quality middle school costs $20k/Y over 2Y, then many would be able to afford it, but could the brand give the parents esteem for decades?

A branded college does make the parents proud for decades, and makes the graduate stand out in over-crowded dating markets, but look at the price tag. If the 70k/Y price tag is clearly /affordable/ to you, then you won't need to be a "wise consumer". For most families, however, 300k over 4Y is too high, so these families need to assess the benefit/cost.

Those with insider info often realize the benefit is not so high.

Some ETFs pays dividend from capital gain, just like mufu !

-- LG2 update which one? bpost on speed coding or NBA?
Street dance ^ eGaming ^ speed coding
Street dance skill can't make money for you.
Singing is similar.
Piano is similar but .... can teach... There's a good demand.

basketball talent .. Top 0.1% can make money

Speed coding is very different. Many companies are interested to hire you.


-- update bpost on commute (which one?)
Need to balance 2 priorities (3 would be max)
logistical efficiency .. printed material (without need4writing) is far more efficient than git-blogg esp. for short trips or with transfers
productivity zsms .. laptop with coding or tech QQ, or tech books 

When is best time for git-blogg? Looks like an unwanted child. Commute is a good choice, even if not the very best.
When is best time for my growing recreational books? In office and home


-- LG2 update bpost on feel`satisfied more than peers
in a 2022 nightmare, I rejoined Macq and was dismissed again. 
I did my best but again was shown to be the weakest in the team, although another set of requirements may prove otherwise.

In hind sight, the Macq job requirement was simply too high for me.
How about AshS in his CTO job? CSDoctor's job? S.Liu's job?

If I were to benchmark myself with these so-called peers, or try to increase my brank, and join the exclub, I would get derailed, lose my carefree ezlife, take on lots of stress. 
If I try, could I become a software architect? Not my strength.
If I try, could I become a lead developer like AshS? Not sure. 

At my age, I have an implicit self-conviction that most of the higher-paying positions are too stressful, with exorbitant expectation.
What I'm unsure is the salary hike if I jump. (My EPA job would be worth sgd 160k in another company.) What additional income is possible? After tax, 100k/Y additional? Not worth it.

I told grandpa that my successE [carefree ezlife + harmony, based on wellness and comfortable livelihood] is rare among my cohort, not because I'm wealthier than them, but because I don't focus on the wrong goals.

The nightmare scenario is much more severe, harsh, harmful than CB2022.


-- new: blue-chip SG stocks=well-regarded internationally
* bulk of the total return comes from dividends. I think these high-yield stocks are mostly government linked.
* SGD has proven very strong against most currencies. I think we had better stop focusing on USD.

3 types of inflation: CCA
consumer goods inflation .. (retail market)
commodity inflation .. (wholesale market) can stem from wage inflation
asset inflation .. I think mostly real assets, not equities or bonds.


-- new: career insecurity: 2017 watershed
t_vague
2017 marked a watershed in my perception of career insecurity.
Before the watershed, I had a learned insecurity, instilled in me due to decades of brainwash, and internalized.

tech churn .. defeating any attempt of accumulation
The widespread and entrenched notion that "Few can remain hands-on till 40."
threat from younger or stronger competitors.
DRam refresh .. and maintain your critical mass
strengthen your moat, maintain your lead 
Don't drop out from the leading pack.
slow income growth outpaced by long-term inflation not only in home prices.

I felt like a (less successful version of) EDB -- can't afford to slow down, because of the constant risk of getting outrun/outmaneuvered, or caught up... The risk of losing our relevance.

After the watershed, I could see the end of my IN-voluntary marathon. Now am planning my own light marathon driven by successZ. 
This marathon could take me all the way to 70s. 
I hope to enjoy it.
Therefore, for the remainder of the marathon I could afford to slow down to a stroll, drop out of the leading pakc, and let other people overtake me, as happend in Toa Payoh stadium jogging track.

I told SY.C that my 100k/Y dev-till70 is not passive acceptance and failureZ, because I still make an effort -- a light maratho is still a marathon.
