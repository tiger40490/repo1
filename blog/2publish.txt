-- update: buy-n-forget.
My stocks could be overvalued, but I don't bother to babysit them. The tcost and stress of babysitt is too high. My firewall would break, and the volatility would boil over.

I do need to reduce my positions in low-yield and unproven stocks. They are at higher risk of getting overvalued.

-- new: "move"%%rEstate portfolio to SG in my twilight years
I have always agreed to the prudent advice that as we age, our risk appetite drops and we should rationalize/adjust our rEstate portfolio to less risky countries. Every country has risk factors, but SG remains the least risky.

-- new underrated j4 blogg
We grow wiser via adversities + reflections [including expressive writing]. Without reflections, the growth is slower. We may even forget the details of the adversity and fail to learn from it.

The above may belong to another blogpost

[d = true, but often neglected, discounted, dismissed]
blogg can stretch your child's IQ. One of the best single measures of overall intelligence as measured by intelligence tests is vocabulary.
Writing has critical connections to speaking. I need more improvement in speaking than writing.
[d] Blogg increases chance of achiving personal goals... 
[d] Emotional intelligence (both self and inter-personal). Even without sending out my writing, whenever I write down another person's perspective, I get a better understanding.
[d] Blogg can spark your creativity, esp. when facing a tough challenge that requires creative problem solving.
[d] Blogg can enhance self-esteem and self-confidence. Reflections on positive experiences can build a catalog of personal achievements that you continue to go back to. Indeed I revisit my positive experiences via blogg. I also blog about negative experience for learning and coping.

To achieve the shortest titles, use Chinese wording, even though they are less valuable for sharing.

..risk: real yoga may relocate .. unused credits. 
Better use up once a week or so 

..risk: fractional shares held at Rbh
Better "Buy" on those names that are close to a whole share.

-- update: pw recovery questions
the most tricky is 'your employer'. Just tell them "I change job every year. Please ask another question."

Another tricky question is "how many ATM cards". Just tell them "I use only 2 ATM cards".

The hotline will not remove the question even if they understand me.

I think this frustration is similar to having strange names (Kranti?), non-permanent addresses, multiple email addresses.

in the late 2000s, my mom said CNY 400k was a good-enough medical reserve for each retiree, on top of public health insurance (reimbursement-based). Such insurance has coinsurance, and numerous exclusions such as elective treatments [imported medication, supplements,,]. 

In 2022 my dad recalled that consensus figure among retirees of that time -- regardless of the medical condition, if CNY 500k is spent over and on top of insurance, and still the life can't be saved, then it's reasonable to give up. As such CNY 500k was a reasonable last-resort personal medical reserve, for millions of well-informed Chinese retirees.

Fast forward to 2022, CNY 500k-1000k of family savings is common according to my dad, living in Beijing. I think this improvement in savings reflects (medical++) inflation, rising income, rising wealth esp. in rEstate.

chin-up 100/D was daunting.. my traction secret is spread-out.

-- new: hotlines in U.S.
cat: retire where

Rude awakening in early 2007: Government services were often very poor. Hit numerous immigration problems. ID issuance was slow. DMV had huge lines. Post office had shorter lines but inadequate hotlines.

Government Hotlines are overloaded...

Many government services are self-service, either online or by write-in [still common as of 2007]. Many complicated procedures with pages of instructions to read. Often you must ask friends + self-teach. Still you can hit roadblocks that require commercial, professional assistance.Â Sometimes there was a visible effort to simplify (or explain) the process for new users. I would say far from effective. In contrast, Singapore goverment services come with plenty of hotline staff (occasionally community centers too) .. adequate staffing !

Semi-government, non-profit services are similar. Hospitals, utilities, schools, credit bureaus, airports, transport authorities, police, legal systems, IRS,,,

Some big private [i.e. for-profit] service providers have adequate customer support, often tiered based on your account tier! I noticed it in GS, Verizon, ... So if you don't have enough in-house expertise, then you need to pay a premium.

In 2007, I couldn't afford to pay the premium :(

Alternatively, smaller service providers offer better customer support.

-- new blogg vs writing4publication
taking note of a memorable conversation: I tend to confuse two modes

* journalist taking notes for potential publication use. This mode often provides active recreation, and keeps my vocab and my mind active, even improving.
* taking personal notes for my own review

In my 30's, I would take a critical view on my friends (like Chonglei.Qi) who had unique, sometims incisive, observations on many topics. I often say "commit to writing down your observations and get them published." That would lead to more meaningful discussions and create more value-add.

For some years, I also had a dim view on private diary (in contrast to public blog). I would insist that it was important to review the content with other people. But now I wonder how important.

Over the decades since, I have realized that 1) a reputable (serious) publication, or 2) a real review with a friend, all entail huge amounts of time and energy. 

In reality, personal diary/blog + some email discussion is the only reasonable compromise I can have. Without peer review, it's not solid, complete, balanced, but still it is a valuable deep-dive, exploration. (I have left out the therapeutic blogg that is often intermixed with my general blogging.)

Note all of these activities can (and did) take up sooo much spare time, that they often become the primary energy-sink of the year

Writing vs reading.. Scope here is non-fiction, including current affairs,,, I always feel most people, across education levels, don't read as much as is good for them (due to different priority or available leisure time). Among those "lifelong" readers, I believe most don't write nearly as much as I do. Nothing wrong, but I feel if you are seriously reading some topics, then you must have your personal observations. Writing (later reviewing) them is an excellent practice to enhance understanding. That includes clarifying, deepening, correlating, comparison, pattern-finding, correcting mistakes, finding appropriate phrasing... So I always feel if you are serious about some reading topic, then you had better work on improving your understanding. If you don't use writing, then what can you use?
