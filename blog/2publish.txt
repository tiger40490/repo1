-- new: Chn not rising as a financial superpower #CNY,eq
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/china-yuan-renminbi-currency-flow-us-dollar-finance-2758231

As of 2022, the yuan is not viewed as a safe haven, Chinese stocks languish and no Chinese city is more than a regional financial centre.

I think HK/Tokyo/SG qualify as global financial centers because their currencies do not scare foreign investors.

About 90 per cent of foreign exchange transactions involve the US dollar, while only 5 per cent use yuan. 

Some depict the yuanâ€™s tiny 3% (2.88% as of 2022 https://data.imf.org/regular.aspx?key=41175) share of global central bank reserves as quick progress because it is up from 1% five years ago. But this share is similar to those of far smaller economies like Canada or Australia, and well behind what analysts have been projecting.

Foreigners own about 5 per cent of stocks in China, versus 25 to 30 per cent in other emerging markets, and about 3 per cent of bonds in China, compared to around 20 per cent in other developing nations. I think HKEX is considered outside China.

I heard a departing colleague's truthful reflections including the reasons for the departure. One of the reasons is related to comp benchmark. I guess (with good level of confidence) that he feels that given his value-add and effort, he should receive $XX more (whatever XX is).

The more one dwells on it, the more one would feel unfair -- Someone else in the same team has the same level of value-add but was rewarded much more.

It's a valuable protection that I don't put in extra effort and sacrifice for the manager. It protects me from the hazard of harmful comparision. If you don't compare, you feel satisfied. If you do, your bubble bursts and derails.

At my age, I don't salary-benchmark as much as in my 30s -- I don't care so much about wasting my potential, my spare capacity. It's good and bad. 

It's bad if I am chronically underpaid (20% below market) like J.Zhang.
It's good if my employer and my manager is generous and keen to retain older SWEs like me.

-- LG2 new: when we size up someone: socioeconomic
First impression is like judging a book by its cover. In this bpost i'm looking at socioeconomic strata. Let's limit to 3 elements: 

physical wellness [posture, skin, dental] .. 5% ~~> 25% of my assessment
educated and sophisticated vocab/articulation/manners .. continues to be 45%
ethnicity/nationality/accent .. 50% ~~> 30%, esp. relevant when sizing up caucasians
.. citizenship is usually unknown. Here I am talking about implied nationality.

Dress .. is not a factor in itself but often a subtle hint of education, income, and socioeconomic strata.
