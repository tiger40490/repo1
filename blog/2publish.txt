-- update bpost about inferiority
If I'm a CAD patient in Japan, I may worry about my country's quality of medical care. I would worry that Japan doctors are not fluent enough in English...

The pattern -- whichever group I find myself in, I tend to worry about its calibre and quality.

Pack your phone earlier if possible. If you assume it's impossible to forget your phone, you will realize the impossible does happen quite often.

-- new slow-cooking: growing richer but not happier
"Compared to the post-war era or pre-modernization era, we are substantially richer but no happier."

This is a dominant [widely shared] observation in many countries, at both a societal and a personal level.

In contrast to satisfaction and fulfillment, "happy" is a short-term self-assessment/rating. Re hbA1c vs FPG.

I think most people won't bother to focus or reflect on everyday forgetable happiness, including those doses of delight. We need to focus our mental energy on the problems to solve. Therefore, we tend to remember our adversities [sufferings, difficulties, frustrations, setbacks, declines]. The longer we live, the more difficulties we encounter. Our happiness self-rating would tend to decline. Therefore, improving longevity tends to affect happiness rating.

Basic-healthy nutrition .. our increasing wealth makes BHN easily achievable, but in only x% of the population would BHN bring happiness. 

inflation .. (rent, medical, transport, fashion, entertainment,,,) creates long-term worry in any age group. I think in previous eras, the average people don't save so much, and don't live so long

sleep easy .. physical wealth seldom gives the individual better sleep, but granted, wealth can bring you a quiet home and flexible work hours.

tech churn in personal tech .. I think many (esp. older) adults don't want to keep learning, adjusting to new tech. Many feel forced to do so. The GUI is often designed for and tested with younger users.

isolation due to digital communication.. digital comm is a big part of economic growth, but it doesn't make me happier.

Obligation to save for retirement... is a decade-long thankless job and constant sacrifice. 
This obligation, sacrifice, stewardship, due diligence, risk-management,,, affecs our simple happiness. We are forced to stay on our toes. 
People in poor living conditions don't need to save that much for retirement, and their retirement years are shorter.

Involuntary delay to retirement .. often due to poor retirement plann

More years spent taking care of sick parents.. Watching their decline somehow makes me feel less happy For Them.. pessimism.

How about mom and dad after selling the home? I think they would indeed get a better quality of life in the luxury retirement home. Grandma would become happier .. I choose to be optimistic for both of them.
