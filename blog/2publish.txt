-- new blogpost speed-reading^slow-digestion of legacy code
speed-reading (Understanding big/small program quickly) ... is my competitive weakness, but once I understand a codebase I am often more proficient than co-workers, capable of precision laser surgery :)

Andrew Yap, Ashish Singh, ... are all better at speed reading.

I need to take many notes and refresh them. 

Debugging my own code is easier than debugging other people's code. This is more obvious for me than other guys

In speed coding, if I have to read lengthy error messages, I'm slower than other guys. That's why I prefer python.
