Jack He also said affluent families often have full time mom taking care of kids.

I think the value-investing seminar target audience also feel a similiar burden -- How the hell can I sustain my BASIC $2k/head family lifestyle if I don't want to work so hard for 30Y and then sustain the same lifestyle beyond retirement? Their problem is really the burn rate.

In terms of burn rate, I'm blessed with a frugal wife, SG citizenship ..
