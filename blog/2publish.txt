-- new: too well-off
In 2021 I described myself as too well-off to feel the hunger for more earning power.
growing fat and happy.

Well-off is less than rich or wealthy.

Context was my tech learning and localSys learning energy.

--new: cash -> SA via housing refund
For 10k (up to 150k) of my OA money parked outside cpf (parked in some bank acct or FSM ..), every year it may generate a return of, say, 1.1%. 

However, until you sell your flat, this 10k must accrue a nominal 2.5% a year either in or outside CPF.
* if growing inside CPF, then the government pays me 2.5%. Even 4% is available if you transfer that 10k to SA.
* if parked outside CPF, then I am paying myself that nominal 2.5%, paying from investment return (if invested) or liquid cash (if parked in banks)
* so 30 years later when I sell the HDB flat, after the dust settles exactly the same compounded amount (10k * 1.025^30) would end up in OA. OA end balance after flat sale is an invariant.

Q: by parking the 10k outside cpf, you get to USE the money (liquidity) for investment, vacation etc but can you generate enough profit to beat the guaranteed compound rate of 4%?

Note you can't really "park" the 10k in the HDB flat as the flat appreciates by itself, regardless of your 10k. The flat is not an account you can top up incrementally.

Q: perhaps I should transfer 10k (up to 150k) from bank acct to OA then OA -> SA since I have no use for my spare cash?

What if (10% probability) we want to upgrade HDB home before 55? As discussed with Felicia, 
* sales proceeds + wife's CPF-OA can be deployed to reduce the mtg to $200k
* By the time we take up the mortgage, I would have some CPF-OA balance. I have the option to deploy it.

--update blogpost on becoming lifestyle
Most people accept that they would 1) want to stop working sometime in their 60's 2) not be accepted by employers at that age, unless they are doctors, accountants or professors.

Therefore, they don't work to build career longevity. Most likely they won't achieve career longevity. Their lifestyle is part of the reason. 

I don't accept that lifestyle.

--new: worst unacceptable outcome@boy
.. is not benchmark disappointments including career progression
.. is not wellness condition
David's answer -- refusal to talk to parents
Grandpa's answer -- running away from home

My answer is -- effort. If he puts in effort but ends up with those results, I feel I would love him unconditionally. I recall XR's autistic son.

Teresa Teng was not a strong math student but worked hard at every subject.

Currently, despite his piano practice, his poor effort everyday is eroding the loving relationship. Unconditional love is under threat. Boy is very sensitive and can probably sense it.

Grandma notices the tension between two forces inside me. She drew this analogy -- imagine your sponse is diagnoised with cancer. You experience the huge pressure to take on the huge legwork and decide on treatment options for the spouse. At the same time, you may also feel the tendency to reject the cancer, and blame the cancer, but the cancel won't go away. Grandma said the 2nd, negative emotion is counterproductive. Yet it is real and common. 
I feel this is a good analogy. The cancer may be incurable. You still have a job to fight it and slow down its progression.

Remember Biden's love for his son, despite his drug problem. I would say he is still a successful father. Indeed a father would be successful if he did his best to stop the progression of such an addiction.

In the same blogpost, there's also a gay son's story. Is that an "effort" problem?

I'm no perfect child. If I have a son like me, is there something I can't accept? Theft!

My son has no aggression, no cruelty, no dishonesty,,,, that's why I find his laziness unacceptable.
