--new: brainwash: "medium" leetcode
The medium/hard classification should be ignored --- counterproductive, highly subjective. Do you judge a movie by hearing a friend's rating of it without watching?

I find the "hard" questions are no harder than "medium" and some "medium" are very tough.

The official rating sounds authoritative and represents brainwash

--new: ##hacky solutions
A typical hacky solution -- uses xml comment or database comment column.

But look at Scott Meyer's use of local static 1) as singleton and 2) to control initialization order.

look at sizeof() in sfinae. Alexandrescu justified this sizeof usage.

Look at other TMP techniques that exploit compiler rules to the fullest.
====new: boxer cornered n beaten
OK you thought you were a good boxer. Now you are pushed to the corner of the ring and taking a severe beating. Can you fight your way out?

In the past I could often fight my way out. Not in GS. I was beaten and beaten and beaten.. like a boxer in the corner. I was challenged to deliver, GTD... My self-esteem as a strong techie took a brutal beating. I was "shown" weaker than many techies in the team or the department .. "Look at what they did to Victor .. Horrific.. Savage.. Carnage".

In terms of theoretical knowledge or innovative design I might be somewhat stronger than some peers but I was cornered on brown-field..

The damage can be destructive -- it destroys your self-confidence, self-esteem, self-worth

I had another one (smaller-scale) at Stirt.

Always brown field, localSys, GTD, figure-things-out, coworker benchmark

--employee vs contractor
As a contractor, I would quit, if they don't let me go.

Also, as a contracotr, they could just wait for my contract to end. They don't have an obligation to help me "improve". The PIP is the beating.

The bonus serves as a humiliation. 

--trapped due to visa and no internal transfer .. "cornered" and nowhere to hide. 
This only happened to me at GS. I think this factor increased by (50% to) 100% the severity of the destructive damage.

How about the first Deepak@RTS? I think he suffered a beating and had to leave for his own sanity. He relied on his interview skills.
 
--put up a good fight and exit
I did that in Macq but at GS I was tied down and took a brutal beating.

Look at Jack Z at MS. Probably trapped in the same way.

--green field ... was my relative strength 
The beating was more on brown-field. 

In Macq, green-field also suffered a beating.
