-- new or fuxi: Why ibanks "support" bccy
Ibank's advertized business model is client facilitation. 
Ibanks may hold an inventory of popular bccy, and may also accept service fee payment in bccy. In such a scenario, the ibank would trade bccy for its own position, even though the claim to trade bccy only for hedging. 

In other words, ibanks are dealers rather than pure-play brokers.

Prop trading is a secret business model of ibanks.

-- new: 20 shouts: sofa passive resistance
on 29 May, mom was mopping the floor and need to move a sofa. Boy was sitting on it and refused to stand up. Dad politely asked and offered to help pull him up, but boy slapped on dad's helping hand. Mom then gave him 3 seconds to stand up but boy refused to stand up.

I don't know what boy did during the 30min sitting outside the glass door.

If boy didn't do anything as promised, then this is a waste of dad's time and company staff's time, a punishable offense.

I feel tag proliferation is worse. Some tags would lose sunshine and lose relevance.

-- new: scale-out favored by the propaganda
The propaganda, the simplistic view favors scale-out. However, scale-out can underperform.

similarly, multithreaded qsort can be slower than single-threaded. 

The paper on COST (Configuration that Outperforms a Single Thread) asserts that 
The unoptimized implementation "scales" far better, despite (or rather, because of) its inferior performance. 

The COST of a given platform for a given problem is the count of cpu cores required before the platform outperforms an optimized single-threaded implementation.

The COST can be hundreds of cores. A given scale-out platform may require that many cores to beat a single-threaded implmenetation. If you grow an army of shrimps against a whale in a tug-of-war, you need an army of millions.

--update zero sum game
bccy and gold are zero sum games by definition since there's no income generated. 
However, gold is natural inflation-hedge. Since our accounting currency is a fiat currency, gold is hopefully better than a zero-sum game, only over the long-term.
