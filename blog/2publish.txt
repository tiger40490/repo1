--new: ##reasonable, non-essential, addictive foods
For these foods, most of us mere mortals find the wrong-quantity temptation challenging, so I would say "Stay as far away from these foods as possible". 

However, it could be harsh and unrewarding to stay away for too long. I endorse periodic abstinence. I practiec it on ice cream. 

rice
nuts
century eggs
bread with nuts or other plant produce, but without cream
? creamy cakes? not reasonable, usually bad for health
? ice cream
? hummus? Not so addictive

--new: buying small packets of nuts
Nuts are OK but not essential 

Slowly get into the habit of eating/buying small packet of nuts. This is based on an honest assessment of my limited self-restraint

--new: increase tolerance for raw veg #deeper-green
The higher my tolerance for raw veg, without any taste-enhancer, the better my chance of long-term health. 
The higher my tolerance for home yoga practice without any help, the better my chance of long-term health

higher tolerance = deeper-green zone.

Caution -- if i can tolerate the extreme form of diet and celebrate it too explicitly, then I develop a negative perception of the less extreme yet worthwhile diets like fruits

Eg: raw celery and carrot without any dressing
Eg: Sat morning yoga on hard surface .. is extreme, and when I decide to go realYoga studio I felt like a weakling
Eg: no movie for a year .. is extreme. When I decide to use movie as a reward I hear a nagging zsms
