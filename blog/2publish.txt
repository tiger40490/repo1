Some sectors have deep pockets but somewhat unattractive, unglamorous among SWEs, so those SWE with such a domain experience tend to command a salary premium.

Oil-n-gas is one example
Hedge fund .. perceived as unstable
Finance in genneral .. perceived as backward and laggard
government .. is NOT

In a "normal" job, I would feel that "mainstream tech/dnlg" as a factor is like 15% vs 25% for salary+benefits

-- new: scored better in math than B.Engin
In MSFM, I scored mostly A and two B's, based on exams or group assignments.

In B.Engin, I scored a few C or D.

I have no reason to suspect the grading criteria to be stricter in either program.
I assume the bell curve grading is similar in both programs. 
My class cohort is stronger in ... MSFM.

Among SWEs, I'm one of the strongest in math, having a math masters.

-- new: hear both sides@story, or get brainwashed
Our judgement of morality, character... etc is subject to brainwash.
* eg: my son's opinion of CCP
* eg: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Catch_a_Predator
* eg: https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=6980&action=edit

We need to read the criticisms, counter arguments, both sides of the story.

-- new: %%prejudie: China's innovation
I have a growing prejudice that China is a immitator, follower not an innovator as Americans and Europeans are. But consider

* 拿来主义 is positive attitude. A country too arrogant to 放下身段 and adopt other cultures will pay a price and decline.
* Japan is the first Asian country to open up and reform to adopt western systems ...
* The west also picked up many things from India, East Asian cultures...

Math (and comp science to some extent) .. China didn't invent any, but China students have very strong foundations.

-- update https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=41605&action=edit.. borrowed book vs bought vs free books

Borrowed books exert the highest time-pressure, even if I am allocated 6 weeks.

Purchased books generate the heaviest stress in terms of "reading minutes vs $cost". However, an even bigger stressor is the carry-cost when moving home. Each time I had to go through dozens deciding which titles to discard. Always painful and time-consuming.

Free books are stress-free. Free magazines often show quality content esp. in the case of a global publication brand.

-- new: dental self-care: unconventional wisdom
I would say regular check-up is crucial for me. It is an external dependency, but it can help me monitor and early-detect any "unapproved habit" as listed in this bpost. I would feel confident if regular check-up doesn't reveal any weakness in my habits.

I brush at most once a day, at night, even though some people advocate twice or after-every-meal.

I use inter-dental brush rather than floss threader. 

I use double-floss handle, rather than regular floss.

I re-use a floss, inter-dental or brush for years, rather than change-every-3M

Meaningfully Reward myself for starting the process earlier in the year. The earlier the better.

-- new: check a commit is already in master
The problem: when a branch is merged into master, a brand new hash would be generated. 

So we can't look for the hash of the original commit. Instead, we can use a combination of {commit msg, timestamp, committer}. These items are preserved by the merge engine.

If these things match between 2 commits, then there's basically no chance they are actually different.

git log | grep -B3 'the needle commit msg'

-- new: deepcopy
copy.deepcopy() is never quizzed, but is a key ECT feature in CIV. It's fairly easy to use, and seldom involves any surprises, tweaking or troubleshooting.

Once a while, we can showcase our python expertise by drawing attention to deepcopy. It solves two common problems of object graph cloning, using a memo object.

Deepcopy is somewhat related to serializer "pickle" module.

Your class can implement def __deepcopy__(self, memo). In it, you can deep clone a componentA using deepcopy(componentA, memo).

Standard module doc is concise and readable.

-- update ITC
Inter-thread-communication can use an atomic var. Usually a very simple type like bool or short integer.

EffectiveModernC++ has an example.

AtomicRef is a wrapper over a pointer that supports CAS?

-- new: background heat: car ownership considered harmful
classic background heat is invisible stress of some large difficult project like Quarz, annual tax filing,,,

The current trigger: Singapore consumer education promotes public transport, walk, cycle, rather than private cars.

The (mental) wellness impact, and to a lesser extent the eco factor, are (harmful) "background heat" -- a home-grown term not laden with meanings).

Some frequent drivers (7+ trips/wk) may pass all health screenings. If you are one of them, you may not care about the backgroune heat. 
You may feel your "system" can cope with the harmful background heat.
However, over decades the heat tend to grow /heavier/, less negligible, and accmulate an enduring/permanent effect on a person's life chances and well-being.

-- new: triple trip2fetch phone left@home: +ve perception
Today I left my mobile phone at home, so I came to office and quickly decided to go back and fetch it. 
A few years ago in the same situation, I used to feel bitter/resentful because I focused on the negative side:
* family members unable to help me... no obligation
* I would have to pay a few dollars for commute 
* I have just arrived in office and have not done any work
* I must return to office (rather than working from home) due to a meeting [PMA walk through]
* I will miss a 3pm meeting, though I could try to dial in during my commute

Just 2 or 3 items were enough to paint the whole thing bloody. Instead, this time I focused on the positive elements:
* my workload is low, without urgent deliverables
* my work hours are flexible
* my commute is rather short, with minimal walk on both ends
* I could read on the train, with a seat (offpeak hours)

This is a simple and powerful illustration of positive perception.

~~ Citi JE branch visit
I was feeling bitter about the wasted trip, but hey, I was free on that day, and wanted to explore.

I had a valid reason to visit it. On such trips, there's always a probability of "waste". It's like market risk.

-- new or update bpost on quality time.. Every family outing must count
Almost everyone involved is busy and each has to make adjustments to make it happen.

For years, I resented the huge hours lost after a movie -- time spent shopping or at nearby playgrounds. I realized that after a family movie, I should go straight home.
Then in 2022 I slowly changed my behavior. After a Stadium trip, we spent hours in Decathlon. 
Around Christomas 2022, we went to IMM to buy a pair of shoes but spent 5 - 8 hours there ! Still regretful but less painful.

13 Nov family outing trip was very low productivity, "rot". 
Somehow I avoided the burn-rot trap of self-hate. 
I used to be a hostage. The high standad of productivity was simply unrealistic with family outing. 

In contrast, I think a corporate team-building event could be (would be) benchmarked for efficiency, but that's for the organizer. 
Most participants would be too relaxed and fail the benchmark. 
Family members are more like the participants rather than the organizers.
