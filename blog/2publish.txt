--new blogpost: predicted saving/burn-rate
Q: prediction: my visible burn rate including mindchamps without tax without air-tickets? 5k, excluding anything from wife's account
saving rate target after allowance payout: 5k. Be kind to yourself. 

Both targets are useful and valuable. but we need different attitudes towards each.

I'm generally competent at saving but stress can still happen

--new blogpost: parents' discretionary spend 
Many fellow parents (plan to) spend disproportionately on their kids because .. they want-to not pressured-to. Chinese parents feel good about martyrdom -- saving up and investing on kids education. 

Labor of love... However, Some (33 to 50%) of my peers appear to be under pressure to put up such huge amounts, due to peer pressure and societal expectation like a "norm".

How am I different?
I don't plan to spend on branded college, so there's a 50/50 chance I won't start saving until 4Y before college
I don't want to spend on luxury vacations as an "education" -- unnecessary and too costly
I do consider taking lower jobs to spend more time with kids.
I want to spend huge amount to cut my commute so I can spend more time with kids
I plan to spend on kids' non-academic pursuits, as Jenny on swimming, piano, coding, camps

--new: cake: better buy small slice
big ice-cream/cake is cheaper but more damaging than small slices.

Small slice is expensive but relieves me of the struggle, pain and guilt of overeating.

My last experience – big slice of choco cake from CakeHistory … unable to leave half to next day

--new: strategic needs a re-definition
jolt
(I used to update this thing in gmail or blog directly)

"Strategic" needs a re-definition. quant and c# were two wake-up calls that I tragically missed.

For a long time, the #1 strategic t-expense was quant, then c#/c++QQ, then codingDrill (the current yellowJersey).

Throughout 2019, I considered workout time as inferior to coding drill .. Over weekends or evenings I often feel nothing-done even though I push myself to do "a bit of" yoga, workout, or math-with-boy, exp tracking, 

Now I feel yoga and other fitness t-spend is arguably more strategic than tech muscle building. I say this even though fitness improvement may not last.
Fitness has arguably the biggest impact on brain health and career longevity
