-- new: ##ways@link`blogposts
Linking in my blog is high-value and high-tcost. We need Continuous Process Improvement. There are currently 3 ways to link 2 "related" blogposts.

* categories and tags .. their proliferation breeds confusion, artificial complexities..

* links of various forms
** opaque URL
** slug URL
** "see also the blogpost on xxx"
** underlined phrase

When I feel the need for two-way linking, I often merge the two posts into one big post.

* a big blogpost with multiple sections cross-referencing. I think it's OK to have two big separate sections, possibly overlapping. No need to consolidate.
** There are often memorable alias posts pointing to such a big blogpost.

I always brought study material + other reading materials.

Nowadays I worry less about opening hours because I could sit in bus interchange with A/C + free wifi. 
I fee lucky to have the library, the free wifi in various locations, the laptop, git-blogg infrastructure. 
Adaptation (see the blogpost) and resilience.

Nowadays I mostly use therapeutic blogging to recover, restore, calm down, regain focus. 
Maybe I should start using more study materials for zqbx, for burn. Get on the offensive?

It is also similar to my yoga practice. Now I share my yoga story with so many friends, as inspiration

How did I overcame the inertia on tax filing, ..

-- j4 wpress course
The wpress course is heavy on page look-n-feel customization.
I hate this aspect and would not make good progress without this course.

I already spent real money on dhost. This is one way to leverage on that. I can set up multiple subdomains each for a landing page. My advantage over other newbies.

I already spent huge effort learning wpress. this is one way to leverage on that.

wpress has many books in library. Am good at learning from books.
