--update bpost on features of epaJob
Some poeple don't need these "features", but I really enjoy my commute + EPA flexible hours ... I can work during quiet times (weekends, evenings) and take hours and hours off during the day.

Pretty rare among the jobs known to me.

-- update post on array^ptr
a ptr Object can be reseated to point to an array.
An arrayName (is not an object) can't be reseated. It's a compile-time constant.

-- new or fuxi: java: big lambdaEx^methodRef
I think a big lambdaEx (lambda expression) is usually used as an argument to a method. 

Q: can we convert the big lambdaEx to a method reference?
A: not alwaysl. In Dropcopy framework, I realized that 

* many times yes I can and should convert. LambdaEx is designed for small code blocks.
* however, if the lambdaEx uses captured variables, then conversion can be difficult. I think the new method has to add a new param for every captured variable.

-- fuxi or update bpost on deep work
Learning something "strategic" is real work.
eg: Learning for a meaningful school exam is strategic -- NUS? MSFM?
eg: Coding drill is strategic and deep work.

Some learning can be less "real". Same can be said of various paid projects. In the DeepWork context, I won't use an elaborate criteria for "real" work.

-- update bpost on miles, ..
Somehow, MLP likes to retrench old timers !

-- update bpost on C
I often feel proud to say C was my first language.
Similarly, I feel proud to self-identify as a math graduate.

These domains are evergreen in terms of relevance and skill demand. 
Somehow my career[and learning] gravitates towards these /magnets/.

-- fuxi or update pff complexities 
If you feel too old or too busy, and don't want these pff complexities, then you pay for advice from banks or financial advisors.
Rarely you get free advisory service (remember FSM and Phillip) but often during the sale process only.

-- fuxi: use both k_twister_SMS and t_selfTalk .. a new model for overlap-tagging
Better than two overlapp tags (ugly proliferation)

Need an explanation bpost .. perhaps use one of the t_selfTalk bposts.

-- "fuxi x 2" means Dram refreshed twice
