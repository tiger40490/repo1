--new: big$: contract^FTE
some reasons that contract rate can exceed FTE base

* contract rate can be adjusted down. If employer feels this rate is too high, they can let it expire. (Many of my peers don't like it but I don't mind.) FTE base can't be so high due to lack of flexibility to bring it down.
* there's no need to benchmark high contract rate against manager's pay. Therefore, high rate is easier to approve.
* There's also some bonus component in a FTE position. It is in the employer's equation, but is heavily discounted in my equation.

To hit highest salary leveraging my IV skill, how high can I hit as FTE? Capped by managers and also very hard to meet expectations once hired. However, contract is much easier -- outperform other candidates and I deliver for a year. Bye-bye.

--update blogpost on boxer
My PWM period saw the deadliest stress in my life, because I had to fight not only for my self-esteem, but for the family's "one-n-only" chance in the U.S. 
I felt if i couldn't survive at GS I would have to give up U.S. forever, and never have a 2nd chance in the U.S. 

(Only after a year , at end of 2010, did I decide to bring family back to SG.)

The burden on my shoulder was crushing. I could barely breathe!

At that stage, only one manager's assessment was at play, but I didn't know it. I was brainwashed to believe that my performance was rated below-the-bar by everyone.

--new: good at pushing myself
am good at pushing myself to the limit, sometimes beyond my limit, even if i may not be "good at" them in a competitive sense.
* yoga
* jogging
* coding drill
* camp out

coding drill is the most interesting case study. Other people may complete more problems, but i probably spend more time
* Ranked by number of problems, i'm just average
* ranked by hours spent, I'm much higher
* ranked by effort, I'm even higher, as I push myself harder than others

I think the boss wants to let him go but may feel merciful, so they keep him but give him shitty tasks and demand fast turnaround at good quality.... unreasonable/unfair workload.

A small number of old timers change job but some regret as new job turns out worse. 
Other old timers hear those war-stories and prefer the certainty of known pain in the current job. They don't feel confident they can find a better job.

Many older timers can't afford bench time due to low reserve and high burn rate. 
Old timers tend to be very used to stable income. 
Damien of Macq relied on his bonus payout.. 
Davis had no savings at all.

Most older timers won't take on a 6M contract.

Most older timers will never consider a voluntary pay cut

some older timers worry about job loss so much that they work their ass off to keep the job, even if the workload is unreasonable/unfair. I think in GS I was like them .
Some old timers have a wife who completely opposes job change due to potential impact on family.

Q: why XR and I can afford to quit a job, stay home, and find a lower job? 
A: Supportive wife, burn rate, passive income and savings.

--new: contract rate is not benchmarked against FTE
If my contract rate is higher than FTE team members, we explain that it's not comparable as my employer gets a cut and I also pay more taxes and have no benefits like paid leaves.

If my contract rate is lower than FTE team members, then we often say it's due to market rate. Not sure why, but I don't feel inferior. 

This factor becomes crucial in a PIP situation. The FTE victim would get a donut bonus and donut raise, and her base would fall below some very junior team members .. unbearable humiliation. 
No such humiliation on a non-performing contractor even if his rate is below a grad. Nobody cares about the benchmark.
