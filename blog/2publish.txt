--new blog:
I was able to move between countries and between industries, primarily based on interview skill. We can't rely on GTD, localSys..

--new: job search SG still slower than NY
I didn't try the ibank jobs...
Singapore tech shops are mostly not keen about my profile
Singapore fintech shops ? no interest shown.

--update blogpost on survivor
I more than survived at Macq in first year, with a bonus
I did survive at Stirt by recovering from PIP and earning a meet/meet

My sampling technique was biased, statistically. I didn't count the number of times I survived layoff:
* GS during GFC
* OC through the transfer
* Stirt through the meet/meet
* Macq through the transfer

My perception of each entire period was tainted -- "once I got a PIP, all subsequent positive evidence is negligible."
