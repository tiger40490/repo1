--new (soul-search): superior absorbency domains
When in sky-high absorbency, I should try and take on the really tough. When in "good" absorbency, I should take on the medium tough jobs.

Compare to my peers, I have superior Long-term absorbency on these specific challenges:
* jogging, but not stretching
* push-up but not chin-up
* QQ study but not coding drill -- major competition
* eating raw veg but not celery
* delaying meals but not reducing dinner

These long-term absorbency advantages are life-enhancing, too put it mildly


--new: selective listen` j4
Selective listening is not so wrong. We need selective listening. Some information, tips, suggestions, facts-n-figures do more harm than good to us. Our mind is not so strong so rational, therefore it can be polluted, influenced... 

One eg is the Internet millionaire on youtube. I used to say "even though I hate his face he might be a good guy just too polished." I used to dismiss my more cynical Chinese friends as prejudiced, opinionated .... until Hongzhi told me some Eric was a 骗子. Then I met another in my very first public speech given at Woodlands library, to 20 interested investors.

I now tune in to my first impressions, my instincts and my gut feelings, even though they are not fair, balanced at all. If I always suspend these unfounded assessments, I would listen to hoaxes all the time.

--Q: if I declare a huge int array in static memory, will the object file become huge?

This is possibly a QQ nlg pearl, a halo zbs, not GTD
