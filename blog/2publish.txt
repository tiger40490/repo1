--new blogpost swap usage when RAM adequate
Adapted from blog by Hayden James

Even when our avarage memory usage is smaller than RAM capacity, system still benefits from swap. 

Most servers are daemons. Any daemon can create memory pages rarely accessed till shutdown
Kernel often decides to relocate rarely sed memory pages to swap for performance reasons, mostly to free up RAM.
The reclaimed RAM space can remain vacant for some time, 
so you may think the relocation is unnecessary but ..
* the relocation is usually harmless -- 
the kswap pid uses very little cpu unless such relocation workload becomes frequent and bidirectional, a sign of insufficient RAM. 
* the relocation is preemptive. 
The vacant RAM is available to any process that can use it more productively. In general, faster cache ought to hold "hotter" data

Many of the top factors are "perceptions" rather than "hardships"

perceptions -- seld-esteem@comp; strategic tsn; engaging. #best eg@perception -- peer comparison
hardships -- mkt depth; workload; family time; commute

Polish 2-4 projects and list them on a blogpost. I can send the list or the blogpost.

Tcost needs to be controlled according the value. There's learning value when I polish my code.

Optionally, restrict read access. I think restriction is not really worthwhile. Hiring teams may "explore" my github beyond my featured projects but they don't know who wrote them or why. I would guess these interviewers are too busy.
