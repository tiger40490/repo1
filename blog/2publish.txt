--new: 12M-delay(!!repeat)in SG school 
if we need to quit US and return to SG, we don't need to see it as losing a million dollars. We can consider an international school, or get boy to join a JC as an older student. Remember HJC classmate Zhong Xiong.

Some China students join a U.S. school as an older student so they don't get bullied, and more mature against bad influences.

I too was delayed for 1.5 years but excelled in HJC. I accepted it very grudgingly. My parents were unashamed, unapologetic.

I also had many NUS classmates a few years older than the majority.

..consider IB school for boy
earmark 30k/Y tuition

Once he leaves the public school system, he can't come back!

bring boy to visit some of them? He may prefer an IB school to a public school !

If I lose my MLP job, I have 3M of compensation but I would need to immediately start the U.S. relocation. Boy would have little choice but move to U.S.

--new jolt: ## still commiting old mistakes: fixation on benchmarks
I still benchmark boy with "China students" and the academic kids, ignoring his self-benchmark
I still commit the CSY mistake of comparing college branding, ignoring..
I still focus too much on pattern recognition, ignoring...
I still focus too much on efficiency in his homework, ignoring ... Actually most kids at this age are inefficient.
I still compare him to myself in math, ignoring his superior standard in science etc
I still compare him to myself in absorbency, ignoring his talent in inter-personal etc
I still base my reward/discipline on peer comparison
I still base my reward/discipline on effort. Hiring mgr often tells inteviewee "if you can finish your work well you can come late and leave eary". 

--new: fine for lost items
When an item is misplaced and unfound over 3 days, the first time fine will be 10x the price.
If something is lost 2nd time, double the fine to 20x
For 3rd time, double the fine to 40x
Get him to agree.

Good to post it on fridge for a few day.. but not necessary

--new: stationeries as reward for boy
he won't use them, but these are better than unhealthy foods

expensive, harmless foods are fine too. I think stationeries are slightly more memorable.
usb fan too -> up in wardrobe

Q: approx ranking of best spend by/on boy for a $10
stationeries as toys
fancy fruits
fancy meat + fish
drinks to be given away
small toys
Chinese books? 
vacation? but high tcost

--new: signs of early give-up
Q: what are the signs that he is giving up too early, and what are the "opposite" signs that he has tried enough but had no good clue?
A: concentration

Q: what are his signs of fatigue?
Remember I also have fatigue with many practice subjects such as trigo

--new: low latency: avoid dynamic data structures
RTS uses no STL containers.

In my first programing job, I used C without malloc, because I used only array + struct. If my collection were to grow at run time, then I would have needed DAM. 

I feel low latency generally avoid mid-day DAM. If DAM required, then pre-allocation is preferred.
