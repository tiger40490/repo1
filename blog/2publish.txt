--each time I lose temper (yelling) or break my promise, boy can point out and I will pay a fine to grandpa's account, with up to 20% of the fine going to boy's account

To be effective, this has to be printed or reviewed with boy.

Smashing without yelling... possible? Buy or (pick up) some plastic utensils.
