-- update: jenkins 
.. is like IDE skill (including git) -- non-trivial, with some GTD value but zero QQ value, never quizzed
This perception can have a poisonous effect on my localSys xx motivation.
-- new: OC bond mufu
Why the OC mufu is not something to buy-n-hold?
One reason is expRatio. Is there some long-term trend? I don't see it.

-- update bpost on bpost proliferation
.. My adaptations to the proliferation problem:
more deletion of outdated bposts
git blogging now uses more Update less New
more time spent on fuxi using PubDate adjustment and less time spent creating new bposts
more comments in bpost titles.. In some cases, post title, tag/category are more impotant than the (brief) post content
"fuxi" entries in git blog .. see bpost
