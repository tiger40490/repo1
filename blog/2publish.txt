perhaps it would be more effective to develop some Deep hobbies early in life, such as writing, playing pop songs, yoga, painting,
It requires strategic planning and heavy investment

-- update bpost on hotline annoyances
Starhub port-in issues ... rather than bitterness I could and should feel grateful and lucky to get the answers from the PlazaSing staff.

1 Oct 1am HSBC FAST down time .. instead of disappointment, I should feel lucky to hear the clear answer about 1-7.30am. Also, I was lucky to hear a complete answer from the SCB lady, and lucky to avoid any SCB lock-out.

-- update or new: threading in c++ less popular than in java
Concurrency dev is difficult, in both design and the basic building blocks as language constructs. Java makes it easier, much easier than pthreads and std::thread. It is so easy that java interviews routinely include some concurrency questions.

Factor: the c++ shops I try are all trading shops. They choose c++ for latency. To optimize latency, STM is best, rather than multi-threading. So I think their c++ threading questions are light.

-- new: GPT
application domains of GPT:

language translation 
document summarization 
designing visuals, 
making animations, 
researching complex topics

How slow is the training? As of 2023, hundreds of billions of Words would take months using supercomputers. Fine-tuing often takes days on smaller computers.

Fine-tuning means ... writing instruction/goodOutput and feeding them.

GPT models generate text in casual, humorous, professional,,,, styles.

Educators can use GPT-based software to generate learning materials such as quizzes and tutorials. Similarly, they can use GPT models to evaluate the answers.

-- update [18]proof-of-work ] blockchain
Proof@Stake
Q: what if a big "shareholder" of a ABC coin mishandles a validation, and adds a bad block to the ABC blockchain? 

Does she earn the "gas" before or after the bad data is uncovered?  If "after", then bad data is included in the ABC block chain for at least some time, and during that period, unlimited number of subsequent blocks could go into the blockchain, leading to a mess. So I will assume answer is "before". 

So technically, how can the "second validation" take place in real time? If it is straightforward to detect a bad block, then the first validator would always do it automatically, and there would be no risk of losing your stake. In such a case, every participant would stake 100% of their coins each time. That means the biggest "shareholder" would keep getting richer, and richer.

I believe it's not straightforward to detect a bad block produced by the first validator. That leads to a can of worms.

Suppose there's a dispute... someone disputes a past transaction on the blockchain. Who has authority to question the first validator? Who would be the judge? I think real power ultimately lies with the founders and the software developers. This is not decentralized concensus-building.


-- new or update: detect stuck thread in a pool
weblogic marks a pooled thread as stuck if it is busy for 10min (configurable). Weblogic is designed for a large patient queue, so each patient should not take 10min.
Purpose of detection is not per-patient intervention. Purpose is hospital mgmt such as thread pool config, memory increase, or load balancing.

For a custom application, this doesn't work. A thread can be busy and productive for any amount of time.

-- new or update on signal+socket
signals in windows? not popular

real time signals are a new Posix concept... not really low-latency. 
Low latency sockets don't rely on signals for immediate action

Many signals are self-sent from the same process. I think timer alarm is one example. Sockets signal is another example. However, keyboard signals like Ctrl-C are not self-sent.

Signal is designed to be asynch, seldom immediate, though the scheduler may preempt whatever is running and give the next time slice to the signal's target process sooner than normal.

One of the most common signals is SIGSEGV. The default signal handler function performs a core dump. There's no process to preempt. However, the current process may not check its signal table until some instructions later, and then run the signal handler.

-- new: don't offend criminals
Most criminals won't rob a random stranger.

Criminals would hurt or kill for even a small amount if they feel justified.

If you owe them money
If you steal even a single dollar from them
If you cheat them or short-change them
If you show them disrespect, they would feel justified to hurt or even kill

-- update bpost on family counsell 
Advantage of CGC counselling -- counsellor has access to boy's data and has seen him about 3 times.
insurance coverage

consider for-profit counsellor for parenting, diet and other things.

Diet counselling need to be an element due to insurance.
Parenting counselling is a key element as my wife may also need to join me.

I think wife's need is more critical. In contrast, I have a support network already.

-- new: minimize diagnosis psychiatry
Diagnosis has a commercial dimension. It helps with insurance claim.
In some countries, some practitioners are "ready" with a diagnosis.

My focus in this bpost is Singapore.
Some private clinics are more willing to give diagnosis. 
IMH has a policy to minimize diagnosis.

I told Cigna that 1)I need a diagnosis for reimbursment 2) I hate the labeling of the diagnosis.

If you do get a label, you need to be careful about the label

Now that IMH has no formal ODD diagnosis, I feel free to use the ODD term loosely.
