--new: amidst the demands, focus on protecting
protect my precious job -- the numerous precious features
protect family harmony -- boy's PSLE is one of the biggest threats
protect my current wellness condition -- diet, exercise, dental,,, demands time + absorbency

For the above protections, I'm willing to spend more money (not tcost) like tutors, nearby family outings (tcost)

? protect my carefree cash-flow -- the BGC situation is not yet carefree
? protect my interview readiness? I think I will NOT lose it so soon.

--update blog on mlp advantage
luckily many of my coworkers are not so dedicated
luckily, if in the mood, I can go work for a few hours at any time

--update blogpost on long^short horizon
Long-horizon prospect is fundamentally connected to current pains such as time mgmt, mtv,,, Accepting the former should help me accept the latter.

The more completely I accept the former, the more it would help me coping with the current pains.

--new: exam:#1strategic subject #M^C
Chinese -- because in the U.S. there's no environment.

English? No. he may grow up an untrained writer but he will be proficient in English as an everyday language. Grammar, vocab will be fine.

Math -- he needs foundation skills. I feel his foundation is sound so far, though his don't-care attitude is indistinguishable from a weak foundation.

--new jolt: time spent blogg`about boy=therapeutic
Time spend blogging about boy is therapeutic. 

Also, the time spent preparing his math worksheet is therapeutic -- a landed punch; am able to focus, calm down and make (albeit slow) progress; gaining traction rather than wheel-spinning

I'm good at these even though they take up huge amount of energy and precious quiet time.
Luckily I don't feel worn out by these efforts.

I feel at my age, parenting IS a main job, comparable to my day job. 
Actually, Career progression is NOT my main responsibility at this stage of my life.

--new: better blog post titles:
catchy phrases
sharp questions

It requires time and mental energy to create and improve blog titles. 
Effective titles help organize my thoughts on a complex and challenging subject such as parenting or diet. 
Such a subject may grow to 200 blogposts, so without effective organization lots of content become effectively lost.

--new: effective text highlighting in git-blog etc
* most versatile is __connected_underline__
* color, bold, font size, strike-through
* underline -- confusing (hyperlink)
* italics -- hardly noticeable on its own. Need to combine with other highlighting
