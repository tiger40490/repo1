-- update bpost on PMA
PMA has non-trivial complexity and functionality but is low-maintenance. A rare gem of quality and well-designed enterprise software.

However, it does require the app owner to be pro-active in learning the internals. 

New support staff would need logs + DB read access + documentation.

eg: company provides standing desk to everyone. Sometimes I use it once a week, but the gap between usage can grow to a few months. Yet it's still worthwhile.
eg: we bought dozens of books from China and positioned them in "prime" locations. Kids pick up one book in a year. Perhaps not worth it
