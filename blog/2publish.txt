-- new: double_income=their only advantage over me
my recurring sentiment about my US cmc peers
Most of my U.S. cmc peers have double income, well above me in terms of household income.

Now I feel that's about the only advantage they have over me. 

wellness .. am better than majority of them
family harmony .. they are not better. Look at my bonding with my kids
marriage .. mine is more stable than many of them including those divorced
edu credentials .. mine is higher than most of them
long-term financial support by the state .. my gov is better than theirs by a large margin
pff .. despite their much higher income, I don't feel they are actually better off. This is just like latency race .. what's enough?

-- new: unstable marriage of two high flyers
Q: given the cashflow high ground, how could H.Yi improve their marriage and communication.

A: professional couple counselling. This service costs a lot in the U.S.
A: hire a maid to reduce the home-making workload on each parent

Perhaps emmigrate to a lower-income country where systems are less complex and everyday life simpler and more convenient.

Suprisingly, the high ground doesn't provide enough of a buffer of protection against marital risks. The high ground improves risks related to family cashflow, but the high-earning wife is also very independent and doesn't want to play a supporting role to the husband. Not a risk factor in itself, but in some cases, this can indirectly create new risks. Many divorce cases involve two high-income earners.

A lower-class stable couple (earning 100k/Y) look at the higher-class the Yi's with envy. But would the Yi's envy the stable marriage of the lower-class couple? I think Yi's xpSelf would. 

Now 100k/Y is well above the median household income, so why would this couple still envy the Yi's. Would a $400k couple envy someone still higher? It's endless like the low-latency arms race.

-- new: Beijing population #ring roads
Beijing population: 22Mil
Slightly over half the population live outside 5th ring road.

As of 2015, 
the belt between 3rd and 6th road has 12Mil residents.
the belt between 4th and 6th road has 9Mil+ residents.

resources are concentrated in the more mature estates (more central) so the rEstate value should remain.

-- update: def@success? 
each time I feel lucky cf my peers (same or different age), the trigger is usually 
* comp + benefits
* workload
* low stress, low politics
* investment gains including rEstate
* welfare .. quality healthcare at affordable cost (or free as in Canada)
* low tax .. wealth tax
* low inflation, strong currency
* my edu credentials .. ascent of NUS
* moat, career longevity
* really nice wellness facilities near office or home

.. Basicaly the successC components. Similarly, each sinking exprience has a trigger event in pff, brank, double-income, academic kids, WCBA,,,

Jolt: There are more important tectonic plates, but no peer-comparison -- wellness, family harmony [marriage], long-living parents, successZ, recreations, engaging job,,,

-- new: Y insist on touchscreen for next laptop
Touchscreen is a proven productivity feature. 

Q: Since I don't want to pay for cpu, memory etc, what harewre feature am I willing to pay for? 
A: Touchscreen + screen size! 

for the tiny laptop, touch-screen is less valuable
usage is usually short-duration (below an hour in myst instances).

However, when using the tiny laptop in office, the touch-screen convenience might help me avoid sending emails out of MLP

-- new: killer talent, or update bpost on personal adv
More than once I imagine that an individual is really mediocre except in one thing, and on that one thing he/she makes a comfortable living, possibly supporting a family. 
By "mediore" I mean this person is below average on many important things and barely above average on others.

celebrities are the most visible example -- commercially very successful based on one killer talent, but I have to exclude them for this characterization to be relevant to me.

Leaders [most managers] are by definition multi-talented.

I'm good at JIV, but it is simplistic (and unfair) to say I'm barely above average in my studies, wellness, pff, marriage, bonding with my kids,,

I think speed coding could be a killer talent... useful in CIV, irrelevant on the job.

How about piano teaching? Note piano skill can't provide a livelihood, but piano teaching can.
How about math tution?

-- update tiny Lifestyle 升?
My lotus@mrt practice is improving.
I now sit on a plastic bag, so my pants are well-protected and my worry and suspicion about invisible dirt is significantly reduced.
I stitched my pockets to be handphone-friendly
I can now jog in many simple shoes, or barefoot
I can now use stairs, lunges, skip rope
I now use more of thin bar, yoga block, exercise mat

-- update public ivies
Larry has higher income than me. He really likes OhioState for both his kids. Ken (manager of the RTS client-side dev team) .. also sent his kids to a state university, citing cost as one factor.

So why would an immigrant insist on the ivy league?

Larry can afford private colleges, but I feel he didn't see the justification for the higher cost.

Many things are not-absolutely-necessary rather than "unnecessary".

-- new: scientific claim: TCM, yoga 
Science theories are always refutable; non-scientific theories are often non-refutable.
I always believed TCM is proven over centuries but how about lianhua qingwen? 
It is probably proven effective at treating symptoms but there is a different acid test on the effectiveness at treating covid infection.

yoga has proven benefits but how it helps me is very hard to prove.
The meditation part is even harder to prove.

-- update portable install
TreeSizeFree portable can't install a ShellEx but it's not really necessary.

-- le2K.Hu: some of the "important" py features IMHO
I don't know if interviewers perceive them as important and worth testing.

* large scale multiprocessing
* compute farm
* decorators
* protocols
* serialization
* hack into the import mechanism
* various introspection techniques

Every time I resolve to invest in python self-study beyond what's required at work, my enthusiasm would die down rather quickly. Why? I always felt the return on investment was unproven. Interviewers may not care about my favorite topics, and work projects are unlikely to need these skills.

NoSql is bigData, not DS/ML. 

Data Science probably favors python or R. ML is even less suitable for java.
ML includes classification, recommendation, ,, NeuralNetwork is part of ML

Chinese immigrants in Canada probably want to work in U.S. just as U.S. tech students want to work in WCBA

-- new English bpost: wellbeing
(Become a referent from the category description)
the concept of wellbeing is academic, and very vague to the layman. 
It's a target of research funding in public policy, healthcare, psychology, sociology, economics, organizational behavior.

It's realted to lifetime satisfaction, life chances...

-- new: weekend office trip=worthwhile even if no work done
even if I don't actually work for more than 2 minutes on a weekend trip to office, it is still a good habit, because the trip creates the oppportunity to work.

Similarly, Parents often buy gears to create the opportunity for their kids to discover a personal interest.

Similarly, I told many friends that I often go to stadium without a target of how much workout I must complete. Instead, I go there to create the opportunity for myself.

Beside work, 
* I get better diet control in office
* I get superior blogg infrastricture
* I could work out in office or outside
* I could call beijing more easily

j4 using multiple browser brands .. if you are comfortable with a single browser brand (say, Chrome) rather than multiple browser brands, then the impact of Chrome issue is more scary, more stressful, requires more painful adjustments.

if I preclear a lot for a day, but later find myself in a power surge for math session or something else, then the pressure to do something about the pre-cleared stock is an unwanted distraction.

-- update commercial rental yield in China vs SG
TPY central shophouse $12k/M rental for a $3.8M (asking) price, about 4%. 
Very good but probably short lease remaining.

-- update sReit
I feel sReit is more transparent than usReit, largely due to the nanny state regulation.

The sReit operators are all well-known. Many of them are government-linked. As such, they are very low-risk in terms of govenance.

There are relatively few variations (a form of cognitive complexity) among the sReits. Very similar business models.

-- fuxi or update post on income/wealth
There are two important quadrants:  HighIncome_LowWealth, and LowIncome_HighWealth

The traditional Chinese tend to save and invest (Earn/Save/Invest) and become fairly wealthy.

-- update stress protection, reduction...
stress buffering is a well-defined term, graphical. It is related to protection and reduction.

-- update git-bash
transparency .. useful even on large screens 
intuitive copy-paste is more important than I thought
right-click to paste. Can be non-intuitive to some, but easy to discover, and easy to learn
shift-insert is a built-in hotkey for paste. Worth learning.

git-diff red_text_on_black is horrible default .. I am trying Dracula. Large text size also helps.

blinking cursor .. block cursor is nicer on my eyes than a thin bar, and a more visual indicator of the window of focus.

After assigning hotkey F2 to SaveAll, we need to identify hotkey conflicts. This is better done using the search bar at bottom of the pop-up.
Without this tool, the conflict used to add to the legwork and pschological stress.

-- update "yoga4life"
at twice a week, the total hours would be 3 to 5 /wk, based on my Bayonne experience. This is much more than the hours I can allocate to all other workouts combined. Therefore, the tcost is unsustainable.

Reality is, yoga isn't life-saving like kidney dialysis that must be performed weekly. Most guys are unable to do 3 sessions/week and therefore 3 sessions/week is unrealistic for most people, just like 5 workouts/week. 

The sustainable tcost has to be based on self-practice.

-- update blogpost on workout priorities https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/10950/bmi-flexible-cre-strength/
.. the need to balance enjoyments with wellness priorities 
some people (mostly men) enjoy muscle training and nothing else .. I think some  Americans do. It can affect BMI and flexibility, two of the most important aspects of wellness. I am unlikely to become bulky, but flexibility is a traditionally neglected area.

some people enjoy jogging and nothing else. It can lead to loss of flexibility and muscle as we age.

Some women do mostly yoga including some limited strength training, so they lack CRE. Therefore, some combine yoga with cardio. 

Ideally, you would want to enjoy a range of workouts, but few individuals are so lucky. For every adult and child, consistent workout is repetitive and requires a lot of effort and absorbency. Team sports and golf are more fun but requires a lot of external help.

t_intro
Why is fitness class easier than self-practice?
Self-practice requires constant SMS, constant motivating (like dRam refresh), constant push beyond the comfort zone. Lots of system2 work.
For example, after a rest we need System 2 to decide when to restart, set a target and keep count.
In a class, we can relax System2 and follow the instructor and other students. System 1 is efficient.

Remember the Bayonne yoga class led by the Russian student? I didn't like her instruction but still I followed.

If it's a video, then I would not be able to "just follow it"

--slow cooking new time won't stand still
The last weekend of Oct 2021, I put in many hours 
* to add visualization
* to add more tests

What's the motivation, j4 and ROTI? I asked the same question about MSFM, C#, Swing, quant self-study, python... I still don't have a good analytical framework. 

Key observation -- time won't stand still. It keeps flowing at a constant rate. Time can't be warehoused. If I don't spend my time on this coding practice, I would easily "waste" it on one of the energy sinks.

This coding drill has multiple benefits in hindsight
* the visualization emboldened me to engage Deepak, Daryl, Josh Lim, even my son. The "engagement" further enhances my "learning" .. various aspects
* my visualization is now barely usable for the "engagement", but if it is unusable, then my effort would still be a worthwhile effort. It reminds me of my pre-sales effort, my self-employment days... 
* I had a blogpost about  weekends otherwise wasted: G3 ROI@UChicago. Even if the code doesn't work, this is still zqbx. Without this zqbx, my ezlife feels decadent, wasteful and an incomplete success. 

My friends' effort and my own effort were not in vein. It restored my self-confidence as a c++ developer. The self-confidence is priceless.

-- slow cooking new: 2022 review on techBets, tsn
Most of my techBets and tsn ... are likely to pay drastically lower dividends after first 10Y. 
(Exceptions are important and include coreJava, c++, unix[power tools, shell scripting])
I will receive the dividend when I change job back to the target domain, be it bondMath, mkt data, sockets, SQL or Perl,,,

Strategic orgro is a holy grail.

We all have to be discretionary, cautious in our positioning.
I spend lots of time blogg about this.

Since 2010s, I have been betting on the growing importance of low-level engineering. It is a common foundation of c++/coreJava/c#. Growing importance yes but didn't translate to growing demand. I guess market depth was underwhelming.

I was betting on SQL and sproc but the demand declined.

Despite the underwhelming results of my techBets and tsn, we must not give up.
Applicable to Singapore government too. 
We need to decide what tech to take up and what to put off.

For the last 15Y, finDev IV is my chose game.
The 3 types of dnlg are still relevant.

I heard a departing colleague's truthful reflections including the reasons for the departure. One of the reasons is related to comp benchmark. I guess (with good level of confidence) that he feels that given his value-add and effort, he should receive $XX more (whatever XX is).

The more one dwells on it, the more one would feel unfair -- Someone else in the same team has the same level of value-add but was rewarded much more.

It's a valuable protection that I don't put in extra effort and sacrifice for the manager. It protects me from the hazard of harmful comparision. If you don't compare, you feel satisfied. If you do, your bubble bursts and derails.

At my age, I don't salary-benchmark as much as in my 30s -- I don't care so much about wasting my potential, my spare capacity. It's good and bad. 

It's bad if I am chronically underpaid (20% below market) like J.Zhang.
It's good if my employer and my manager is generous and keen to retain older SWEs like me.
