I heard a departing colleague's truthful reflections including the reasons for the departure. One of the reasons is related to comp benchmark. I guess (with good level of confidence) that he feels that given his value-add and effort, he should receive $XX more (whatever XX is).

The more one dwells on it, the more one would feel unfair -- Someone else in the same team has the same level of value-add but was rewarded much more.

It's a valuable protection that I don't put in extra effort and sacrifice for the manager. It protects me from the hazard of harmful comparision. If you don't compare, you feel satisfied. If you do, your bubble bursts and derails.

At my age, I don't salary-benchmark as much as in my 30s -- I don't care so much about wasting my potential, my spare capacity. It's good and bad. 

It's bad if I am chronically underpaid (20% below market) like J.Zhang.
It's good if my employer and my manager is generous and keen to retain older SWEs like me.
