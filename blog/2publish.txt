with 6k salary, some exclusive "clubs" would reject my family members -- financially disqualified to enroll

In a slightly similar way, when other kids (wives) can afford something nice but I have to say "We can't afford", it feels just like disqualified...

A slippery slope ! Even though we did quailfy for many "exclusive clubs" like uchicago, SG citizenships, there are always more-exclusive clubs, which would evantualy make everyone in my circle feeling disqualified and bitter
Consider the billionair-below-40 club
