-- link to bpost on China students losing their edge...
Chinese culture (and to some extent Eastern Europe, and East Asia) is more serious than the west about fundamental skills (基本功), stringent, tough training

In terms of sports, China (and those neighbors) are formidable, but not stronger than the west.

In terms of tech innovation, the west still has a better system including their education philosophy/orientation.

In math, things are more nuanced. I don't know why Chinese mathmaticians are not so strong, but quant world has high Chinese representation.

In many engineering/science subjects, students don't need to be as precise as in quant. A 80% grasp is often good enough to get you an A. 

My sister often says her fellow accountants are often focused on precision and missed the big picture priorities. 

There are other competitive domains .. design, architecture, literature, music, visual arts, performance arts, business,

.. is like IDE skill (including git) -- non-trivial, with some GTD value but zero QQ value, never quizzed
This perception can have a poisonous effect on my localSys xx motivation.
-- new: OC bond mufu
Why the OC mufu is not something to buy-n-hold?
One reason is expRatio. Is there some long-term trend? I don't see it.

Shall we ask some OC senior advisor?

Inflation, recession, covid restrictions, rental income decline, health decline due to aging
.. are some of the common "stressors" that don't become my stressors, because they affect many people around me
 more seriously.

Q: What's special about long commute? Why do I suffer so much while others don't?
A: 49 out of 50 of my peers can tolerate it better than I can, just as in an economy seat on a long flight.

Remind ourselves to adjust our perception to notice the gems in the unit
* new tiles with horizontal edges, will be easier to drill
* plenty of vertical space in laundry room, toilets,, for storage

-- new: minority patients
opening eg: ED medication ads always feature older men. What if you need ED in your 30s? You may get a sinking feeling. It requires serenity, harmony, (passive? yes) acceptance

Desensitizing .. the mass media will always feature older men. You can't blame them, and you can't stop them. What you can do is desensitizing -- to stop your Sys1 reacting to the subtle hint that ED usually affects men in that age group. 

No advertizer mean to hint that you are too young to need treatment. Definitely not, but such negative interpretations are sys1, natural, commonplace and understanable.

My realYoga sessions also need desensitizing, as I over-react to the irrelevant instructions that apply only to other students.

eg: Dementia publications always feature aged (usually female) adults. What if you need help at an earlier age like 40s?
eg: hair dying ads always feature older users, but some of my friends had white hair in their teenage.
eg: Stutter treatment publication always features males. What if a stutter patient is a female?

-- update bpost on bpost proliferation
.. My adaptation(s) to the proliferation problem:
more soft-deletion of outdated bposts
git blogging now uses less New more Update including comments
more one-liner alias bposts, to be removed later.
more time spent on fuxi using PubDate adjustment and less time spent creating new bposts
more comments in bpost titles.. In some cases, a post title or its tag/category are more impotant than the (brief) post content

-- new: China's growing number of patents
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/united-states-china-intellectual-property-patents-ownership-economic-policy-innovation-technology-2783356

In 2021, China was the world’s top patent filer for the third year in a row. Chinese firms have filed approximately 75 per cent of global artificial intelligence patents in the past decade.

China’s production of more IP does not automatically translate into a strategic advantage in economic competition with the United States. Rather, it is high-quality IP that has assumed a critical role amid globalisation and the emergence of global value chains, providing exclusive rights to license processes, brands and technologies essential for manufacturing.

Although China’s leadership is well aware of the importance of IP quality over quantity, China’s IP receipts of US$8.6 billion in 2020 do not come close to the United States’ enormous US$113.8 billion.

This is likely due to China’s IP tending more towards adaptive innovation – over half its domestic filings are utility patents. These have lower eligibility requirements (qualifying criteria), protection periods, indicating lower IP quality.

Moreover, in 2020, only 8 per cent of China’s patents were granted abroad compared to 29 per cent of the United States’. Overseas patents are crucial for protecting a country’s IP across global value chains. 

Only 10 per cent of global gold standard "triadic" patents – a set of patents that are registered with EU, Japanese and US patent offices to protect the same invention – were filed by China in 2019, while the United States accounted for 22 per cent. 

-- update fake role models..
I remember ML's friend, the 领头羊 guy desribing his persistent headache. 
At that time I was envious of his exclub and successC.
Now I think his xpSelf suffered for years. He looked like a failureE. Not enviable at all.

-- new: questionable statistics on product effectiveness
eg: My noise-reduction strip that's fixed below my door is designed for large gaps (like 2cm) below the door. For my door, its effectiveness is unnoticeable.

eg: Many foods are "proven" to help weight loss, but sponsored research deliberately recruite obese participants. For my family members (and many friends) who are marginally overweight, the effectiveness is questionable.

eg: Online learning sites, and some video-based tablet devices are designed for primary/secondary level students to learn on their own. They are "shown" to improve grades, but shown uisng a sample of students who are already keen on self-learning, or samples of students without classroom facilities. For most Singapore students I know, the effectiveness is questionable. These students are already overloaded with classroom-based, exam-driven learning with heavy homework.

-- new: 人在 finDev exclub: can fall out any time
I do feel like belonging to an exclub based on gross salary... above 95% of Singapore residents' salaries (household income is a different historgram). See https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/14177/u-s-income-3segment-sg/

Note I have ignored my NNIA.

Q: where does my $$wealth come from?
A: not inheritance, not rEstate. It's mostly from _finDev_ salary

Q: where does my FullerWealth come from? burn rate control[breakaway]

However, the finDev exclub is elusive, impermanent. We can fall out any time.
