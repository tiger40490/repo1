--new: xp staying-on after PIP, with dignity
soulSearch

GS: informal, unofficial PIP. After it, I stayed for close to a year.
Stirt: I overcame the setback at end of 2014 and scored Meet/Meet albeit without a bonus. 

Now I think it is possible to stay on with dignity and pride.
I hope at my age now, I grow older and wiser, less hyper-sensitive less vulnerable, more mellow more robust, or even more resilient. That would be a key element of emotional growth and maturity.

--new jolt: VP^contractor: lower stress]U.S.
After hibernation, for the first few years in the U.S. quite possibly my stress level (and wife's) would grow.

Q: Would a contract job or a VP job give me stress relief? Clearly, contract job feels lighter, despite the lower salary and lower job security.

Boss personality is the biggest wildcard, but I would say job nature (esp. expectation) is crucial/vital. VPs are benchmarked and ranked. As contractor, I think renewal based on budget is the main appraisal.

--new: gift ideas for kids
For boy, food/drinks are not very good. Peraps fancy (relatively) healthy food can be considered

simple toys are good. Be prepared for fleeting interest.

--update blogpost on sound bytes
I have a naive, idealist expectation of my kids. By that standard, any kid I have would fall short and become a disappointment.

--update blogpost on ... blogging 
For a long time I felt confused, powerless , helpless against the challenges coming from the environment, the exam system, fellow parents, my son's resistance, and my own EQ limitations and brain power limitations.

Unexpectedly, Blogging has given me a much-needed sense of empowerent, control and direction. It shed light into the dark. 

For anger mgmt at face time, therapeutic blogging really helps.

"Am listening without hearing anything" -- In this sentence, hearing is the (successful) result whereas listening is the (possibly passive) effort

"You said you hear us, but are you listening?" In this sentence during the George Froyd event, hearing is passive act of receiving info whereas listening is active effort.

--new: biggest c++dev projects #$5k DBS
In 2015 I toyed with the outlandish idea of applying for a $5k/M DBS job just to get a hardcore big-project c++ dev experience.

The criteria for "big" depends on the specific skills you want to demonstrate or learn.

* If you mean navigation, tracing, build, enhancement, large team BestPractices,,, in a large codebase, then MS is largest, followed by Macq MTS and Macq quant. 

* If you mean substantial source code size that demonstrates data structures, threading,,, then my NYSE integrated feed parser is largest 
followed by my weekend coding interview projects. Mvea is next biggest.

It's worthwhile to review those weekend projects, mostly hosted in cppProj
