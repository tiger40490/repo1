--new new blogpost: over last10Y no$roti2branch out@java because..
So far, we java developers were lucky so we see no financial gain in diversification.

I feel someone like Mithun has low motivation to deep dive outside java so their breadth and depth would be (not slightly) limited
--new blogpost: decline of quant-dev: low value-add
Q: why quant jobs used to be more abundant and pay a premium even though the economic value-add of the quant skill has always been questionable. 
A: because the traders made money and subsequently received a big budget. Now budget is lower.

Same can happen to quant traders.

Some UChicago lecturer once commented that everyone should get some quant training as every high school student does math. I think it is not necessary.

I am more theoretical and was naturally attracted to this domain but the value-add reality soon prevailed.

Tech shops love algo challenges and speed-coding which have dubious value-add similar to the quant skills. However, the hot money in tech sector is bigger and last longer. 

--update blogpost on take-home coding iv:
ensure file timestamps are all within a short window. Prefer to use fewer files

if I claim 2H, then leave some rough edges

If using c++ then show off some TMP hacks

do i need to implement user edits?

do i want to spend many more hours on a thread-pool async solution? yes this would be fun

competitive strength in speed coding contest -- such contest are now more prevalent and the skills are more valued 
competitive strength in dStruct/algo beyond the classics
competitive strength in core cpp QQ
competitive strength in core java QQ -- bigger job market
competitive strength in socket QQ
competitive strength in SQL QQ (and perl GTD) -- better than swing 
competitive strength in math in school -- huge and long-term impact
competence in localSys -- no long-term impacts, so Ashish's t-investment is unwise
improvement in yoga and fitness

In each "competitive" case, you build up competitive strength over J years but may lose it in K years. Each strength has very different long-term impacts, not "zero" (transient) as we sometimes perceived them to be.

Valuable resources are scarce and is a competition. Therefore this competitive profile has long term impact on health, mental aging, stress level, job choices, commute, amount of annual leave.

Any higher ROTI?

You can say every woman's natural beauty has imperfections when you see that woman everyday. This is because our idea of perfect beauty is based on paintings and photos, not live humans. Similarly, every endeavor's ROTI has imperfections compared to our naive, idealized concepts.

If you look for imperfections you will always find some.... but such fixation on imperfections is cynical, demoralizing and unproductive research

Need to zoom into my strategic strengths + long term interests such as low-level, theoretical stuff, pure algo, dstruct, and avoid my weaknesses 

low level QQ -- my strength
low level investigation using tools + codebase -- my weakness
picking up new GTD challenges -- my relative weakness
picking up new IV topic -- my relative strength
