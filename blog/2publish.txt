--new: restaurant: beware raw veg salad
quantity of veg -- is often too small, perhaps a fistful. In contrast, my home-made salad is easily twice that quantity if I choose carrot, cucumber, raddish, tomato... For leafy veg like lettice, the restaurant portion size is bigger than those, but still dwarfed by my home-made version.

cost -- is too high. Perhaps I'm paying for the cutting, washing, selection of components, serving and the tablespace. What I want from the dish is just the raw veg

dressing -- is almost always unwanted

Nevertheless, raw veg salad is usually cheaper than protein dishes, and often healthier.
