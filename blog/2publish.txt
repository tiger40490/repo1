--new: self-discipline against drugs

XR said he would show pictures to his kids and drive home the reality about drugs.

If in U.S., he could attend a religious school or charter school with strict control.

--new: gadget set-up anxiety
I tend to experience a lot of anxiety when I set up my new devices, esp. smart phone and laptops.

We all exeprience a growing, unwanted dependency on gadgets. I want independence.
My dependency is due to efficiency ...
I use gadgets not only for communications but as extension of my brain.

Q: Can you live a day without this gadget?

--new: ##reasonable, non-essential, addictive foods
For these foods, most of us mere mortals find the wrong-quantity temptation challenging, so I would say "Stay as far away from these foods as possible". 

However, it could be harsh and unrewarding to stay away for too long. I endorse periodic abstinence. I practiec it on ice cream. 

rice
nuts
century eggs
bread with nuts or other plant produce, but without cream
? creamy cakes? not reasonable, usually bad for health
? ice cream
? hummus? Not so addictive

--new: whole fruits beat juice 
fruit juice is more convenient than whole fruits but is inferior because
* many bad ingredients are hidden. 
* juice go bad as fast as half-eaten fruits
* less fiber, less filling
* many fruit flavored drinks are nothing but a regular sugary drink with a bit of fruit flavor additive. Nothing to do with juice at all.

--new: bad substance: degree of harm
when it comes to calorie counting, One of the least noticed math features is
various degrees of "bad" when we decide to loosen up and eat bad food

I feel creamy cakes are among the worst, but for most people, it is probably impractical to completely avoid creamy foods as if they were opium. Various degree of bad -- fried peanut and alcohol are both worse than creamy.. tobacco is worse than alcohol and drugs are worse than tobacco. 

In the mass media, we can see the different attitudes towards different categories of "bad" subtances.

More stupid are the calorie-dense foods that aren't satisfying -- fried peanuts; alcohol; mint ice-cream; cheese chunks; 

--new: buying small packets of nuts
Nuts are OK but not essential 

Slowly get into the habit of eating/buying small packet of nuts. This is based on an honest assessment of my limited self-restraint

--update blogpost
In SG, family meals present the wrong-time and wrong-quantity temptations. Living alone in Singapore, I face only the wrong-food temptation and I have better control.

--new: score each delicious
For each highly attractive food (creamy cakes, flavored nuts,,,) I will record up to 3 scores. (No more than 4 different scores as I would tend to forget.)
* published calorie density vs my own estimate thereof, on my own digestive system, in my own body
* the food's value as a taste-enhancer to encourage me to take in more raw veg.

Case study -- nuts are the prime example of this type -- high published density but lower density in my estimate, and high value as a companion for raw veg. For better enhancer score, I should take only garlic flavored nuts without coating.

Case study -- left-over starch in a delicious starchy food. For example, Red-bean bun or pizza ,,,
I often use these foods to help me take in more raw veg. 
After I eat up the most tasty part, there's the left-over, usually starchy. I always feel a semi-conscious urge to finish the left-over but .. but the satisfaction+reward vs calorie "load" profile simply don't make sense!
 
.. les simportant scores:
* harms and benefits. Few foods have known side effects -- tobacco, trans-fat, alcohol, 

Before I blacklist a highly attractive food, I better decide really how bad it is.
