I now feel Wall St QQ demands more experience than coding IV of west-coast. Coding drill can use Leetcode over months.
QQ requires not so much project experience but a lot of interview experience. It takes more than months of exploration and self-learning.

Many inexperienced candidates were highly valued in CIV.

--update blog ... csy:
the IV successes define me.
If I don't have these successes, I might feel almost worthless.

--update blogpost CIV=anti-aging
The west-coast style of CIV is effective for anti-aging, just like yoga.

I think it's more anti-aging than other xx.

I hope I am up to the game and can continue to play the game. I see many people gave up after an initial growth phase
