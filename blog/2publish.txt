I observed that Solaris/Oracle is harder to self-teach than linux/mysql/php/python/perl/javascript because even a high-school student can install and hack with the latter. Entry-barrier is non-existent.

Similarly, I now observe that Wall St QQ-IV demands longer experience than coding IV of west-coast. Coding drill can use Leetcode over months.
QQ requires not so much project experience but a lot of interview experience. It takes more than months of exploration and self-learning.

Many inexperienced candidates were highly appreciated in west coast interviews. No such appreciation on Wall St.

--update blog on 'expert'
If I were a 5Y VP (or ED) I would doubt if I'm just a localSys expert or an accredited expert as proven on benchmarks/interviews.

Look at Shubin/Steve, the Sprite expert in London, Richard of Quoine .. 
Their expertise and value-add are be marginalized in the context of the current mainstream technologies

--update blog ... csy:
the IV successes define me.
Without these successes, I am likely to feel a total failure and worthless, probably more than once a years -- self-knowledge.

--new blogpost: lucky:free from negativity@CIV #CSY
i feel so lucky about freedom from negativity towards coding drill. 

Major advantage! Most of my peers are bogged down by this negativity.

--update blogpost CIV=anti-aging
The west-coast style of CIV is effective for anti-aging, just like yoga.

I think it's more anti-aging than other xx.

I hope I am up to the game and can continue to play the game. I see many people gave up after an initial growth phase

--email to wife
I told a few people

Many smarter women become scheming and cunning (I ran out of English adjectives to describe them) to take advantage of the husbands. 

In contrast, my wife is a simple women, so I feel very safe and secure in my marriage. Simplicity is her virtue.
