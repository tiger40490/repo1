--new: unexpected successes: %%ROTI@boy
Peter Drucker singled out unexpected success as the valuable-yet-neglected story, more neglected than unexpected failures. Here are some of the unexpected successes in terms of my ROTI on boy.
NTUC trips
math sheet on his own
macRitchie
jogging in stadium
Superpark
bike trips

--new: When setting up a new phone (laptop, and outlook are similar), i need to simplify it.
The more I rely on a device (laptop, linux, printer/scanner, camera..) the more I need to (invest time and) analyze my priorities and preferences.

--new (for wife): iphone explosion due to overcharge overnight
Apple Inc hotline told me that there is builtin protection for overheating.

If it's a genuine iphone without damage or tamper, then it won't explode. If it does, it's a defect. What we see on video footage could be fake. 

Before a phone explodes due to overcharge, there would be signs of unusual heating.

--update blogpost on deprivation
Fact: thanks to globalization, food and clothing cost is reducing world wide, so is the minimum cost of living, at least in SG.

Q: but why is our monthly burn rate not reducing?
A: I would say as a bachelor, my burn rate slowly reduced, but as a family, we all want the same level of luxury and creature comfort as our neighbors. 
We would FEEL impoverished and deprived if we can only afford to consume at the same level as 10Y ago (which has now become cheaper)

This question has implications on FIRE and bare-bones ffree.

Wife, as a mainstream consumer, wants to feel "affordable" when considering certain everyday "lifestyle" spend like a toy, personal care, home fixture, fancy food... 
If her friends can afford something, but I tell her "not necessary", she would feel deprived.
To me these "lifestyle" items are all unnecessary, but I'm no purist either .... 

At my abstinence level, projected family burn rate is SGD 2k. 
In contrast, at wife's spending level, she told me 4-5k excluding housing, major medical and travel. 
She wants freedom to spend any way she wants, without asking for approval.

I kind of believe I can be truly *comfortable* at, say, 4k burn rate (excluding housing + major medical + college tuition), but for her, the 'comfortable' level is possibly 8k. The ERE author is much lower.

--update blog on credibility
if the Cambodia developer were a prestigious builder operating in the U.S. or Europe, offering their assets as a REIT, the GRR would be much lower, due to better credibility. 

Credibility translates to higher demand and lower "discount" in the form of GRR.

--new jolt: new c++features=mostly4lib developers
In C++0x, Half of the major new language features are designed for the standard library developers.
The unspoken assumption -- these features are equally useful to other library developers.
The follow-up assumption -- app developers also need to use some (and understand all) of the nitty-gritty details.

In reality, these nitty-gritty details are Not relevant to GTD for app developers.

--new: java give us"no"contorl over object's memory layout
No struct. (c# is better)
A string object (even as a field) is always a seperate heapy thingy, never embedded char-array

--new: data API
A data api for javascript consumers, python consumers, Excel consumers.. can include
smart search
subscription API like server push
streaming API
sorted collection API -- getSortedByCategory(category), getSorted(searchCriteria)

--new: std::bitset: popular ] WallSt c++coding IV
std::bitset is popular in WallSt c++ coding interviews. Easy to use iFF you are an experienced c++ developer.

to_string() and cvctor from string like "011100101011010"
to_ulong() and cvctor from ulong
operator[] returns a reference, so you can assign to myBitset[0]. Designed to superfically mimic a raw array. Actually, return type is not reference to a bool. Rather, I think it's a reference to a specific posiiton in the "backing store". See http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/bitset/bitset/operator[]/

Avoid the notion of "left/right" when using bitset. Prefer "higher/lower" instead. Lowest bit has position 0, becasue bitset is designed to represent a binary integer. Therefore, to scan from highest bit, we must iterate from bitset[size()-1] to bitset[0].

--new: price discovery and closing auction
When an order is sent directly to NYSE, NYSE could follow an algorithm and route it to BATS-Y which fills it. I guess the fill report should probably show 30=BATY

liquidity indicator might show 3 (routed out)

An exchange provides the (nearly) ideal venue for price discovery, but in reality the fragmentation of liquidity (eg: routing-out) makes price discovery non-trivial even on a large exchange like NYSE.

Luckily, the closing auction remains a centralized process. Even though a stock symbol can be traded on multiple exchanges beside the primary listing exchange, auction orders are always sent to the primary listing exchange.
