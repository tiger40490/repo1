oth
If SG citizenship offers so many tantalizing 'carefree' features, then why are they unattractive to so many shrewd Chinese professionals?

A: citizenship is hard to get
A: even if we agree that SG citizenship contributes to a bare-bones ffree far out in the future, the ffree and contribution are small and unattractive to most people
A: At our age, to abandon the current home country (US or ..) and try out a small SEA country is highly questionable, risky and a long shot

--new : nightly battle due to home cooking
* In Bayonne I never had enticing home-cooked food waiting for me when I reach home. 
* In  SG, these foods are much more enticing than the restrictive foods I had in office !

Wrong time temptation? Partially, since I am not so hungry, but this is different from the textbook case where I was not hungry at all.

wrong qty temptation? partially, since I tend to "finish off everything". This is particular seriosu in the nightly battle.

wrong food temptation? partially. These foods are not as light as the other foods

Sugg: use protein smoothie to combat the temptatioins?
Sugg: fancy fruits to combat the temptation
Sugg: eat something nice before coming home?
sugg: if i know I will have trouble with the wrong-time or wrong-qty temptations, then try to fast before going home.

buy property only if you are convinced the local economy would grow over the long term.
In such a context, property is a good inflation protection.

* population growth
* normal inflation

with 6k salary, some exclusive "clubs" would reject my family members -- financially disqualified to enroll,,, These include immigration, investment, branded educational institutes etc

In a slightly similar way, when other kids (wives) can afford something nice but I have to say "We can't afford", it feels just like disqualified...

A slippery slope ! Even though we did quailfy for many "exclusive clubs" like uchicago, SG citizenships, there are always more-exclusive clubs, which would evantualy make everyone in my circle feeling disqualified and bitter
Consider the billionair-below-40 club

-- update blogpost on SG job market
Basically no change in the landscape since 2015. The jobs available to me are mostly ibanks.

cherish the MLP job but beware attachment
If this job goes sour, I would have to consider WallSt, rather than another perm job in SG
