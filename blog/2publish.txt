--new: blogging=recreation^coping #therapeutic
Each activity below can be recreation, (like blogging) soaking up huge amount of spare time, but at times each can play a more constructive role, perhaps a critical support

comparison shopping -- can be relaxing and even therapeutic 
painting -- Churchill
music making (I didn't say 'listening')
workout -- therapeutic
blogging -- both recreation and a coping device.
As recreation it tends to soak up most of my spare time, competing with 
* workout
* localSys study
* coding drill

As coping device it is heavily relied on all the time. Not a substance abuse and Should not be criminalized..

Sometimes these different roles are not easily discernable and consequently the zsms kicks in...

--new: fine for lost items
When an item is misplaced and unfound over 3 days, the first time fine will be 10x the price.
If something is lost 2nd time, double the fine to 20x
For 3rd time, double the fine to 40x
Get him to agree.

Good to post it on fridge for a few day.. but not necessary

--new: signs of early give-up

A: concentration

--new: delay a year in SG school
if we must quit US and return to SG we can consider an international school or delay a year and get boy to join a JC as an older student. Remember HJC classmate Zhong Xiong.

I too was delayed for 1.5 years but excelled in HJC. I accepted very grudgingly. My parents were unashamed unapologetic.

I also had many NUS classmates a few years older

..consider IB school for boy
earmark 30k/Y tuition

Once he leaves the public school system, he can't come back!

bring boy to visit some of them? He may prefer an IB school to a public school !

If I lose my MLP job, I have 3M of package but I would need to immediately start the U.S. relocation. Boy would have little choice but move to U.S.

--new: low latency: avoid dynamic data structures
RTS uses no STL containers.

In my first programing job, I used C without malloc, because I used only array + struct. If my collection were to grow at run time, then I would have needed DAM. 

I feel low latency generally avoid mid-day DAM. If DAM required, then pre-allocation is preferred.
