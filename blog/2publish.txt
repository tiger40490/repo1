--update forgetful trips
avoid unnecessary checking on phone, wallet, laptop etc when outside home/office. Probability of "accident" is slight worse when outside due to distraction, but cost of accident is significantly worse.

For 0.txt printout, accident is less likely as it is in a low-risk pocket.

-- update post on AMB "action"
blogg, reviewing, discussing with friends ... is also action.

-- update CIV skills https://btv-gz.dreamhosters.com/2018/07/02/ect-bp-drill-has-lasting-value-to-family-well-being/ 
All the skills required for CIV [BP, syntax..] are just like QQ -- never required at work.

So 10Y professional project experience won't improve your CIV performance. An undergrad can outperform you given enough practice.
