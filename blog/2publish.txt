-- new : professinoal women choosing to stay-home in their 40's
I like LZ.Yu's wife's first-hand description of home-making for four years. Indeed, some people can be satisifed with such a lifestyle. 

She also said 7/10 of her college girl-classmates are currently staying home. I don't know how many of them are happily "retired" like her.

A big factor is age of children. The younger, the more they need a stay-home mom. I think 4 years ago, her younger kid was 14. 

One factor is job hunting. She had only one job in Singapore and presumably she is not keen to become a job hopper.

If she doesn't find a "good enough" job, then she may just decide to stay home.

-- new: old dvelopers are not always expensive.
paradox: many old-timers struggle to get decent increments, while other old timers move up the ladder.

Move up or move out.

Those move-up guys are seen as leaders with a wealth of valuable experience and leadership trec.  Note localSys knowledge is not really part of perceived "wealth of experience". The valued experience has to be portable.

Those move-out guys are seen as uncompetitive, no longer in-demand, but they are by no means expensive.

-- new: Leverage: slow-n-steady
t_tectonic
vague

My definition of Leverage:  maintain a steadfast focus on continuous improvement at strategic leverage points, based on personal convictions, and you are likely to pull ahead in 10Y

Applicable to any of marathons.

eg: I spend lots of time refreshing the English vocab I learnt in the past. Other students tend to focus on new words.
eg: I spend lots of time reviewing past coding problems, while other job seekers mostly focus on new problems.
eg: Those team members who spend enough time exploring localSys would eventually prove themselves relative to those who focus on deliverables.
eg: I focus on career longevity, while my cohort tends to focus on brank and salary.
eg: I focus on raw veg, starch reduction and other diet habits. My cohort tends to focus on strength or appearance of health.
eg: Warren Buffett docused on cash flow rather than hot tech stocks.
eg: I focus on current income rather than windfall paper profit. Now I have pulled ahead in brbr, FullerWealth, ffree.

-- new: more healthy than average
When I say "I'm far more healthy than average" we are assigning some composite numeric rating to our individual health condition. 
It's a vague composite. Here I want to highlight a few elements relevant to myself

dental .. my siliva has a more cleasing effect
bone density .. my bones are denser and more resistant to wear-n-tear
flexibility .. reduces injuries
skin .. some individuals' skin is less prone to radiation damage. Mine is more vulnerable
sleep .. My mom can easily use sleep to recharge and recover from depletion
diet and exercise habits .. are a crucial lifestyle defense. They make an individual "healthy" in terms of lifestyle.
cold .. Many of my colleagues easily catch the cold.
overall immune system .. some immune systems are more resilient. In the U.S. I had only a few minor breakdowns (ear infection, fever)
heart (+ lung) .. some hearts can last longer
BMI deep-green
coping devices .. contribute to a healthier system. They include meditation, sleep, workout, comfort foods, expressive writing, 
psychological defenses .. 

Note I exclude external factors such as healthcare infrastructure, support network etc

athletic capabilities have limited value. Atheletes have stronger hearts and lungs, bones and muscles.

In my list, common keywords are defense, robust/resilience,,, Each person's system is under endless and countless attacks. The healthier system is basically more fortified.

-- new: risk@100% loss in stock pickig
I guess this is one justification (marketing?) for equity mufu.

For any stock to receive $200 of my money, it has to be rather solid, reputable, with a convincing trec.

If such a stock pick still goes bankrupt, then I will accept the result and accept personal responsibility. The initial amount is risk capital anyway.

I think the probability for hitting a bankruptcy among my non-trivial stocks, within 10Y, is 10% [1]. My loss would be ... 5% of my portfolio. But Expense Ratio of a mufu easily adds up to 20% of my portfolio value.

[1] The probability estimate depends on my count of non-trivial stocks. Am assuming 100+

--update blogpost on becoming lifestyle
Most people accept that they would 1) want to stop working sometime in their 60's 2) not be accepted by employers at that age, unless they are doctors, accountants or professors.

Therefore, they don't work to build career longevity. Most likely they won't achieve career longevity. Their lifestyle is part of the reason. 

I don't accept that lifestyle.

--new: worst unacceptable outcome@boy
.. is not benchmark disappointments including career progression
.. is not wellness condition
David's answer -- refusal to talk to parents
Grandpa's answer -- running away from home

My answer is -- effort. If he puts in effort but ends up with those results, I feel I would love him unconditionally. I recall XR's autistic son.

Teresa Teng was not a strong math student but worked hard at every subject.

Currently, despite his piano practice, his poor effort everyday is eroding the loving relationship. Unconditional love is under threat. Boy is very sensitive and can probably sense it.

Grandma notices the tension between two forces inside me. She drew this analogy -- imagine your sponse is diagnoised with cancer. You experience the huge pressure to take on the huge legwork and decide on treatment options for the spouse. At the same time, you may also feel the tendency to reject the cancer, and blame the cancer, but the cancel won't go away. Grandma said the 2nd, negative emotion is counterproductive. Yet it is real and common. 
I feel this is a good analogy. The cancer may be incurable. You still have a job to fight it and slow down its progression.

Remember Biden's love for his son, despite his drug problem. I would say he is still a successful father. Indeed a father would be successful if he did his best to stop the progression of such an addiction.

In the same blogpost, there's also a gay son's story. Is that an "effort" problem?

I'm no perfect child. If I have a son like me, is there something I can't accept? Theft!

My son has no aggression, no cruelty, no dishonesty,,,, that's why I find his laziness unacceptable.
