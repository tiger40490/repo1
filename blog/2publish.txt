I guess IB is Eurpean-centric. The strongest students in pre-U levels are found in east Asia countries such as China, Korea, Hongkong, Taiwan, Singapore, but somehow most of the top students in these countries do not take IB, partly due to English.

So SG competes with the weaker countries of Asia, Europe etc, so SG is on top. I studied in SG so I know China students are stronger on theoretical subjects such as math and physics, becuase the competition and level of difficulty is higher in China.

Another reason is that SG IB students are pre-qualified, whereas other countries are probably open for all. If that's the case, then their average scores will be much lower.

--new: carefree=plenty of t$buffer
Mostly carefree depends on BRBR, but a second factor is a buffer of spare time

Long commute eats into this buffer.

Noisy home also eats into this buffer because the most precious time is private time.

I don't really know how carefree I would feel without the sanctury of the office, but if I recall the locdown period I think my carefree life was seriously messed up. Will I be able to cope better in a similar lockdown? No idea.

--new jolt low-energy@work projects
t_intro
I now feel low-energy (low-absorbency is a second descriptor) on work projects. However, at the same time I often feel high-absorbency on workout (or diet), QQ (or coding drill), parenting,,,

These other absorbency domains are arguably more strategic, so the current situation as described is actually better than the "average" situation which features an absence of absorbency on any front whatsoever.

Is it possible to have high-absorbency on all fronts? Unlikely. Therefore, recognize your priorities, embrace the imperfect self, and celebrate the improved-imperfection. Everyday is imperfect anyway.

I spent money on robux to reduce his gaming time, but is it working?
Need a critical, open discussion with boy.

If not "reducing" then I feel this is like timezone -- spending money to give him the reward that he really appreciates.

--new: #1 practically knowledge
oth?
bold

excluding professional knowledge, the most useful practical knowledge is wellness knowledge including self-care.
How about parenting? Not so much knowledge
How about presonal finance including tax, mortgage? 2nd tier useful knowledge?
How about home repair? Yes userful, but More like skill then knowledge.
How about digital know-how? 2nd tier

--new: risks remain high but am calmer
After circuit breaker, even though infection risk is not lower than before, SG healthcare system is significantly stronger in terms of testing capacity, treatment capacity.

Similarly,

.. bedbug -- the risk remains very very high esp. in terms of suffering, but now I have a more robust mentality

.. tech churn -- disruption remains high, but now I have the insight of WallSt contract market, and I have found java/c++ rather stable. See https://bintanvictor.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=30897&action=edit

I think even if a hiring team doesn't use smart ptr (for that matter, TMP, threading,,), they would drill into this topic as it is a good probe on big4

--new: throw: always explicit in c++
t_clarify
in java, a Throwable object can come from some invisible code, perhaps in the jvm implementation code.

In c++ a catch clause always catches something explicitly thrown by a c++ code module, almost never something from a C library. 

However, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28925878/do-c-standard-library-functions-which-are-included-in-c-throw-exception shows some corner case of undefined behavior in a strcpy(). In such a case, the c++ compiler can do anything such as throwing exception.

Note C functions like strcpy() doesn't throw because C doesn't support exceptions, but c++ compiler is permitted to and does generate throwing code in some corner cases.

--new: sdxq^homeOwnership...
jolt, t_uniBrand
In overpriced markets like Beijing, rental is relatively underpriced and represents a real bargain, but the Chinese doesn't perceive the bargin in a positive light, due to a deep preference for ownership, as an essential basis of security, achievement, social status

How about sdxq homes? Poor bargain in terms of rental demand and commute

How about Ivy League colleges and UChicago? Poor bargain, according to Kyle.

In these cases, mainstream preference is not an accurate reflection of my preference. It's crucial to honor my own preference (and wife's) rather than other people's preferences.

--update blogpost on success
my dad is the very best in his field, but he knows his influence is not so wide, his value not so great, his legacy will not last very long.

In comparison, I have reached ffree fairly early, in my late 20's when I quite my full time job. Reached again after overseas rental started in my early 40's as described to Kyle. Then the mvea and mlp jobs became carefree, and my SGD non-CPF brbr increased way past 2.0.

Am i more successful than him? No simple conclusion.. depends on what your priorities and goals. See my blogpost on success.
