--new: crises anxiety
I get into crises anxieties far too often ..
Let's be slightly more rational and ask ourselves -- what bad news (events) should be considered a crisis? Let's list up to 9 high-level categories. I think they all have some timeline.

* kids developmental problem
* medical condition that should not be postponed indefinitely. Note aging issues are things to be accepted gracefully.
* mounting financial loss 
* family tension
* things out@service but actually needed. Counter example: the bedroom door repair can be postponed.

Here are some fake crises (storm-in-teacup):
* my engagement honeymoon has ended
* my time allocation differs from my rational model -- so what?
* my spare time is not generating any ROTI -- but when did it?
* my workout time has reduced -- but any real effect on my health?
* visible result of my time spent on boy is far below my expectation -- but real progress nevertheless

Slightly less often we notice a shocking deterioration, but irrevesible hence no big change needed. What we need most is acceptance with serenity.
* skin, hair condition, perhaps due to aging
* c++ programmers' life becoming tougher on wall st
* growing population of younger, brighter developers in Singapore job market

Which individuals have the serenity and the discernment? Grandpa, Josh?

reprocessing is my blogging habit. Regurgitation is another word, with too precise a meaning.
