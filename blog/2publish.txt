--update blogpost: Smashing without yelling... possible? Buy or (pick up) some plastic utensils.

--new jolt: focus on my roti: 
In my parenting effort, if I don't focus on my current roti, I would eventually feel the pain.
Analog: if you don't monitor your calorie/burn rate, you will eventually face the cummulative effect.

If some coaching effort is not effective (losing my cool), then stop it early enough, even if boy is suffering in numerous ways, even if I come across as quitter...
Basically, I can waste more time by trying to "help" him.

jolt: my deep (vague) disappointment with my renzi effort was largely due to the worldly, materialistic "progress". 
No progress, then i feel time wasted. That's materialistic and impatience.
