--update blogpost: good thing about mlp
not sure which blogpost it is!

Flexible morning hours. If I can sleep early, then I can reliably enjoy a big chunk of morning quiet time. 

--new: burn=materialistic_ROTI+self_discipline
Now I think my vague sense of 'burn' was a mix of  materialistic ROTI + harsh self-discipline over the lazy self. 

(When thinking of burn/rot, there is always a harsh, imposing self2judge at the back of my mind. )

I have a destructive self-hate and implicitly consider myself too lazy and weak. By my standard every human shows weakness. 
* I beat myself up over stretching in lower-middle school. The most painful experience in my life.
* I still hate myself frequently because I couldn't "practice yoga at home everyday". Well, those (mostly women) who can are probably too weak for daily exercise, continuous learning, ...
* I beat myself up over coding drill
* I beat up my son over his math practice

I once demonized masturbation, eggs .... all based on unfounded theories. 

I used to set an self-expectation of such high self-discipline that every human would Fall short, including grandpa, Wenqian, .. but I thought my standard was normal and achievable if I simply Try Hard. 

.. Now I'm older and wiser. 
I know these standards are too hard for mere humans. We humans are not machines. 
No one has such strong will as to force the body to do all the painful things.
In real people, the strong motivation comes from within, from a desire, not from self-discipline.

My diet is probably the best eg -- so tough, unenjoyable, but I could put up with it because the level of pain is lower than other people feels.  If you ask me to cut further and further, I will experience too much "pain" in terms of self-deprivation.

How about early rise? In 1993 I once beat myself up for not getting up earlier. For 25 years since, it was impossible to last beyond 3 days. Now I have lasted about a month !
Self-discipline and will power has Never been the key in early rise.

Yoga is another unbelievable example -- my physical shortcoming, painful, hopeless, no visible progress, No hope of sustained improvement, but against all odds, I did 2 sessions a week for 8 months in Bayonne. 

--new: selective listen` j4
Selective listening is not so wrong. We need selective listening. Some information, tips, suggestions, facts-n-figures do more harm than good to us. Our mind is not so strong so rational, therefore it can be polluted, influenced... 

One eg is the Internet millionaire on youtube. I used to say "even though I hate his face he might be a good guy just too polished." I used to dismiss my more cynical Chinese friends as prejudiced, opinionated .... until Hongzhi told me some Eric was a 骗子. Then I met another in my very first public speech given at Woodlands library, to 20 interested investors.

I now tune in to my first impressions, my instincts and my gut feelings, even though they are not fair, balanced at all. If I always suspend these unfounded assessments, I would listen to hoaxes all the time.
