-- update blogpost on stock picking distractions
I once spent tons of hours on FSM cherry-picking but underwhelming ROTI

Stock picking analysis? I did that for a while on Robinhood. Not impressive.

Just reading the newspapers alone would take lots of mental energy

--update blogpost on 12M delay
eg: my sis was delayed by a year+ when transferring from RongCheng to Dongzongbu. Is there any negative/hazardous effect? No but at that time I saw it as a stigma

So in my family, both my sister and I went through a big delay and we both turned out fine.

The stigma on delayed students was a modern China phenomenen. There is some kind of perception (superstition) that if a kid is hitting some academic standard, then the younger she is the stronger is her age-adjusted score and academic potential.

--update : ffree ^ envy+FOMO
Other people's envy is the damper of my bare-bones ffree.
If we don't compare to the (wrong) peer group we can feel pretty comfortable and carefree. So why do we compare?

On one hand, minimum acceptable food cost is dropping and I have more than enough income to survive. On the other hand I feel lousy seeing my "peers" earning 10 times more than that minimum. Every one of them seems to complain about cost level.

Q: what's enough? Philip Che said $5k for a family of 4. Wife said 4-5k for my family of 4.

I'm confronting the paradox. In search of a rational perception, I have a chance to restore some balance.

I feel Theordore Rubin's books shed some light
