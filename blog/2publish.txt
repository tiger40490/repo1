however strong you are in a dev team, there are tasks to "reveal" your relative weaknesses, unless you are stronger than average on all fronts

-- update blogpost on 12M delay
eg: An RTS suport manager, a white American, told me a sizeable percentage Americans choose to earn a degree in their 30's. (My NUS class age profile is not too different, with up to 10% in the late 20's.)
This route is similar to the very common "returning" Master's student who have worked for a few years to gain some firsthand experience of the working world. 
In my MSFM, about 30% of the students were experienced.
I think these "older" students often come in with higher motivation, rather than forced to study as my son is now. 

Not every student is suitable for a nonstop flight secondary->preU->undergrad->Master's 

* If I lose this nice job then emmigration would be the default route. 
* If boy does poorly in secondary school he would not attend poly or JC but serve NS first (I could then work in U.S. alone). 
* If he finds motivation before 16, then we can choose to emmigrate or complete JC.

--new: cashcow^passive^nonwork income
"Cash cow" can be passive or active mgmt, but is reliable, not diminishing
"nonwork income" can be passive or active.

Beside my GRR, truly passive income is rare.
* div stock is more passive than rental property, but less consistent in most cases.

rental income is the best inflation-proof passive income. Dividends are also effective. In contrast, insurance products don't provide good inflation protection.
--new: ffree: j4 peer-comparison analysis
aboutOth

Q: Why writing so many blogposts comparing my ffree with peers?
A: since my teenage years I have observed the vast majority of adults (99% of the people around me), and witnessed their struggle and stress, and later experienced the same myself. 
Since 2017 I started seeing some reasons to feel free -- surreal. It demands a clarification. 

There are a few /identifiable/ differences (btw me and peers) not only in attitude but in the actual cashflow situation 

Another j4 this comparative analysis -- FOMO esp. due to brank (a lost game)

A secondary j4 -- rationalize my U.S. housing decision. The mainstream choice is a $800k school district home.

-- update blogpost on SG inflation
For long-term burn rate management, inflation (along with medical) is one of the biggest concerns.

3% SG official inflation rate?
My own burn rate record-keeping is the most reliable and relevant data source
If we exclude flights, kids, bx, rental cost, then the "couple base burn rate" is showing very low inflation

In fact, I sense a deflation due to price reduction in food and clothing. Also electronics, flights, haircut show deflation.

long-term (30Y) prediction of inflation is unreliable. 3k/M burn rate growing by 100% over 20Y or 30Y is unreliable.


--new: fledgling ffree: keep low profile
my barebones ffree and carefree life now is 1) impermanent 2) precious 3) based on sound principles but a thin foundation

If I were to describe it to Shuo, XR, YH or another "peer", they would soon identify the vulnerabilities in my "system" such as (but not limited to) limited earning capacity to deal with "blows" i.e. contingencies. 

My ffree is indeed vulnerable, so better keep it to myself. Only tell family once a while.

The more you broadcast your ffree, the more visible you become.
