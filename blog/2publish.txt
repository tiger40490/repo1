--new: theoretical min burn rate during retirement
Conceptually, excluding accommodation, bare-bones monthly burn rate would be 50% allocated to food. I would guess roughly SGD 500 out of SGD 1k.

food + public transport + public utilities would be 70% of that burn rate.

The wildcard is healthcare. In Singapore, outpatient cost might be $50-$100/month

Across developed countries, food cost is rather low relative to income, and possibly falling if we aim at the "basic healthy" level. Public transport and utilities are subsidized because 50% of the households can't afford higher rate on these essentials.

CNY eve steamboat in hindsight
:) very very low starch and fried food, against temptation of wrong-food
:) removed all visible fat
:) no drinks
:) lots of veg + tofu for fill-up. Even more fruits
:) threw away jelly leftover by boy

lots of beef, pork and fish. In hindsight, slightly too much beef. Luckily grandma stopped me.

--update blogpost on nuts
many fancy nuts are
* expensive, much more than peanuts
* have reported health benefits like fiber, heart-healthy fats, just like peanuts
* exotic taste compared to peanuts
* have reported low harm in terms of weight gain, unless you binge. 
Few consumers binge on these fancy nuts because ... expensive!

As such, these are luxury equivalents of the ordinary peanuts, but they are marketed as very special and "healthy" superfoods.

I have achieved a lot (cf my peers) in wellness, ffree, branded degree, career longevity,,, but still, to earn the worldly, materialistic OtherPeople'sEnvy (OPE), I need to move up (or start up). 
This has been the stonewall I hit over and over. 
Not my game, and I gave up years ago.

I think it was wise of me to give up.

Over the years I have been working on the give-up, the stonewall, the OPE, and slowly mellowing up.

Note advanced education credential is an achievement in itself, like a competition title, even if it creates no increased earning.
