--new blogpost: Reusable data structure for many pure algo challenges
construct a data store to hold a bunch of "structs" in linked list of growing vector (O(1) insertion) 
Then we can build multiple "indices" pointing to the nodes

Here are a few average-O(1) indices:
(Note O(1) lookup is the best we can dream of)
* hashtable keyed by a struct field like a string
* array indexed by a struct field like small int id
* If there's a non-unique int field, then we can use the same array lookup to reach a "group", and within it use one (or multiple) hashtable(s) keyed by another field
