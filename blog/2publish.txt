-- update blogpost on 12M delay
eg: An RTS suport manager, a white American, told me a sizeable percentage Americans choose to earn a degree in their 30's. (My NUS class age profile is not too different, with up to 10% in the late 20's.)
This route is similar to the very common "returning" Master's student who have worked for a few years to gain some firsthand experience of the working world. 
In my MSFM, about 30% of the students were experienced.
I think these "older" students often come in with higher motivation, rather than forced to study as my son is now. 

Not every student is suitable for a nonstop flight secondary->preU->undergrad->Master's
