I observed that Solaris/Oracle was harder to self-teach at home than linux/mysql/php/python/perl/javascript because even a high-school student can install and hack with the latter. Entry-barrier is non-existent.

Similarly, I now observe that Wall St QQ-IV demands longer experience than coding IV of west-coast. Coding drill can use Leetcode over months.
QQ requires not so much project experience but a lot of interview experience. It takes more than months of exploration and self-learning.

Many inexperienced candidates were highly appreciated in west coast interviews. No such appreciation on Wall St.

--update blog on 'expert'
If I were a 5Y VP (or ED) I would doubt if I'm just a localSys expert or an accredited expert as proven on benchmarks/interviews.

Look at Shubin/Steve, the Sprite expert in London, Richard of Quoine .. 
Their expertise and value-add are be marginalized in the context of the current mainstream technologies


--update blogpost CIV=anti-aging
The west-coast style of CIV is effective for anti-aging, just like yoga.

I think it's more anti-aging than other xx.

I hope I am up to the game and can continue to play the game. I see many people gave up after an initial growth phase

--new blogpost: note-taking on phone
I think those who use phone in favor of paper or laptop are not serious note takers. The phone has severe limitations for note taking. Inefficient due to screen+keyboard sizes.

During my early 30's with my $100 Palm + foldable keyboard, I was able to take notes better.

Overall, phone (and smemo) is good for brief notes below half a page.

Q: Do phones offer any advantages?
A: compared to laptop or paper -- audio-blogging on phone has proven fairly useful
A: compared to laptop -- more nimble and light-weight. one-hand operation
A: compared to laptop -- backup via gmail is more available.
A: compared to laptop -- battery recharge is easier at any USB socket. Laptop recharge has been a minor stressor
A: compared to paper -- I was able to insert or delete content. Copy-paste is ... feasible though inconvenient.
A: compared to paper -- mass upload is feasible
A: compared to paper -- I was able to separate many small topical notes into "pages". More pages makes this advantage more visible. With just 5 "pages", the paper solution became stressful as I worried about losing them wholesale.

Tip: in 2018 I started using designated sequence of dots q[.] in place of comma or dash

git-blogging lets me chip away at multiple (new or existing) posts. More efficient than frequent access to wordpress !

--email to wife
I told a few people

Many smarter women become scheming and cunning (I ran out of English adjectives to describe them) to take advantage of the husbands. 

In contrast, my wife is a simple women, so I feel very safe and secure in my marriage. Simplicity is her virtue.
