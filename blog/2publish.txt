--new: 30-min chunks WFH
I need to break up my time into half-hour chunks. Aim at one productive chunk with 2 other chunks

Q: why I spend so many hours at work but not get enough done?
A: I may realize that I actually do finish quite a lot of work in some of those chunks.

--update blogpost on self-care
what self-care t-spends (don't)work
workout -- is probably the most efficient self-care. Sometimes it lifts my mood, but this time mostly invisible self-care. I need to maintain and hopefully increase the workout.

movies with kids -- generate self-hate, though it sometimes builds some bonding

time with grandpa -- yes self-care

help grandparents with logistics -- not self-care

longer sleep than before -- need to try. Can generate guilt. Can help immunity

tech learning -- might provide some self-care

therapeutic blogging -- is my version of "meditation".

Don't aim to be there for them all the time. I need quiet time4selfcare

--new: y I worry about circuit-breaker extension
fear of productivity drop
fear of losing my cool with kids
fear of self-hate
fear of sustained loss of self-care private hours
fear of overall loss of control

I tend to overlook the improvements in the situation of my family and of Singapore
* improvement in MYS, the supply of Singapore's nutrition
* reduction in new cases in the community
* grandparents secured flight tickets
* I found a sustainable jogging routine

--to give more support to grandparents
both are becoming my dependents. 
arbitrage between him and gm. 

identify the cycle of ineffective handling of challenges. 

make time and create mental energy reserve by reducing the fixation on boy.

.. to give gp more support
physical presence a few times a day.
bring him out for a walk
talk about kids, and other common interests

gp is more isolated, with very limited emotional support network than gm

gm has more recreation including cooking and 

.. to give gm more support
i tend to give her the cold shoulder and make her feel rejected, hard. 

When she hurts I also feel the pain.

Walk away ... works better than a harsh cold shoulder.

create some warm, soft conversations to offset the cold dialogs

show appreciation for her cooking

--new: mainstream solution is often grossly inferior
earliest example: English vocabulary building as baptism by fire? My Singapore teachers/classmates suggested reading newspapers but actually dictionary-browsing proved far more efficient and effective

early eg: personal note keeping? When I bought my first computer in 1998, mostly to keep personal notes, I found the mainstream solution of MSWord was far inferior to ascii files

personal eg: to protect my c:\0 from my son's windows account, the mainstream solution of windows folder security was overcomplicated. See ...
eg: U.S. medical insurance is overcomplicated compared to national healthcare systems in other countries. 
eg: U.S. medical billing/coding is overcomplicated. In contrast the Singapore system is much simpler.
eg: GUI programming? html + browser (before javascript) proved so much simpler than client-server

eg: my very first paid programming job was rather mainstream -- Excel + ftp, but the nascent CGI proved far better documented, more reliable...

eg: file system security?  Microsoft solution is overcomplicated compared to unix. I thought the Microsoft solution was mainstream
eg: config files? Unix tradition uses individual text files per application, much simpler than windows registry. I thought the registry design was mainstream (see my blogpost on registry)

--new: unexpected success with home wifi set-up
* tip: cable point need at least 2 power sockets to support 4 to 6 devices -- modem, router, powerline networking, phone
* tip: place the devices high up, to free up table space. Most devices (except phone) should be shileded from access
** to achieve this, I chose wall-mounting rack
* minor tip: place wifi router in the open living room. Best practice is ceiling-mount. If not possible, consider powerline networking.
* tip: install power sockets higher up throughout the house
