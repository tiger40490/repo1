--new: live free of restrictions
I can live with the restrictions of diet, burn rate... but not LiuShuo style self-restraint in office context.

I feel the suffering is not worthwhile.

--new: y I worry about circuit-breaker extension
fear of productivity drop
fear of losing my cool with kids
fear of self-hate
fear of sustained loss of self-care private hours
fear of overall loss of control

I tend to overlook the improvements in the situation of my family and of Singapore
* improvement in MYS, the supply of Singapore's nutrition
* reduction in new cases in the community
* grandparents secured flight tickets
* I found a sustainable jogging routine
