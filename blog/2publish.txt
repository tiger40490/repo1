All of these vendors claim that their products are revolutionary and leave the traditional solutions in the dust.

However, the use cases are extremely niche. The skill is not highly sought after.

-- new: all-at-once: appraisal
as employee, when I have family issues, kids issues, investment foes, I would fear an appraisal. Even a bonus disappointment would add a heavy blow.

As contractor, no such fear. When I'm let go, I would easily attribute it to budget and go job hunting again.

-- update mag:
sometimes I get into a low mood and carry a negative perception about many of my books, so even a big home library may be insufficient. The gen magazine is an alternative.

-- update or new: personal system4stock-picking 
if you want to gradually develop a personal stock-picking "system", then you need to make a large number of small but real decision, over different times. A few big trades won't grow your confidence fast enough.

To become an experienced stock investor, you also need to make many informed decisions and learn from that experience.

Q: how much retrospective analysis needed?
A: not about how many hours but how much real traction you gain (not wheel-spinning). You should cut down the review when you notice dimishing return.

Quick learning is an advantage of stock vis-a-vis other investments.

-- new: supper floodgate
Tip: end the planned supper with lots of comfort foods, rather than raw veg. I used to have lots of raw veg towards the end, hoping to fill up my stomach, but actually the stomach is impossible to fill up, and the unsatisfying raw food demanded /compensation/ in the form of comfort foods.

Q: Why do I end my supper with lots of energy dense comfort foods including starch, but I didn't feel the same craving in the beginning?
A: I guess the floodgate was opened and hard to close.

-- new: Chinese/Korean couple: bad assumptions
ML.Jiang once told me about some classmates. A Chinese national and a Korean national living in Singapore as a couple, who spoke Japanese at home.

I was impressed.

Immediately I assumed that they speak mostly Japanese between them and their Japanese fluency is equal to their mother tongue.

Well, DaShan the Canadian in China is one in probably 1000 foreigners who speak such fluent Chinese. So to a Japanese national, both of them probably sound non-Japanese.

The less you know someone, the more you assume... Remember HY.Cai

--new: reduce(grave)compliance risk
pre-clear large qty like $1k/name
If I have many names to trade at the same time, then risk of oversight is higher. Avoid working while trading.
small (even fractional) orders are still safer than big orders.
