高压 discipline ..

Observe what the kid wants and fulfill his needs.

keep the communication open as they go through adolescence. 

Accept some variations in individual personalities.

Curiosity is a good thing in a kid.

..JackZ on my family migration
U.S. migration might be more risky for your kids then for you

Make sure you still have enough time for your kids when you are working here.

Parent's time is a key factor in Raymond's success story.

JackZ: If you feel your son is likely to become a manager type, then perhaps the wordy problem skills (abstract logical skills) are not really relevant in the long run. Self-confidence is arguably more important.

Both Jack and grandpa foresee that my derogatory remarks could easily damage boy's confidence.  I use such harsh words to get his attention, but apparently the net effect is counterproductive. Jack suggested -- paste reminder on your computer, in your cockpit, on the mirror ... to remind yourself.

Given the lack of interest in wordy problems, U.S. culture would probably emphasize encouragement not forced practice.

therapeutic blogging takes lots of time, but is more effective than counselling on parenting, wordy problem face time,,,
