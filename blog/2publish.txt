==max path sum problem, where graph node has many directed edges in and out
--variation: single origin, single destination
--variation: single origin, pick best destination among 55 leaf nodes
--variation: each node has a +/- value 
--variation: each edge has a +/- value

I think for these problems, I would try DP. For each node, find and store the max cum sum up to that node.  Need to start from the level 1 nodes (1 hop from origin), then level 2 nodes

for a binary tree (no recombinant), i would use DFT + Kadane

insufficient reward, celebration of the huge effort in coding drill, yoga, diet...

At d-resort:
:) as planned, did some stretching and coding drill, but I basically dismissed and forgot them!
:) as planned, boy did lots of math 

--new blogpost: coding drill@flight
no need to feel guilty about coding drill. The less guilt the better for my system. The guilt is completely counterproductive and unfair
--new blogpost: salary has least impact@family well-being
sometimes I feel 20k lower salary doesn't affect my self-esteem or family well-being. 

In contrast, stigma/respect/coworkerBenchmark, commute, workload have bigger impact on family well-being

stigma has heaviest impact on self-esteem
--new blogpost: self-esteem: stigma^salary gap
In terms of my past experiences of self-esteem under attack, which attacks were more serious and higher priority for future planning?
? stigma/appraisal/coworkerBenchmark
? salary gap cf peers -- relatively easy to accept. 
? brank -- I have kind of given up on this front after I chose the contractor career
Brank without salary gap is no issue actually

? property and other assets
Note workload and commute has no impact on self-esteem

Zofia,

Over 5 years, I see you have proven yourself good at teaching little kids. You are better than most pre-school teachers.

Do you have other strengths such as nail polishing or managing tenants? I think you may be competent at those jobs too.

I now favor locations with more Chinese, so the demand for Chinese pre-school would be higher

--update blogpost on take-home coding iv:
ensure file timestamps are all within a short window. Prefer to use fewer files. Java solutions require more files :(

if I claim 2H, then leave some rough edges like validations
