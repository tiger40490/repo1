==Q: detect cycle in bintree
practical !

dft recursive. use a hashset to keep the current path. When exiting a stack frame, remove from the hashset
I may have this code in github

bft. Upon append, each node keeps a parent-node-set, represented by hash table. Too much memory needed

==Q: if I backscan a post-order output (unsorted sequence), is there a single BST we can build?

I think this is like fwd scanning a pre-order output so yes

--insights 

If I keep a webcam at each tree node
* During a fwd scan of  pre-order output, every node's left child is born before right child.
* During a backscan of post-order output, every node's right child is born before left child. During the actual post-order walk, my left child is always printed before my right child.

For a given BST, the pre-order output is unique; the post-order output is also unique.

Can two BSTs produce the same  pre-order output? I think impossible
Can two BSTs produce the same post-order output? I think impossible

Like the pre-order, the post-order sequence is also a serialization but only for a BST

==update blogpost on FB question:
merging N pre-sorted arrays is O(N logN), same as merge sort?
bigO insight!

--new: good at pushing myself
am good at pushing myself to the limit, sometimes beyond my limit, even if i may not be "good at" them in a competitive sense.
* yoga
* jogging
* coding drill
* camp out

coding drill is arguably the most interesting case study. Other people may complete more problems, but i probably spend more time
* Ranked by number of problems, i'm just average
* ranked by hours spent, I'm much higher
* ranked by effort, I'm even higher, as I push myself harder than others

--new: cod`drill: student^mathematician
A student's approach to statistics is different from a mathematician's. Likewise, I feel the intern way of coding drill is not good for me
* not long-term commitment. I believe most of them would stop after getting a job.
* not in-depth
* not aimed at deep learning and retention
* more like cram

However an unbiased interviewer/observer could find the student stronger than a mathematician!

--new blogpost cod`drill outlasting C++self-study
Am confident that my coding drill will become a "long-term" hobby like java/c++ QQ, better than c#/quant/swing QQ. 

Anti-aging.

Enjoyable? Yes possible and real if no pressure. 

Not theoretical; more immediate result

I think coding drill may even outlast c++ QQ self-study but crucially my c++ QQ has reached critical mass.
