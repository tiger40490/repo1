, this blogpost discusses a burn rate possibly even lower — 70% of the medium family income.

Background: A major pillar of my carefree bliss is the fierce boycott to FOMO/kiasu, exclub, 上一个台阶, benchmark with the MDs, chasing the latency endless goal,, I tell myself and my kids that we don't need even more money once we have enough nonwork income to support a certain burn rate. 

However, if you have not experienced deprivation, consider the Khmer villagers we saw on our last day at Siem Reap. Clearly, each person has a tolerance threshold. What's yours? and what's "enough latency" for you? I guess these are similar to the Level5 or Level6 of ffree. The answer to this question is fairly personal. This requires us to keep an eye on the minimum i.e. the essential things in our lifestyle, and resist lifestyle creep. 

--update on c++ guys unlucky.
Out of 100 java guys trying WallSt jobs, 90 are disqualified in tech screening, often in early rounds. Too many weak candidates without depth.

Out of 100 c++ guys trying WallSt jobs, perhaps 70 are disqualified for the same reason. This does NOT mean your chance of success is higher. The opposite is more likely. The remaining 30 get filtered out in later rounds, for reasons like "well-qualified but not a good match, not exactly what we want"

The expertise entry-barrier is higher in C++, due to wider range of essential knowledge. Java is considered more of a commodity skill.

Therefore, it's easier for me to ace the java QQ interview than c++ QQ interview.

--new: expensive cars breed unhealthy over-usage
quality of life is correlated with more walking/cycling, less driving.

However, the more expensive your car is, the worse you would feel leaving it underutilized in the garage 95% of the time.

Rental car is expensive but worth considering. We may need to buy a car just to practice driving.

--new: price^value when choosing smartphones
price of smartphone depends on
* branding
* component cost such as processor speed, RAM size, screen size, battery capacity
* Is reliability a factor? Not directly. Perhaps the brand and components have an indirect effect

According to my requirements, the "value" of a model depends on
1. reliability
2. screen size
3. battery
