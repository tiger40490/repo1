Hi Beier,

What's the response you got? Did they say you cleared the bar? 

I wonder what's the minimum requirement to clear the bar. Is it one pass or two passes on white-board session? I know a pass on the architecture session is Not in the minimum requirement.

TaskDependency -- I enjoyed the task dependency problem. https://bintanvictor.wordpress.com/2018/05/29/priorityq/ is my recall of the problem. 

I gave my best shot. I thought it was decent but interviewer actually rated it "below-the-bar". Did you come up with a solution with two priority queues? 

CodeReview -- I thought basic functional bugs would not be in any code under review. I focused on code quality, code smells and subtle bugs. So I didn't spend enough time on the core algorithm, and I missed some serious bugs in the code. This was a big surprise. Now I know "code review" actually means "bug spotting by eyeball", so next time I would focus on bugs in the core logic. How did you fare?

Architecture -- is the only question to test professional experience. 

I believe the white-board and code-review sessions are designed such that candidates with 0 to 3 years working experience can clear the bar. Even a high-school students can practice for a few years to pass these interviews.

In contrast, the architecture question required more experience than I had. I thought my ideas, analyses ... were non-trivial but interviewers actually rated it below-the-bar. So I assume they were looking for more technical insights, which more experienced candidates will have.
