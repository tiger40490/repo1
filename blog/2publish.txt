If I receive $100k windfall right now (Not 5 years in the future), I might save it to improve my commute in the U.S. For commute I feel current income is more effective than a windfall far out.

If I receive $1m windfall, I would use it to strengthen my shields and relieve my anxieties.

For Mr Money Mustache, appparently the windfall doesn't mean anythig to him, but I doubt it.

if you attribute success to effort, you sound cocky, conceited, vain

--update on c++ guys unlucky.
Out of 100 java guys trying WallSt jobs, 90 are disqualified in tech screening, often in early rounds. Too many weak candidates without depth.

Out of 100 c++ guys trying WallSt jobs, perhaps 70 are disqualified for the same reason. This does NOT mean your chance of success is higher. The opposite is more likely. The remaining 30 get filtered out in later rounds, for reasons like "well-qualified but not a good match, not exactly what we want"

The expertise entry-barrier is higher in C++, due to wider range of essential knowledge. Java is considered more of a commodity skill.

Therefore, it's easier for me to ace the java QQ interview than c++ QQ interview.

--new: expensive cars breed unhealthy over-usage
quality of life is correlated with more walking/cycling, less driving.

However, the more expensive your car is, the worse you would feel leaving it underutilized in the garage 95% of the time.

Rental car is expensive but worth considering. We may need to buy a car just to practice driving.

--new: price^value when choosing smartphones
price of smartphone depends on
* branding
* component cost such as processor speed, RAM size, screen size, battery capacity
* Is reliability a factor? Not directly. Perhaps the brand and components have an indirect effect

According to my requirements, the "value" of a model depends on
1. reliability
2. screen size
3. battery
