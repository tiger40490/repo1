--new: mkt data sys avoids shared_ptr/STL
t_xRef
shared_ptr and STL containers, java autoboxing ... are avoided in busy mkt data systems due to on-the-fly DAM allocations.
shared_ptr has extra DAM in terms of the ref counter

consider pre-allocation

--new.. STL is fast but heap-hot
STL is faster compared to
* alternative designs using virtual functions
* alternative designs using runtime logic instead of compile-time TMP

However, STL containers are slower than containers without on-the-fly allocation. To match those containers, you can pre-allocate enough capacity at start-up.

--new blogpost:
A fundamental TMP technique is class template specialization. Class templates' flexibility can only be achieved via specialization but function templates' flexibility can be achieved via overload ! Overload is much simpler than specialization.

In [[c++coding standard]], Alexandrescu/Sutter said "Don't specialize func templates", for multiple reasons.

After remembering this sound byte, it's probably important to remember one of the reasons, for IV (halo) and zbs.

--new: ## comfortable position among peers
tag: tectonic, peerComp, othRisk

We instinctively know, to varying degrees, where we stand among our chosen peer group. 
on some games I feel I am unlikely to improve my relative "ranking" so I need to reconcile:
* kids academics
* brank

On other "fronts", I feel confident to maintain my comfortable position relative to peers:
* sg citizenship -- low-cost health care, car-free, property tax
* work-till-70, life-long learning, access to age-friendly job markets
* mobility across multiple job markets
* coding IV skill benchmarked against my age group on Wall St 
* QQ IV beyond coreJava -- c++, c# ..
* wellness
* cashflow -- burn rate, retirement planning, ffree
* home ownership, low maintenance
* stable marriage, valuable support from grandparents
* lower fear of job loss, lower work stress .. thanks to contract
