If 15GB insufficient for wife, we can buy additional "data pack" for one month.

Once you buy, it auto-renews monthly. That's the official (bad) answer. Such a "deal" is inferior to a bigger monthly plan. However, in reality, monthly data packs are better due to flexibility. You can cancel auto-renewal after one month.
