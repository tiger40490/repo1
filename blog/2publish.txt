-- new: memory leak + other paper tigers
t_opaque
mem leak was presented as more elusive than NPE
mem leak was supposed to require source code scrunity.
mem leak in java and c# were challenging in my limited experience, but c/c++ was supposed to be much harder.
There were numerous instrumentation tools to help identify memory leaks. They help reinforce the notions of "complex, opaque, OMH"

I "subscribed" to this huge fear, being "peddled" by numerous well-meaning authors. I felt inferior and helpless like a new-born baby in need of adult protection and hand-holding.
I think the memory leak these authors deal with are much tougher than my memory leaks. 

( Similarly, Henry Luo said DB turning is mostly about indices (yes in practice) but the DB experts would call it simplistic and naive. )

Then in RTS, I and my team used valgrind on a routine basis to identify memory leaks, in our industrial-strength, high-volume, realtime high-impact systems. No other tools were needed in my projects.

.. How about gpgpu, FGPA, kernel bypass, shared mem
I think all of the above are probably very simple in a real project.

.. How about lockfree?
Any design thats not very simple and clean is likely incorrect or high-maintenance.

.. How about TMP?
The complexity is not worthwhile in most projects

.. How about custom memory allocator

-- new: self-assessment: central, high-impact, high-value roles.
In 95G and Barcap, my role in the team was fairly central, high-impact, high-value.

Subsequent roles were somewhat peripheral. I need to get used to it.

To be fair, my OC role with Quest was fairly central. My NYSE Integrated feed handler was visible, high-value. My DevOps role in Macq was central and visible to the tech teams.

--new: architect career needs: breadth imt depth
t_expertise, t_churn
[[Fundamentals of software architecture]]

Developers need technical depth (and need to maintain that depth)... expertise. The book didn't mention the importance of interviews. Interview is the real arena for expertise, because after the interview, on the job, the candidate won't need a lot of expertise.

Archtects need breadth more than technical depth. So the authors advocates/suggests selectively giving up accumulated tech depth in some domains.

But in my experience interviewers seldom value breadth nearly as much as depth. 
by definition, breadth is not-deep ... too shallow to impress in most interviews.

Shallow knowledge is also more subject to churn.

mkt depth .. If 50 out of 100 software engineering jobs out there require some level of depth, then perhaps 5 require some breadth. Therefore, in terms of market depth, breadth is inferior to depth.

-- update the blogpost on 5 tsn domains
Now I recall that for years I was attracted to algo trading, automated trading, any trading decision using some math as it sounds cool.

Now I think this domain is still relatively well-paid, but doesn't generate high profit as before.

The complexity has not reduced. The field still needs people, but I feel it is losing the talent game against the newer domains like web2.0, DS/ML, crypto

-- new or update "native language"
[[understanding and using C pointers]], a library book I have borrowed twice, contains practical GTD expertise nuggets, somewhat similar to [[safeC++]] and the debugging book. NOT written exclusively for library developers.

The GTD expertise are important to a self-respecting committed programmer in C.

functions passing string in/out 
void ptr usage
uninitialized ptr
array/ptr integration

during my college year and CharteredSemi years, I invested myself wholeheartedly in C programming. One of the most enjoyable topics was cStr/array processing, 

critical mass .. was easily achieved 
* small library of routines .. easily memorable
* reliable, well-understood .. no mystery. (Comparable to wait/notify.)
* not abstract and theoretical .. am able to experiment to confirm my understanding. (Comparable to STL)
* a tiny but complete toolkit capable of solving non-trivial quizes or real world problems

Also

* low level... Not many laywers like in Spring or STL. I could get to the bottom. Satisfaction

So I had huge hope that this skill, this valuable critical mass would prove valuable for decades. 

Q: what value exactly?

In terms of deployment of binary, yes compiled C programs (in terms of deployment) permeat the world, probably more than any other language.  

In terms of C libary being used in new development, I think many c++, java, python ... project indirectly use C libraries. Some of their extensions or low-level interfaces are possibly being written in C (like Quartz?). 

In terms of current system programming project, I think C still lead the pack, followed by c++. Almost by definition, system programming uses C or assembly. Even JVM and dotnet CLR are written in C/c++.

In terms of current application projects, C is too low-level .. unpopular. 

Therefore, in terms of overall market value, my cStr knowhow (as part of  my C skillset) has suffered real churn. This churn is faster and more disruptive than I thought in the 1990s. I wish my cStr knowhow is still widely in demand.

-- update .. 
(updating an existing blogpost will take longer)
Through my late 40's to 50, in which technial domain will I maintain my competitive high ground?

core Java language? Remarkably stable
xLang concurrency
xLang dStruct
perl? Unfortunately perl6 has moved
drv pricing + bond math [Type1 dnlg] ? Yes because programmers don't study the math
byte-level parsing
WallSt architecture [Type3 dnlg]

-- new or update: my algo trading experiences
Citi Muni Auto-reoffer, inventory update.
Baml muti matching engine, offer adjustment/resend, position update (against venues) and inventory update (for reoffers)..
OC Quest robot responding to client RFQ
Quest also has a FXO quote update feature, sending to multiple conduits
Mvea sending exchange orders based on client orders. Order state management

Closely related to algo trading is the risk engines in my experience
* Stirt risk engine responding to new trades, position changes, and mkt data 
* Barcap real time risk engine

-- update post on XH.Fu.
Free agents like XH probably value the freedom very high. I once valued my freedom too, and didn't mind earning $2k/M, but when I started dating and planning for family, I realized I was left way behind by my cohort.

The freedom became .. not that valuable.

Nowadays, some of my recent jobs offer very high freedom, comparable to my free-agent lifestyle.

-- new: telecom sector for aging c++developers
In 1996 when we had to choose our specializations, communications specialization was by far the most popular (followed by computer engineering, microelectronics, control engineering and power).
 
In 2002, when I joined Zed, telecom was all the rage. Known to enjoy good margins, excellent moat, and able to pay above the market for technical talent.

HL.Yang is a veteran of the industry and had a lot of positive obsevations to share.

Benny.Zhao was also in a telecom-specific software start-up. 

When I went to U.S. in 2007, I still had a rose-tinted view, and chose Verizon. Then I realized WallSt had been paying higher than telecom.

By 2018, I had lost my rose-tinted view, after consulting Deepak.CM and CSDoctor.

Clearly, the telecom industry is still growing and innovating, at the most critical layer in the tech stack. However, the salary premium has shifted elsewhere. 

I think c/c++ developers still have a lot of opportunities in telecom. There's something in common between c/c++ and telecom -- both are past the peak, still growing outside the limelight, essential to national economies, but unglamorous among the bright young talents. As such, both represent good opportunities for aging developers.

-- new: table lamps: batt/LED : vs bulb
adv: low heat.. important for SG
adv: low energy footprint
adv: power cable required only during charging. See charging tips below.
adv: for clamp lamp, batt model is displacing bulb models. So I better adapt
disadvantage: can't replace bulb. I think battery model is less durable than bulb model

charging restrictions:
* 24H max charge
* every 3M of disuse, charge 8 hours, perhaps in OFF mode. Protects battery life. I think 100% depletion hurts battery.

charging recommendations:
* better recharge well before battery 100% depleted

-- update or new: commercial^home cooking #quantity^quality
t_misperception

Critical thinking .. home cooking is better nutrition, but why my experience proved that my BMI was always better when living alone without home cooking? I would say quantity outweighs quality. 

quality of comercial food .. nowadays I buy more raw foods, less affected by inferior nutritional quality of commercial cooking. 
fast food .. is known for poor nutritional quality, but I seldom eat fast food when living alone.
home food still involves commercial cooked foods such as bakeries, ice creams
nuts .. as a group is never home-cooked. If I eat at home, the nuts in the home stash become unexpected and hazardous.
fish and meat .. perhaps home cooking is better quality, but by how many percent?
vegetables.. perhaps home cooking is better quality. Nowadays I tend to eat raw.
starch at home .. tend to be too enticing. The home stash has lots of outside starch food
starch bought outside .. tend to have more fiber, and stored in a stash under control
soymilk .. home-made is better, and I don't overeat.
milkshake .. home-made is better. 

-- new: buying wellness: how effective@@
There are many "research" or marketing that link fancy new products to wellness. You would think the rich would live healthier lives? Alas, the correlation is very low.

I will use star-rating and dollar-rating ..
$$$*** more free time .. commute; lower-pay jobs
* less driving, more walking, cycling
* simple, low-cost workout equipmenets similar to what I now keep
$$* nearby gym/pool/basketballCourt/// as provided by an office or condo
$** yoga (and other) classes
$ fancy fruits

Note most of the cost-effective items are low-cost.

Note I consciously reject most of the supplements, fancy expensive food. 

$130/M gym fee is tolerable to me, but most of us use the gym only once a week. Let's assume 8 times/M

How about $16/visit flat rate? I would feel I could save the money by working out at home. 
Jolt: but can you do that consistently?

Paying the monthly fee motivates me to go there regularly.

== update lifestyle creep
When a family's disposable income grows, family members break traditional guidelines of simple life

eg: "family car" -> 2 cars per family still not enough
eg: "sharing a bedroom between 2 kids" -> one bed room per kid
eg: "Aircon in bedrooms only" -> a/c in living room and kitchen

-- CpfLife ERS amount won't be enough.

However, the use cases are extremely niche. The skill is not highly sought after.

-- new: all-at-once: appraisal

-- update or new: personal system4stock-picking 
if you want to gradually develop a personal stock-picking "system", then you need to make a large number of small but real decision, over different times. A few big trades won't grow your confidence fast enough.

To become an experienced stock investor, you also need to make many informed decisions and learn from that experience.

Q: how much retrospective analysis needed?
A: not about how many hours but how much real traction you gain (not wheel-spinning). You should cut down the review when you notice dimishing return.

Quick learning is an advantage of stock vis-a-vis other investments.

-- new: supper floodgate
Tip: end the planned supper with lots of comfort foods, rather than raw veg. I used to have lots of raw veg towards the end, hoping to fill up my stomach, but actually the stomach is impossible to fill up, and the unsatisfying raw food demanded /compensation/ in the form of comfort foods.

Q: Why do I end my supper with lots of energy dense comfort foods including starch, but I didn't feel the same craving in the beginning?
A: I guess the floodgate was opened and hard to close.

-- new: Chinese/Korean couple: %%assumptions=unfounded
ML.Jiang once told me about some classmates. A Chinese national and a Korean national living in Singapore as a couple, who supposedly spoke Japanese at home! 
I was impressed.
Immediately I imagined that they speak mostly Japanese between them everyday, and their Japanese fluency is equal to their mother tongue.

Well, DaShan the Canadian in China is one in probably 10,000 foreigners who speak such fluent Chinese. So to a Japanese national, both of them probably sound non-Japanese.

The less you know someone, the more you assume... Remember HY.Cai

buy-n-forget SP500_ETF relies on the index admin as stock pickers to adjust the portfolio. Other ETFs, like sector ETF or other countries' ETF are usually less successful than SP500_ETF

(buy-n-forget a single stock doesn't involve exit-timing. Can rarely beat SP500_ETF.)
