--new? time^absorbency..2 scarce resources
see also blogpost on absorbency domains

time is a /limiting factor/ (with a twin sister) because when I try to break through and reach the next level on some endeavor, I often hit a /ceiling/ not in terms of my capacity but in terms of time. 

Common experience shared by many, therefore easy to understand. In contrast, a more subtle experience is the limiting factor of productive mood. 
This phrase is vague and intangible, so sometimes I speak of "motivation" -- not exactly same and still vague. 
Sometimes I speak of "absorbency" as a more specific proxy. 

Specific xp: I often take leave specifically to provide time for myself but usually can't achieve the expected ROTI.

Specific xp: Many times I took leaves to attend an IV. The time + absorbency is a precious combination that leads to breakthrough. If I only provide time to myself, most of the time I don't achieve much in terms tech learning.

Specific xp: yoga -- the absorbency is very rare, far worse than jogging. 

* the zone -- (as described in my email) i often need a block of uninterrupted hours. Time is clearly a necessary but insufficient condition.
* time for workout -- I often tell my friends that lack of time sounds like an excuse given the mini-workout option. Well, free time still helps a lot, but motivation is more important in this case.
* localSys -- absorbency is more rare here than coding drill, which is more rare than c++QQ which is more rare than java QQ
* face time with boy -- math practice etc.. the calm, engaged mood on both sides is very rare and precious. I tend to lose my cool even when I make time for my son.
* laptop working at train stations -- like MRT stations or 33rd St ... to capture the mood. Available time by itself is useless

--new: complacent guys]RTS #Deepak
Deepak told me that Rahul, Padma etc stayed in RTS for many years and became "complacent" and uninterested in tech topics outside their work.

I think Deepak has sharp observation.

I notice many Indian colleagues uninterested in zbs or QQ topics. That's a fundamental reason for my QQ strength on the WallSt body-building arena.
I think many of them learn the minimum to pass tech interviews.
CSY has this attitude on coding IV but the zbs attitude on socket knowledge 

If you regularly benchmark yourself externally, often against younger guys, you are probably more aware of your standing, your aging, the pace of tech churn, ... You live your days under more stress, both negative and positive stress. 

I think these RTS guys may benchmark internally once a while, if ever. If the internal peers are not very strong, then you would get a false sense of strength.

The RTS team may not have any zbs benchmark, since GTD is (99.9%) the focus for the year-end appraisal.

These are some of the reasons Deepak felt 4Y is the max .. Deepak felt H1 guys are always on our toes and therefore more fit for survival.

--new: Ashish/MLP IV: QQ^GTD
I feel Ashish's MLP IV experience again proves the relative importance of GTD vs QQ

His GTD capacity is evident, but high-end interviews always discount/dismiss GTD and focus on QQ instead, including "problem-solving" as the young bbg interviewer put it.

Tanvil's self-description is revealing, but Ashish is a better example as I know him better than I know other peers.

Viswa is another example. 

GTD superstars are typically not recognized experts. They fail the expertise-benchmark.
