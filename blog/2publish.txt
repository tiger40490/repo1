--new blogpost: need to avoid...
Need to avoid comparing with other kids 
Need to avoid comparing with me on STEM subjects

i need to listen and focus less on stories of my friends practicing math at young age. 

These guys could do it because like my daughter they have more absorbency. 

Listening to these stories increases my frustration that my son lacks the "normal" absorbency and is somehow inferior.

In reality, many people lack the absorbency but have other strengths, so not inferior.

--new blogpost: xxxq = interest for learning specific topics
Here I'm excluding physical skills, but "learning" doesn't equal classroom learning.

I would say whenever my son reads a book he is learning something, not always academic.

--new blogpost: top secondary schools may not be suitable or accessible to boy. 
1) boy doesn't look like the academic type 
2) boy lack the absorbency capacity

In the abilities/effort framework, I see gaps on both fronts... More on the effort side. Effort does affect abilities.
In middle schools I became 'engaged' at a much earlier age than my peers and developed my competitive Abilities.

--new blogpost: predicted saving/burn-rate
Q: prediction: my visible burn rate including mindchamps without tax without air-tickets? 5k, excluding anything from wife's account
saving rate target after allowance payout: 5k. Be kind to yourself. 

Both targets are useful and valuable. but we need different attitudes towards each.

I'm generally competent at saving but stress can still happen

--new blogpost: parents' discretionary spend 
Many fellow parents (plan to) spend disproportionately on their kids because .. they want-to not pressured-to. Chinese parents feel good about martyrdom -- saving up and investing on kids education. 

Labor of love... However, Some (33 to 50%) of my peers appear to be under pressure to put up such huge amounts, due to peer pressure and societal expectation like a "norm".

How am I different?
I don't plan to spend on branded college, so there's a 50/50 chance I won't start saving until 4Y before college
I don't want to spend on luxury vacations as an "education" -- unnecessary and too costly
I do consider taking lower jobs to spend more time with kids.
I want to spend huge amount to cut my commute so I can spend more time with kids
I plan to spend on kids' non-academic pursuits, as Jenny on swimming, piano, coding, camps

--new Q: what's the best use of additional 100k (assuming you can't invest it)?
I will consider
* lower-paying job with more satisfaction
* more frq visits with grandparents
* vacations at nearby locations. There are plenty of world class yet low-cost destinations in SEA and China. No Japan no Korea please -- luxury and unnecessary. Our family life isn't less complete without them.

--new: cake: better buy small slice
big ice-cream/cake is cheaper but more damaging than small slices.

Small slice is expensive but relieves me of the struggle, pain and guilt of overeating.

My last experience – big slice of choco cake from CakeHistory … unable to leave half to next day

--new: strategic needs a re-definition
jolt
(I used to update this thing in gmail or blog directly)

"Strategic" needs a re-definition. quant and c# were two wake-up calls that I tragically missed.

For a long time, the #1 strategic t-expense was quant, then c#/c++QQ, then codingDrill (the current yellowJersey).

Throughout 2019, I considered workout time as inferior to coding drill .. Over weekends or evenings I often feel nothing-done even though I push myself to do "a bit of" yoga, workout, or math-with-boy, exp tracking, 

Now I feel yoga and other fitness t-spend is arguably more strategic than tech muscle building. I say this even though fitness improvement may not last.
Fitness has arguably the biggest impact on brain health and career longevity
