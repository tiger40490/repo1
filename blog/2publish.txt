--update myCarePlus
what if I emigrate?
Can I downgrade to a smaller amount?

Is premium amount in addition to eldershiled premium?

premium represents a $250/M burn rate .. a bit too high in my ffree

Risk of over-protection. Sizing should be done based on needs.. as we aren't affluent. 

Can I buy multiple policies and terminate one of them when no longer needed?
