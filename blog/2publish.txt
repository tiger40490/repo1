See also blogpost on Luke Su and spare time accounting
First let me present my pratical (hopefully valuable) quantification of spare time: excluding required work time (+commute), essential family-support time (+repairs), bio-time (sleep, nutrition/preparation)
Second, let's name the G3 non-overlapping allocations excluding the hard-to-estimate unused time. Note Blogging is a "mixin" element.
* 20% pff. Am reducing it from 40%
* 20% parenting including seeking help. Am increasing it from 5%
* 20% workout + wellness research; tech xx including localSys + body-building
* 40% other blogging

If I put in more than 3 items, then I tend to spend too much time fine-tuning the estimates but these estimates are not so useful in hind sight.

--update public ives
In terms of reputation, some of the public ives (Berkeley, ) are comparable to some original ives.
Fees or acceptance rate can be much better.

If brand is not that important to me, then we should favor the public ives.

In terms of acceptance rate, I think UChicago is much tougher than NUS, and more exclusive.

-- update post on Jiang.Zhu
I guess he is more of a tech lead, not a mgr, not a product visionary, not an technopreneur

At his level, he can't slack off and adopt an semi-retired ezlife

-- new: [21] chat with Alina #
The CTO is a workholic, working 10am - 1am. I see wrong priorities in that, esp. viewed at the deathbed. The company, the profit, is not an achievement considered worthwhile in the END.
Those achievements are part of personal "success" only in the exclub sense.

I told Alina my priorities have shifted to wellness [longevity, 5/wk] as I need more money only half-heartedly. I think this is similar to MMM attitude.

How much is "enough money"? Remember the latency discussion, and other blogposts.

Alina shared her experience about renting, and said she really wanted home ownership. I find this sentiment rather deep-rooted. Those young professionals in top China cities seem to be trapped. Residential properties are pushed (by hot money) beyond their reach. Many people probably want to avoid this "game" but they also feel renting is not sustainable not satisfactory.
I feel U.S. culture is different. Many smart Americans (including some middle-class Americans) stay renting long-term by choice.

Taking a step back, I guess my /drive/ towards ctbz/economizing, breakaway, conserver/minimalistic lifestyle, focus on livelihood(not FOFO),,, is hard for many in Alina's cohort. I guess that's why my level of carefree Fuller wealth is possibly beyond their reach(望尘莫及).

-- new: desparate: healthy lifestyle
Kenneth.Lew is the first to mention "desperate" in the RTS gym.

Daily stretch is supposed to be essential, but evidence is too weak to change people's behavior. 
I wonder what convincing evidence would provide sufficient absorbency for daily 1m practice.
I wonder what convincing evidence would provide sufficient absorbency for daily 30m practice.

workout 5 days a week is the recommendation, but 90% of adults can't find the absorbency/time.

Daily flossing is recommended but I won't do it until my teeth give me big big problems.

Frequent refresh is important to my son's academic studies, but he doesn't recognize it.

-- update solitude
Many old men (few women) sitting in bus interchange to avoid loneliness. 
A job would provide better connectedness, though it is a dependency

-- new: chin-up
A realistic goal would be one a day, but such a goal doens't generate positive feedback. 
I remember my yoga goal was one minute a day. I managed to change my perception to feel good about it.

For chin-up, I need the same change of perception.

retraining chin-up (and stretch) is dreadful but not push-up or cardio

My self-talk matters. My self-talk reflects my perception of reality. This perception affects my actions.

I guess my target for chin-up is too high. I typically aim at 10 chin-up or 40 push-up in a session. 

I think the start-up is harder for chin-up. 5 chin-up = 20 push-up.

-- update yoga frq (which blogpost?)
at twice a week, the total hours would be 3 to 5/wk, based on my Bayonne experience. This is much more than the hours I can allocate to all other workouts combined. Therefore, the tcost is unsustainable.

Reality is, yoga isn't life-saving like kidney dialysis that must be performed weekly. Most guys are unable to do 3 sessions/week and therefore 3 sessions/week is unrealistic for most people, just like 5 workouts/week. 

The sustainable tcost has to be based on self-practice.

-- new: tough yoga classes: take it ez@@
why the yoga instructors give such tough instructions? Because some students can do it !

In contrast, cardio classes don't make me feel so bad because instructions are reasonable to me, but probably unreasonable to some students.

Not easy to tell yourself "If I can't follow the instruction then I just take things easy." The whole point of coming to the class is the team environment.

-- update blogpost on dependency
With dental hygiene, I rely on frequent dental scaling to compensate for flossing.

The t$cost@scaling is tolerable in SG but will someday become less available, and resemble the yoga situation.

-- update https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/2019/12/01/yoga4life-regular-practice/
The challenge is mostly in the mind.

I was able to climb at least one flight of stairs every day when living in Blk 177 or #1173. 

-- new: Opera install
I generally prefer portable versions as they are easier in restricted environments. 
Therefore, the substantial effort in learning/exploration generates higher ROTI.
The regular download can create a a portable installation. It has comparable features as regular Opera, but it can't use the preserved bookmarks :(
To use preserved bookmarks, we need the regular install, but please don't install it into C:\programPortable, please!

I prefer the specific download with a version number and x64/x86. The default download is ambiguous can could install into a misleading location.

If free space is insufficient, the aborted installation can leave behind a litter of 200MB. If you don't clean it up manually, then in the future you won't recognize it as litter.

-- new: NIC, 4 little dragons
The original term "Newly Industrialized Countries" referred to these 4 east Asian economies

The current list is very interesting.

South Africa is the only NIC in Africa.
Mexico and Brazil are the only NICs in Latam, probably leading economies.
Among BRIC, only Russia is not an NIC.

Asian NICs are mostly in SEA except China and India. So in Asia, the "rich list" has Japan on top, the 4 little dragons below it, then SEA, then China and India. The rest are nowhere. My view is similar to the Flying Geese paradigm.

-- update low profile: reduce kidnapp risk: avoid flaunt
Don't share financial or personal information online, esp about your kids or physical locations. (If you share financial status, then highlight your limitations.)

It takes effort and risks for the gang to kidnap someone, so they seek high-return-low-risk-low-effort targets. 

-- update blog on 1st day back in office:
The recurring loss of family harmony is the most common reason I need the harbor of office. The library/stadium/MRT are also helpful.

-- update regular upkeep
dental retainers

--update blog on free books
As my collection of free books grows, I may realized there are too many books at home. It proved to be a recurring problem when moving home. Over the years, I have developed my preference for /travel-light/.

Jolt: Those individuals with a large book collection didn't move home as often ! They probably own many books that they seldom read. They were lucky to avoid facing the same reality I faced.

Sugg: proactively give away irrelevant books. This is slightly harder with books I bought.

Another reality with book ownership is -- our reading interests evolve with age.
Sugg: give away some titles that no longer appeal to me, perhaps after browsing through the TOC.
