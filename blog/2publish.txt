--new blogpost: c#^java/c++ journeys
my c# xx journey was exciting for a year but .. In contrast, my core-java/c++ (not jxee) journey has generated superior ROTI because 
* the interview topics are stable 
* I was able to stick to these career directions

However, most of the java5 new features are out of fashion in interviews. How about j8 features?

leverage? c# is lower but not bad. See separate blogpost
