--new: Ashish/MLP IV: QQ^GTD
I feel Ashish's MLP IV experience again proves the relative importance of GTD vs QQ

His GTD capacity is evident, but high-end interviews always discount/dismiss GTD and focus on QQ instead, including "problem-solving" as the young bbg interviewer put it.

Tanvil's self-description is revealing, but Ashish is a better example as I know him better than I know other peers.

Viswa is another example. 

GTD superstars are typically not recognized experts. They fail the expertise-benchmark.
