-- new: parenting: minimum weekly dedicated hours 
I would say a lot of the parenting hours can be non-dedicated such as but not limited to multi-tasking.

Quality time is not all dedicted hours. Dedicted hours are not all quality time.

Q: what's the minimum amount of dedicated parenting time, given mother's dedication?
A: zero, as long as my kids are not in need of me.

Imagine a parent with 15 (including adopted) children. I think he can be an effective parent.

Some parents work 6 or 7 days a week, over long commute. They can be effective parents.

Personal experience: I had been working away for many years. 

Not spending a lot of dedicated hours with kids is not unacceptable. In fact face time is dangerous.

-- new: wind-down tcost: to be embraced
Opening eg: In Bayonne, after every yoga+pull-up workout, I would spend about 2 hours shopping to wind down. It's a kind of reward, so that the prospect of the next session is not so off-putting. 

The wind-down is a necessary tcost, due to human nature. I don't think there's any superhuman, not in my dad, in Wenqiang, in Rahul. 

In a way, this wind-down is comparable to sleep. Sleep is not a waste of precious time. Sleep is a positive element our human life. 

The wind-down is a replenishment/recharge/recuperation and should be seen in a positive light.

If the wind-down is enjoyable, then be grateful.

.. speed coding exercise .. is very taxing, depleting my reserve. 
.. QQ learning is more enjoyable than speed coding exercise and require less wind-down.
.. my son's green zone..
