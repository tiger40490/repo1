== update post on AMB course j4
need lots of sunshine (time and mental energy) and absorbency to overcome the initial learning curve. 
I think this is similar to CSY's attitude on coding drill.
It is also similar to my yoga practice. Now I share my yoga story with so many friends, as inspiration, even though I'm not highly successful.

-- j4 wpress course
The wpress course is heavy on page look-n-feel customization.
I hate this aspect and would not make good progress without this course.
I already spent real money on dhost. This is one way to leverage on that. I can set up multiple subdomains each for a landing page. My advantage over other newbies.
I already spent huge effort learning wpress. this is one way to leverage on that.
wpress has many books in library. Am good at learning from books.

a contact form is required if you want to build mailing list
Can add it to my existing blogs.
Need to remember the product, so I can name the forms like f185/f872 for prodA/prodB
This design is my advantage, even though visual design is not.

bluehost is well-regarded. hostgator is comparable to dreamhost in terms of
* pricing, 
* uptime .. usually "99%" 
* suppport .. 24/7 chat+email
* one-click WP install.

-- slow cooking update 4 def@success or new: quiet idle time
Let's give shortcodes to the 4 definitions
successE: ezlife...
successZ: zqbx
successL: legacy, lasting achievements
success1: the first and most common def@success

Q: At my age and my level of ffree, why do I still worry about coblood waste, and too much idle time?
A: Well, ezlife is not "complete" success as it captures one dimension of success. zqbx is another crucial dimension of success

Time wasted in pain, or other unintended wastes of time are always regrettable and should be minimized. 
Time wasted due to inefficiency is questionable.

Planned idle time can be free of pain.
I guess LKY in his twilight years decided to learn meditation.

To me, quiet idle time is a prolonged period of doing nothing, free of extraneous stimuations. Boredom can be good, as a BBC program reported.
I guess quiet idle time can be a deeper recharge but today I will assume this deeper recharge doesn't work for everyone.

I think quiet idle time is not bad for some retirees and some younger people. So far, I have limited appreciation for quiet idle time.  Jacob of ERE pointed out the "freedom TO" challenge. 90% of the time, I still have goals, and purposes and I still push myself towards them. 
One growing purpose is the need to live longer for my kids. (Longevity requires long-term effort, practice and time.) I feel I can add value to their lives. If I live longer, I can better control my surplus assets and decide how to use it to help my children and possibly their children.

Healthy longevity may benefit from quiet idle time, not strictly traditional meditation.

A quasi idle time is the broad category including musical instrument, calligraphy, painting/drawing, wife's handcrafting, knitting

-- slow-cooking update post on Jiang.Zhu
Consider JackZ and Raymond's situations. At my age and (my economic) level, what endeavors (spaceshuttle name) are really strategic?
1) wellness lifestyle improvements like yoga, sustainable diet habits, BMI
2) dev-till-70 accu, plowback,,, including QQ and CIV
? academic parenting? No. I prioritize motivation, bonding, coaching 
? prepare for relocation to U.S. including car ownership, burn rate control

Jiang.Zhu is an unknown LeadEngineer figure that I last met in 1991. Both him and the Fenix CTO are largely unknown personalities, so my mental picture of them are imagined and fabricated content fitted onto a half-skeleton.
I guess for both of them, there is still a lot of untapped potential, a lot of drive, ambition. Compared to them, I probably look lazy. 
Well, at my age whenever I look out towards the deathbed I feel those "things" are unimportant.

Similarly to my "laziness", my son may look lazy. In contrast at age 13 I was more motivated, more ambitious than him.
