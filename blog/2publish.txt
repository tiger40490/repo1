-- new: physical USD out of China
Exit from China custom... USD 5k/passenger.. including children :)
PVG security officer found my cash pouch and sent that item through the scanner all by itself! Officer made no noise, presumably because she was looking for anything dangerous.
I think officer is "permitted" to either count the notes or "close one eye". Closing one eye, even under /CCTV/, is not negligence.

-- new: 30k cpfSA top-up
j4: yield
J4: lock down free cash against missteps or hackers
limitation -- very poor liquidity. Only Consider top-up after (not before) RBBT debt payoff

Suppose I want to top up 8k in 2024 to enjoy tax benefit:
wife's 2023 (pervious year) income must be < 8k including dividend, interest etc

-- update bpost on citi.sg
USD transfer Citi.sg -> other SG banks .. lowest cost is USD3 for each personal cheque. 
To receive a new cheque book, request online and pay $15
These are truly negligible costs in this era.

-- fuxi or update bpost on ffree in my family
grandparents have financial freedom due to healthcare and SGD 4k+/M of pension. This ffree is a big advantage esp. to the adult children, but it is not enough to make their lives a bliss.

-- new: Giro failure prevention
Background: Since early 2020s I have kept a low balance [1k+] in #108 .. actually insufficient for some oversized Giro deductions [3k+ for ADL insurance].

The stres after a Giro failure ... is something to pre-empt. Hard deadline. Hard interruption to whatever I was focused on. 

Sugg: calendar reminders. MyCarePlus every Feb 

Over the long horizon... As I grow older, Giro failures would be a low but burdensome complexity. Giro failures are usually recoverable since Payee institutions are usually lenient/flexible. Reason -- Among their thousands of paying customers, there will always be some percentage hitting Giro failures.

-- update bpost on sys1/sys2 overload
On a flight, "Less forgettable" items can still be forgotten and misplaced, due to sys1 limitations.
* passport
* laptop
* laptop cover
* bottle

I can relax and accept the possibility of losing travel pillow, yoga block

charging cables .. If you need to charge devices, do it early on the flight, and pack them up hours before landing, to reduce sys1 load.

--update bpost on features of epaJob
Some poeple don't need these "features", but I really enjoy my commute + EPA flexible hours ... I can work during quiet times (weekends, evenings) and take hours and hours off during the day.

Pretty rare among the jobs known to me.

-- update post on array^ptr
a ptr Object can be reseated to point to an array.
An arrayName (is not an object) can't be reseated. It's a compile-time constant.

-- new or fuxi: java: big lambdaEx^methodRef
I think a big lambdaEx (lambda expression) is usually used as an argument to a method. 

Q: can we convert the big lambdaEx to a method reference?
A: not alwaysl. In Dropcopy framework, I realized that 

* many times yes I can and should convert. LambdaEx is designed for small code blocks.
* however, if the lambdaEx uses captured variables, then conversion can be difficult. I think the new method has to add a new param for every captured variable.

-- update bpost on deep work
Learning something "strategic" is real work.
eg: Learning for a meaningful school exam is strategic -- NUS? MSFM?
eg: Coding drill is strategic and deep work.

Some learning can be less "real". Same can be said of various paid projects. In the DeepWork context, I won't use an elaborate criteria for "real" work.

-- update bpost on miles, ..
Somehow, MLP likes to retrench old timers !

-- update bpost on C
I often feel proud to say C was my first language.
Similarly, I feel proud to self-identify as a math graduate.

These domains are evergreen in terms of relevance and skill demand. 
Somehow my career[and learning] gravitates towards these /magnets/.

-- fuxi or update pff complexities 
If you feel too old or too busy, and don't want these pff complexities, then you pay for advice from banks or financial advisors.
Rarely you get free advisory service (remember FSM and Phillip) but often during the sale process only.

--update SRS account in DBS/posb
$15,300/Y max deposit into this account as tax exempt income. Tax saving of more than $2.7k/Y 
After 5Y (say 2030) can withdraw as 2030 income, but my tax bracket in 2030 would be the lowest, because first 40k in 2030 is not taxed in Singapore.

Before 2030, During the 5Y lock-in, withdrawal penalty is 5%. 

-- update bpost on buyback ^ div
Div is funded by profit. Buyback can be funded by debt

Div can cause an immediate price drop. In contrast, buyback has a long-term effect of boosting share price.

Buyback cuts shares outstanding, and usually increase per-share measures of profitability like earnings-per-share (EPS),  and improve performance measures like ROE.

You're not required to sell your shares when a buyback is initiated. If you keep your stocks, your percentage of ownership in the issuing company will increase as other investors sell theirs.

-- update bpost on buy-without
many purchases were bought-without-OTh but the rmSelf would inevitably become critical, and with guilt we will remember the purchase as a failure.
Out of sight, out of mind... I would feel less guilt if I get rid of the physical objects.

extra laptop .. now I feel a _burden_ to use it once a while to avoid disuse->oxidation
badminton net .. luckily, I didn't make the buying decision

Better than two overlapp tags (ugly proliferation)

Need an explanation bpost .. perhaps use one of the t_selfTalk bposts.

-- update bpost on longevity https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=48298&action=edit
In Dec 2023 I started to worry about quality_of_life in my mom's twilight years, either in a Beijing nursing home, or a Singapore nursing home, or living with my wife (while I'm away in the U.S.), against the backdrop of her declining health.

quality_of_life is another side of VV (one of the trio).

All the scenarios appear pathetic, unappealing, scary,,, As people grow old, they are bound to experience (some or all of) mobility decline, mental decline, living away from immediate family, or outside their own comfortable home. Inevitable for many in their 80s and beyond. 

Given an elderly's health, financial and family situation, his choices are often limited. If money is not the problem (willing suspension of disbelief), then perhaps he can live with family + adequate healthcare at home [R.Teo's dad?]. Hopefully (big hope), the in-law caregivers are able to cope, supported by plenty of external resources. This "acceptable" bar is too high to be realistic.

Before I can plan ahead, I have to give up on unrealistic expectations.

How about my ADL insurance? I now feel somewhat more vindicated. 

The more children and grandchildren I have, the more resources I have available in my old age.

-- new: livelihood shield won't fend off these"pains"
When we Struggle against or Cope with multiple /issues/, we often envy the affluent. We imagine their lives are less stressful, less frustrating, less burdened. Actually, "carefree bubble" depends on many factors such as number of dependents, amount of belongings (baggage), support network (citizenship?). However, this bpost is focused on the factor of livelihood (affluence). 

Even without livelihood issues/worries, some people (including my family-n-fiend) can feel real pains due to 
* physical pains
* psychological pains .. phobia, anxiety, depression...
* serious lack of self-discipline, or substance abuse, or addiction, in the self or a family member. Remember Biden's son.
* wasted personal potential? If livelihood fine, then the "waste" is tolerable?
* failure in love relationships (incl. non-starter)... "Affluence" doesn't meet this need.
* chronic family conflicts .. eg: me vs in-laws; between grandparents; sis vs grandpa
* injustice .. eg: See https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=24197&action=edit
* gross unfair treatment ... eg? losing a /rewarding/ job for a bitter reason like personality, or unfair dismissal

Bias of hindsight/rmSelf.. I would say a lot of times such an "event" does cause livelihood issues "for a while". Could be a few days to a few years. I guess many (rmSelf) dismiss the livelihood "stress" in hind sight, but in the midst of it the stress our xpSelf does feel non-trivial and permanent (just as covid19 felt like in 2020).

How about during the retirement phase? 
* work headaches reduced, but we may miss the engagement, the purpose, the F2F interaction. I would rather stay employed in a light-duty job, and endure some non-trivial stress
* Parenting pains reduced
* family conflict may reduce due to smaller family
* no more personal potential to waste
* I may be more dependent on others

-- update bpost on long service award
J4 using 3 laptops concurrently at home: 
keep every laptop actively maintained and monitored, so they don't come out of "warehouse" damaged by disuse
get used to no-touchscreen. 
get a concrete feel of how fast a 2023 entry-level laptop can be.
try out Win11 in various usage scenarios

-- new: PLN[powerline network] devices 
I have learnt from experience that PLN devices need ventilation and periodic power-down. I think they become hot quite easily.
My current pair of devices are identical :) and therefore interchangeable. 
One of them is easy to power-off, and gets more "rest". 
So I devised a plan to rotate them, so each one periodically rotates to the light-duty position. Is this a burdensome or reccreational complexity? R

I find PLN more reliable than wifi, nearly as reliable as ethernet. If that's true, then for some homes PLN is a superior solution in terms of complexity, wiring,,,, See https://tedium.co/2020/06/02/powerline-networking-history/

Whenever I need uninterrupted connectivity for telecommute, I avoid home wifi (including mesh)... too unstable. If I can't run a long cable across rooms, then PLN is my default choice.
