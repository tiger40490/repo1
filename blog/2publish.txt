According to a government survey, in megacities like Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, the housing-price-to-income ratio was above 35 – meaning that the price of an average house is equivalent to roughly 35 years of the average Household income.
Household size can be 1 or more.

Street dance ^ eGaming ^ speed coding
Street dance skill can't make money for you.
Singing is similar.
Piano is similar but .... can teach... There's a good demand.

basketball talent .. Top 0.1% can make money

Speed coding is very different. Many companies are interested to hire you.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/crypto-ftx-sbf-bankrupt-crash-binance-3068201 says
The value in crypto was supposed to be that it offered a hedge to the dollar or more conventional parts of the market. Or that it would hold up in value if everything else fell. But an asset that offers that kind of hedge is rare; most assets are somewhat correlated, especially when the market drops. Rareness normally means an expensive asset that offers a lower return. You pay a big price for that kind of safety and it’s hard to find. The fact that crypto offered such high returns indicated it was never a good hedge.

-- update (which?) bpost on car ownership
Trigger: Singapore consumer education promotes public transport, walk, cycle, rather than private cars.

The wellness factor (including mental) and eco factor are background heat (a home-grown term not laden with meanings).

Some frequent drivers (7+ trips/wk) may pass all health screenings. If you are one of them, you may not care about the backgroune heat. 
You may feel your "system" can cope with the background heat.
However, over decades these factors tend to grow /heavier/, less negligible, and accmulate an enduring (positive/negative) effect on a person's life chances and well-being.

-- new: triple trip2fetch phone left@home: +ve perception
Today I left my mobile phone at home, so I came to office and quickly decided to go back and fetch it. 
In the same situation, I used to feel bitter/resentful precisely because I focused on the negative side:
* family members unable to help me.
* I would have to pay a few dollars for commute 
* I have just arrived in office and have not done any work
* I must return to office (rather than working from home) due to a meeting [PMA walk through]
* I will miss a 3pm meeting, though I could try to dial in during my commute

Just 2 or 3 items were enough to paint the whole thing bloody.

Instead, this time I focused on the positive elements:
* my workload is low, without urgent deliverables
* my work hours are more flexible than most jobs
* my commute is rather short, with minimal walk on both ends
* I could read on the train, with a seat

This is a simple and powerful illustration of positive perception.

SG was behind HK in the talent race, as HK draws talents from China + the west.
Now SG is becoming more attractive than HK for many nationalities:
* SEAsia
* India
* the West
* Japan? China is anti-Japan

~~ some long-term disadvantages of sg 
vulnerable to global warming
burning oil to generate electricity
limited fresh water supply .. even though gov is working effectively on reservoirs, river cleaning, catchment
food insecurity
very limited scale in some job domains. For those interested in those domains, they may need to work overseas.
over-dependent on foreign workers and foreign talents

-- update... https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/10950/bmi-flexible-cre-strength/?
After the meet-up with YY.T, I realized fitness is not a priority to me.

Longevity
freedom from illness
intimacy
good sleep and appetite
BMI .. seems to be a key indicator/predictor of many of the above.


-- update which bpost on inflation? https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/1551/2022era-of-peak-cpi-inflation/ ?
in Aug 2022, UK energy bill per household was projected to hit SGD 500/M, representing 11% of the median disposable income per household.

My reaction when I read it? Not much. I imagined my own total bill (curently SGD 200) rising to SGD 500, and I told myself we would simply cut consumption. Realistically how low can we cut to? Perhaps down to $400. That's still huge inflation but not a big hit on my family burn rate.... compared to big tickets like MSFM, Mindchamps, maid, IRAS

That's one straw on the camel's back, not the last straw.

-- slowcooking upate resilience
Americans, Mainland Chinese... receive less support from the state. "You are on your own." they were told. Such a message is rarely given to SG citizens. Sg citizens are often reliant on the nanny state. I guess this is similar to other small nations like Finland, Norway, Luxemburg,,, 

The reliance is evident in many diverse domains.

However, Singaporeans as a whole is a fairly resilient nation, as shown in numerous crises [covid, SARS, 1997AFC...]. We are resilient in spite or because of our reliance on each other. 

Same can be said of a family. Kids rely on parents. Siblings lean on each other. 

I guess a small school, a small company are also like small nations -- tight-knit group. 

There are individuals who don't need to rely on others. They appear to be resilient in the lone wolf sense, but I don't know how common they are, or how strong they actually are. 
I guess in most cases, resilient people tap on a "support network" rather than act as lone wolves. 

One of the most intimate illustrations is counselling, like sexual issues, phobias, obsessions, addictions, behavior issues. Optimism (in the Lone-wolf sense) is just a word, often a weak and ineffective word by itself. Positive thinking is .. ditto. In half the non-trivial cases, the individual needs guidance and a helping hand. Dependency yes, but that's real resilience for real people.

~toilet blue flush
I used to think this is unnecessary lifestyle creep. Now I think it can 
* reduce water consuption because wife (and I) will not "flush again" when the blue conceals the light-yellow. Half flush never worked with my wife.
* reduce conflict with my wife

-- slowcooking new: career insecurity: 2017 watershed #marathon
t_vague
2017 marked a watershed in my perception of career insecurity.
Before the watershed, I had a "learned insecurity", instilled in me due to decades of brainwash, and internalized.

tech churn .. defeating any attempt of accumulation
The widespread and entrenched notion that "Few can remain hands-on till 40."
threat from younger or stronger competitors.
DRam refresh .. and maintain your critical mass
strengthen your moat, maintain your lead 
Don't drop out from the leading pack.
slow income growth outpaced by long-term (CPIx) inflation not only in home prices.

I felt like a (less successful version of) EDB -- can't afford to slow down, because of the constant risk of getting outrun/outmaneuvered, or caught up... The risk of losing our relevance.

After the watershed, I could see the end of my IN-voluntary marathon. Now am planning my own light marathon driven by successZ. 
This marathon could take me all the way to 70s. 
I hope to enjoy it.
Therefore, for the remainder of the marathon I could afford to slow down to a stroll, drop out of the leading pakc, and let other people overtake me, as happend in Toa Payoh stadium jogging track.

I told SY.C that my 100k/Y dev-till70 is not passive acceptance and failureZ, because I still make an effort -- a light maratho is still a marathon.
