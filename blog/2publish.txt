--new: q3SG phase t-utilization 
History is a mirror

too much low-quality time with boy. 
Need to be more calculating on tcost. Beware of long trips, though boy really appreciates some of them.

msfm? Huge tcost like 10~15h/week per subject, but this is often a absorbency honeymoon. I learnt a lot, though the strategic value is not considered questionable.

personal investment? too much tcost on fsm + oanda

extra time in office? too much non-work

yoga? insufficient positive feedback, too much physical pain, slightly too much $cost pressure

You said I'm now pretty good at coding interviews. I said I was just lucky.

Now I think I deserve a pat on my back. I worked hard for years and took up hundreds of coding questions from leetcode or elsewhere. 

Did the huge effort help me grow stronger? Yes

--new: long-term roti=rare; prejudice about fun time with boy
jolt
What kinda individuals like to point a finger at a school and say "So many students have failed to score 600 marks on gaokao"?

Real long-term roti is rare like a perfect score:
* yoga? not lasting
* QQ? so fake
* coding test? Only for web 2.0 shops
* per investment? mostly small scale and recreational
* ...
So why the hell do I point my figer at family time, boy's coaching sessions, outing with boy, fun time with boy, relaxed time with boy?

Any relaxed moment is seen as too easy and not burning enough. Such a burn/rot view is poisonous, and double-standard -- I don't point my finger at
* myself blogging
* myself watching youtube
* myself on recreational reading 
* myself reading news, magazines

I have been utterly prejudiced in my assessment of family-time utilization. 
* yoga -- considered not burn and low ROTI... Actually extremely hard. Arguably more strategic than the coding drill etc, 
* work out with kids -- considered not burn and low ROTI (too much wasted time) .. Actually tough, and builds family bound. Arguably no less strategic than QQ
* strength training -- considered not burn, not hard enough.
* prepare math worksheet -- considered not burn, not hard enough, not strategic, not related to my career
* review zbs -- considered not burn not IV-relevant.
* review GTD -- considered not burn not IV-relevant.
* review QQ -- considered not burn and not strategic
* bring boy out shopping as reward for him -- considered high tcost low ROTI but extremely important to his +/-ve feedback loop 

Overall, I was fixated on materialistic ROTI and self-discipline over the lazy self

--new: clarity@thinking=non-trivial strength

clarity of thinking is a non-trivial strength in me. Many friends say I'm very reflective and demonstrate Grade-A self knowledge and self analysis. 

I feel many "peers" don't show clarity of thinking. My sis, dad show clarity. I think my son may have it.

Vocab is a top-4 factor and can help a lot, esp. when a common phrase is ambiguous and confusing. To my surprise, many clear thinkers seem to use mostly a small vocab.

I explain my content very clearly to myself, not always so clearly to "them". In my view , clarity of thought is mostly a self-management skill, so I don't worry about "them".

Brevity is perhaps a top 5 clarity factor. I tend to be good in brevity of writing but Some verbal-type individuals show exceptional clarity. Genn?

My use of spreadsheet is a visual sign of clarity
