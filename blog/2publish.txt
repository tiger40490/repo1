--new jolt: time spent blogg`about boy=therapeutic
Time spend blogging about boy is therapeutic. 

Also, the time spent preparing his math worksheet is therapeutic -- a landed punch; am able to focus, calm down and make (albeit slow) progress; gaining traction rather than wheel-spinning

I'm good at these even though they take up huge amount of energy and precious quiet time.
Luckily I don't feel worn out by these efforts.

I feel at my age, parenting IS a main job, comparable to my day job. 
Actually, Career progression is NOT my main responsibility at this stage of my life.
