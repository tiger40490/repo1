--new (soul-search): superior absorbency domains
When in sky-high absorbency, I should try and take on the really tough. When in "good" absorbency, I should take on the medium tough jobs.

Compare to my peers, I have superior Long-term absorbency on these specific challenges:
* jogging, but not stretching
* push-up but not chin-up
* QQ study but not coding drill -- major competition
* eating raw veg but not celery
* delaying meals but not reducing dinner

These long-term absorbency advantages are life-enhancing, too put it mildly

--update: old timers are safe in some teams like MLP, but not in MS

--Q: if I declare a huge int array in static memory, will the object file become huge?

This is possibly a QQ nlg pearl, a halo zbs, not GTD
