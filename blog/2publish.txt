--new blogpost: dev-lead IV is not as easy as they think
re: Ashish's promotion and Kyle discussion
The financial reward can be big but not the only reinforcement of absorbency, engagement, sustained focus ... There may not be orgro, thick->thin, any portable GTD skills. 
Those who commit to localSys are rarely promoted, as explained in numerous blogposts. 
GS was a watershed defining experience in my career. #2 experience is probably Stirt. Since big bonuses are utterly unreliable, FTE career is comparable to a contract career financially, but inferior in terms of stress, self-esteem etc.

As Kyle pointed out, there must be some intrinsic motivation in the Ashishes and Rahuls. "Traction" and "engaging" are the words I would use, but I doubt there's any thick->thin or orgro. 

I feel Ashish commits more personal energy than his colleagues do on localSys because he derives some joy. 
In contrast, I commit more personal energy than other candidates on QQ (and to a lesser extent coding drill) because I derive some joy.

Given a choice between localSys xx vs QQ (or coding drill), I would not choose localSys, because of accu, portable t-investment. This is a key reason for my mediocre experiences .

Passing the tech interview to get a dev-lead role isn't easy. It can upgrade your career, but candidate competition can be tough. 
So I think my ex-colleagues need a lot of effort to pass those interviews. 
Just look at CSY, Deepak and my own attempt to get into HFT .. how many failures and how much t-investment needed.

It takes more than on-the-job learning. It takes months or years of absorbency, sustained focus... Most of us underestimate that "bar" until we try and fail repeatedly to clear it.

--update blogpost on greenfield^brownfield:
it's actually not hard to build some new "mkt data engine" as Quoine's Richard did over a few months, since greenfield is much simpler than brownfield. 

Sundip wrote an prototype of StirtRisk over a week, but the really big effort is the build-out from prototype to finished product.

Kenny of Trecquant designed something really simple that supposedly does the same job as a 100-man-year system, 

I created a FIX engine over a few hours.

I implemented a basic order book over a few hours even when I was new to c++
