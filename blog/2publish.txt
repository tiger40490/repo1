--new: good at pushing myself
am good at pushing myself to the limit, sometimes beyond my limit, even if i may not be "good at" them in a competitive sense.
* yoga
* jogging
* coding drill
* camp out

coding drill is arguably the most interesting case study. Other people may complete more problems, but i probably spend more time
* Ranked by number of problems, i'm just average
* ranked by hours spent, I'm much higher
* ranked by effort, I'm even higher, as I push myself harder than others

--new: cod`drill: student^mathematician
A student's approach to statistics is different from a mathematician's. Likewise, I feel the intern way of coding drill is not good for me
* not long-term commitment. I believe most of them would stop after getting a job.
* not in-depth
* not aimed at deep learning and retention
* more like cram

However an unbiased interviewer/observer could find the student stronger than a mathematician!

--new blogpost cod`drill outlasting C++self-study
Am confident that my coding drill will become a "long-term" hobby like java/c++ QQ, better than c#/quant/swing QQ. 

Anti-aging.

Enjoyable? Yes possible and real if no pressure. 

Not theoretical; more immediate result

I think coding drill may even outlast c++ QQ self-study but crucially my c++ QQ has reached critical mass.
