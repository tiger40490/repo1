--new: Q: what I want boy to gain from this crazy SG math program@@
* word problem-solving techniques? No. Too contrived and not needed in u.s. high school(?) or in adult life
* arithmetic proficiency. Note ratios and decimal point shift don't need calculator
* absorbency and perseverance to applying his mind and recall what he learned before?
* not giving up? I doubt he can learn this skill better in the SG system than in U.S.
* self-discipline and perseverance? I doubt it.

* chart reading
* science
* English reading as a pleasure ... so precious
* Chinese reading and guessing

--new blog: PSLE is serious
事实上, 美国轻松的学校很多都不是好学校. 美国中学生也要竞争, 也有考试, 也有难题, 也需要坚持和努力, 不学无术的学生大都没有好出路, 只能被淘汰到社会底层.

我曾计划大宝来美, 家住北昂小镇, 能进所谓天才班, 但如果他现在不努力, 恐怕到时候进不去.

考虑正式参加 PSLE, 一家人共同经历这个磨难。 爷爷说也许是件好事， 好像军训. 学习生涯不都是轻松自在的. 压力,磨难有时免不了. 竞争, 是注定免不了的.

在美国, 要上好大学得从 15 岁开始竞争. 也是有压力的.

学习是任务, 不喜欢也得接受. 
作业是繁重, 但别的同学能做完, 我们也能.

我们总说大宝不努力。 我没有给他足够的夸奖， 爸爸做的不够。

可以考虑给他一些压力。 这个年岁可以承受一些压力 （包括数学作业）。 但避免厌学。 

我还是提倡温和地坚持。 学习和作业的目标就定为考分。 每天学习最少30分钟， 要他自己认同而不是家长强加的。

完不成学习任务的后果最好是自然的，要不就是他自选的， 而不是家长制造出的后果。 怎么把"后果"和奖励结合呢？

不甘下游...

--new: planning to reduce boy's math workload
我下半年回新工作后， 会逐渐减少大宝的繁重作业， 因为对孩子学习帮助不大。 

比如数学难题， 做很多还是掌握不了。 也许他的同学能掌握， 那可能是他们能承受反复练习， 大宝没他们的耐力， 或许不应归罪为孩子的错。 

我决心做有智慧和胆识的家长。 数学这科我学的最久， 有自己的体会，观点。 我的决策，基于我的亲身体会和我对大宝的观察， 应该比老师更有根据。 老师的优势， 在于对同年龄学生的了解

--new blogpost: I have a problem seeing dabao having fun
I think I have a problem seeing him having fun. I hate to see him enjoying the fun without doing his part.

Both parents probably feel he is too fun-loving. I feel he doesn’t want to earn the right to have fun.

Grandpa felt it’s normal. 

--new: perseverance #Goh
For non-word problems, I think i should support perseverance.

For word problems, tough choice for me.
I feel encouraging him to solve tougher word problems sounds like 拔苗助长

I kinda see Ms Goh's view. Boy is not trying enough, and relying on other people to do the thinking for him.

Perseverance (willpower) is questionable practice and often fails in many cases. In this case, teacher is very sure and wife also believes it.

My arithmetic drill is doable and requires perseverance; Probably ditto for the easy word problems (some at P3/P4 levels);
Some word problems that require equation .. he has no confidence so perseverance is possibly ineffective.

fatigue and 厌学?

confrontation, strain, losing-cool

key to perseverance -- 温和

compare the P1 spelling experiences -- 3 hours to learn 10 words. I tried teaching him the patterns but completely failed as he was not engaged.

compare the piano perseverance.

邓丽君 was weak in math as a pupil but showed perseverance.

.. perseverance4boy #yoga as personal experience
am not good at yoga, but I make a serious effort trying.
I guess relatively few people are like me. Karma

I guess for my son the math practice feels like yoga to some extent??

--new: t-spillage]workout
eg: 10 min actual swim takes 30 min in the water, and at least 1 hour total due to commute + shower etc
eg: 50 min yoga class requires about 3H including wind-down.

For these workouts, if you try to reduce the 'spillage' you may hit a stonewall.

eg: jogging has much lower spillage
eg: mini-workout has the lowest spillage

I used to undervalue the Roti of workout
Now I feel prioritizing workout (over other t-spend) means accepting the spillage
