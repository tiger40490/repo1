Let's give shortcodes to the 4 definitions
successE: ezlife...
successZ: zqbx
successL: legacy, lasting achievements
success1: the first and most common def@success

Q: At my age and my level of ffree, why do I still worry about coblood waste, and too much idle time?
A: Well, ezlife is not "complete" success as it captures one dimension of success. zqbx is another crucial dimension of success

Time wasted in pain, or other unintended wastes of time are always regrettable and should be minimized. 
Time wasted due to inefficiency is questionable.

Planned idle time can be free of pain.
I guess LKY in his twilight years decided to learn meditation.

To me, quiet idle time is a prolonged period of doing nothing, free of extraneous stimuations. Boredom can be good, as a BBC program reported.
I guess quiet idle time can be a deeper recharge but today I will assume this deeper recharge doesn't work for everyone.

I think quiet idle time is not bad for some retirees and some younger people. So far, I have limited appreciation for quiet idle time.  Jacob of ERE pointed out the "freedom TO" challenge. 90% of the time, I still have goals, and purposes and I still push myself towards them. 
One growing purpose is the need to live longer for my kids. (Longevity requires long-term effort, practice and time.) I feel I can add value to their lives. If I live longer, I can better control my surplus assets and decide how to use it to help my children and possibly their children.

Healthy longevity may benefit from quiet idle time, not strictly traditional meditation.

A quasi idle time is the broad category including musical instrument, calligraphy, painting/drawing, wife's handcrafting, knitting

-- slow-cooking update post on Jiang.Zhu
Consider JackZ and Raymond's situations. At my age and (my economic) level, what endeavors (spaceshuttle name) are really strategic?
1) wellness lifestyle improvements like yoga, sustainable diet habits, BMI
2) dev-till-70 accu, plowback,,, including QQ and CIV
? academic parenting? No. I prioritize motivation, bonding, coaching 
? prepare for relocation to U.S. including car ownership, burn rate control

Jiang.Zhu is an unknown LeadEngineer figure that I last met in 1991. Both him and the Fenix CTO are largely unknown personalities, so my mental picture of them are imagined and fabricated content fitted onto a half-skeleton.
I guess for both of them, there is still a lot of untapped potential, a lot of drive, ambition. Compared to them, I probably look lazy. 
Well, at my age whenever I look out towards the deathbed I feel those "things" are unimportant.

Similarly to my "laziness", my son may look lazy. In contrast at age 13 I was more motivated, more ambitious than him.
