--new blogpost: #1 gain{SG3jobs
All three jobs were java-lite and have some quantDev exposure.

Through these jobs, I gained the crucial clrity about the reality of quantDev direction, and stopped the brave but costly tsn attempts to secure a foothold. Footfhold is too tough and futile.
Instead, I successfully established c#/py/c++ trec.  The c++ accu was very difficult and precious.

Without these progresses, I would be lacking the confidence in py/c#/c++ to get multiple job offers. I would still be stuck in the quantDev direction

--new blogpost: if I had stayed within java
I think every tsn experience and proposal has some "buts". Does it mean we should stop trying? No. If I had stayed within java/sql/perl then I would have been worse off.... fewer job opportunities,  less broadended techncial base
more worry about job security
more wrroy about churn
more worry about outsourcing
no differentition from regular java guys
sql and perl falling out of fashion

Was leverage good on my tsn attempts after GS? Yes

Compare me against a java guy having only one big long java project, who has more zbs and GTD power, including
* performance tuning in thread pool, DB interface, serialization
* hot-swap anre remote debugging
* JMX

--update offline sheet [[predict job satisfaction]]
Many of the top factors are "perceptions" rather than "hardships"

perceptions -- seld-esteem@comp; strategic tsn; engaging. #best eg@perception -- peer comparison
hardships -- mkt depth; workload; family time; commute
