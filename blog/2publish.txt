.. outstanding dues
I will wait for NCT to tell me what to do. You can tell the tenant that I will take care of the dues.

If really necessary, I will pay the outstanding and request for refund.

.. additional accessories
Please reply on this email thread with the items. I believe the tenant can set up and pay for the accessories themselves. Tenant can make their selections without me.

If tenant want me to pay for it, I feel it's debatable. I assume they are in a hurry and don't want a start a lengthy negotiation on such a trivial matter.

Why debatable -- this unit is brand new. For any defect, you and I (enlisting Megaworld) will take care of it. If tenant wants major modification, then owner can turn down (as per lease contract). If only minor changes then tenant is free to do so as per lease contract, at their own cost.

--new jolt: time spent blogg`about boy=therapeutic
Also, the time spent preparing his math worksheet is therapeutic.

I'm good at these even though these take up huge amount of energy and precious quiet time.
Luckily I don't feel worn out by these efforts.

I feel at my age, parenting IS a main job, comparable to my day job. 
Actually, Career progression is NOT my main responsibility at this stage of my life.
