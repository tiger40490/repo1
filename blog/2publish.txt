-- upate bpost on addicted to employee benefits
In Macq, when I brought family in for pingpong, I was relying on staff benefits, assuming I was performing well to deserve everything.
-- update bpost on "something wrong"
With CAD, my appetite dropped suddenly. I stopped responding to tasty foods present in office or home.
Good or bad? I think it's good for my CAD condition. Adaptation.

-- new: bullied by shop assistants
A little more love for my still-intact heart... Frequent anger can affect blood pressure. My heart rate actually went up when confronting the bully. We get a burst of energy. If this happens often, it causes wear and tear on your artery walls. Research backs that up.

State your demnad like 'I hope you can accept your fault, and learn a lesson.' If the salesperson refuses, then at least I made my demand.

Speak slowly and avoid raising your voice.

Avoid attacking, which tends to invite counter-attacks and dangerous escalation of tension.

The salesperson is often young, untrained, and doing the job relunctantly.

-- new: XiaoYan meet-up
XiaoYan is a kind lady. I guess she decided to spend 1.5 hours learning about the world outside PSA, and sharing experiences and observations. As I told her, this meet-up turned out to be an insightful, reflective career counselling session. She was a helpful mirror. I revealed a lot of my fears, setbacks, weaknesses,,, and received substantial support.

She suggested that job stability could become a G3 priority for my next job search in Singapore. PSA and OC are profitable and stable places -- management are extremely reluctant to retrench, even for non-performing employees.

She shared that age concern over a 55-year-old candidate (8-Y career runway ) is a real concern at hiring discussions.

She mentioned a long-term contract staff.. capable and quiet but PSA was not keen to convert such contractors to perm because removing any perm staff is always costly and painful. Sounds like employers like PSA and OC would always wait for non-performing employees to resign, including employees with bad attitude.

I reveald that my salary is now "very high" by my standard, possibly overpaid, so much so that I don't mind buying her an expensive juice. She pointed out that unlike many people in such overpaid/underworked situations, I'm conscientious about the possibility of "overpaid without heavy workload or contribution". Deep inside, I felt a warm pat on the back.

On the other hand, many people in the same firm feel underpaid as a group. This is similar to Americans feeling bad about their education systems or Sgrns feeling bad about natioal housing condition. If indeed I'm underpaid relative to the industry, then the above-mentioned "overpaid" concern is not a serious risk.

She asked why I prefer SGP to U.S. if I could find an equivalent after-tax salary (after adjusting for cost of living). I mentioned close-to-grandparents, Chinese population (better for wife), better government support, weather,,, I forgot to mention driving, street safety, wife's career.

I realized that as I age I have become more loyal, less opinionated,,,,, but I still reject the widespread advice to "put up with worsening job situation for as long as you can tolerate"

-- new: why employers prefer resignation over layoff
Layoff/retrenchment has many ramifications for the employer --

* media coverage
* image, reputation
* regulators ... tend to protect the vulnerable i.e. employees rather than employers
* potential law suit by employee
* compulsory PIP
* severance 

In rare cases, the employee is found guilt of a breach. Employer has a right to terminate her without any obligation.

--update bpost on features of epaJob
Some poeple don't need these "features", but I really enjoy my commute + EPA flexible hours ... I can work during quiet times (weekends, evenings) and take hours and hours off during the day.

Pretty rare among the jobs known to me.

-- update post on array^ptr
a ptr Object can be reseated to point to an array.
An arrayName (is not an object) can't be reseated. It's a compile-time constant.

-- new or fuxi: java: big lambdaEx^methodRef
I think a big lambdaEx (lambda expression) is usually used as an argument to a method. 

Q: can we convert the big lambdaEx to a method reference?
A: not alwaysl. In Dropcopy framework, I realized that 

* many times yes I can and should convert. LambdaEx is designed for small code blocks.
* however, if the lambdaEx uses captured variables, then conversion can be difficult. I think the new method has to add a new param for every captured variable.

-- fuxi or update bpost on deep work
Learning something "strategic" is real work.
eg: Learning for a meaningful school exam is strategic -- NUS? MSFM?
eg: Coding drill is strategic and deep work.

Some learning can be less "real". Same can be said of various paid projects. In the DeepWork context, I won't use an elaborate criteria for "real" work.

-- update bpost on miles, ..
Somehow, MLP likes to retrench old timers !

-- update bpost on C
I often feel proud to say C was my first language.
Similarly, I feel proud to self-identify as a math graduate.

These domains are evergreen in terms of relevance and skill demand. 
Somehow my career[and learning] gravitates towards these /magnets/.

-- fuxi or update pff complexities 
If you feel too old or too busy, and don't want these pff complexities, then you pay for advice from banks or financial advisors.
Rarely you get free advisory service (remember FSM and Phillip) but often during the sale process only.
