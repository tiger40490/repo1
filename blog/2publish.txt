-- new: 2FA for financal sites
Now I understand the need for 2FA.
U.S. ebanking sites don't use 2FA and therefore someone can steal my password and impersonate me !

-- new Sgp Doctor income
http://www.salaryexplorer.com/salary-survey.php?loc=196&loctype=1&job=13&jobtype=2#disabled has figures for 50+ specializations.
From the comparison, you can get a feel of where each specialization stands in the pack.

https://www.salary.sg/2007/doctors-pay/ is fairly realistic.

-- new: hypothesis: BMI: Sg > U.S.
workout .. I suspect that my Sg workout is more than U.S. workout, in terms of calorie burned, and my Sg calorie intake is similar to U.S.

base metabolic rate .. Perhaps the base metabolic rate is lower in Sg.

water weight .. Perhaps my body retains more water in Sg than in U.S.

We don't know the exact calorie numbers. It's possible that in SG the measurable calorie in my diet is similar to U.S., but the energy taken in by the body is higher.

university branding lend credibility to their researhers
Similarly, national academies 

Nobel committee lends credibility to the laureats... most commonly in Econs and bio-medical domains.

major newspapers (and news agencies) lend credibility to their journalists.

-- update bpost on US taxes
Q: is it unlawful, unethical to put incorrect data on tax returns?
IRS is understaffed. Their fraud surveillance system is increasingly automated to reduce labor cost.

The ROI of the audit system has a numerator measured in tax dollars recovered. Therefore, if your taxable income is a small sum, then I doubt they would bother analyzing it. 

Similarly, when I set out to free up my gmail storage, I won't spend time on small disk hogs.

I contributed tax dollars during my 8Y stay, and won't receive any benefit in return. This is "The_system", unfair to H1B immigrants like me.

-- new: burden @carTCO after any burst@carefree-bubble
Private car TOC often takes on a new dimension when you find yourself on a cashflow low ground, or when your carefree-bubble bursts.
* when a family member is in long-term care
* when jobless
* when in bad weather .. emergency repairs costs more
* when we are physically challenged due to eyesight or disability. We might need taxi.
* when we are used to having two cars but then both cars give problems.
* when our driving privilege is suspended

Much better if we live in a well-connected location with public transport.

-- update "buy without oth"
Related to "merchandize return", another major tcost and stressor is keeping track of "stuff bought and disused long ago".

When I lose such an item (perhaps at home or discarded), and have to buy again, I feel an acute self-hate, but this self-hate goes against use-without-care

-- update bpost on U.S. household contingency reserve
As of 2019, the typical Black or Hispanic family has $2,000 or less in liquid savings, the typical White family has more than four times that amount.

-- update: seminar on DS/ML
hiring: DS + finance ... scarce
I think this means hiring team's criteria is too high, perhaps with non-trivial dnlg

Engineering is a huge effort in data science team. I think they need devops, or scripting SWE, rather than C++/java SWE. 
However, java SWE may lack know-how with certain packages.

I think BQuant is a huge investment in DS/ML/AI since 2007.
I think the two BQuant presentations represent the most commercially viable applications of BQuant DS/ML research. Both presentations offer emerging, tantatilizing value propositions. The absence of a more concrete value proposition suggests that AI/ML is still a solution looking for a problem. 

* NLP solution includes a sugar-coating UI to ease the usage of the Bloomberg terminal. The main value-add is an ingestion engine constantly analysing news articles and applying ML models to tag/index/classify content. Users can perform high-level sentiment analysis.

* intraday order-flow data analytics for pre-trade signal .. see https://btv-gz.dreamhosters.com/40285/ai-predicting-security-price-skeptical/

the Bloomberg API is mostly python, perhaps similar to PyTorch and TensorFlow.

~~ i feel these data scientists are not SWE.. seldom uses compiled language. They are users of a software platform.

java and c# are sometimes considered c/c++ applications. (In the same vein, c++ can be considered a C application since it is built on top of C.) I think this description ignores the fact that java / c# developers do need to worry about low-level details.

These data scientists. They use scripting languages and high level libraries. I think they might be similar to app developers using Angular.

They might be similar to quants who write c++ code.

However, a data science codebase can be large and complex, just not in the same way as a traditional compiled project.

However, traditional scientists don't write code. 

Does your skill as a c++/java/c# SWE make you a stronger candidate for a data science dev team, compared to a candidate coming from python, javascript, ruby etc? 
Yes but not much.

I see high churn in this domain.
