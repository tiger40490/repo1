--new: scalability^latency
web2.0 shops don't care about micro latency engineering including multi-threading, language/compiler features. However, web2.0 shops are not always impressed with WallSt scalability. OPRA feed handler requires scalability. Similarly, my NYSE XDP feed handlers can cope with 370 KMPS per thread. 

Many WallSt architects don't care about scalability per se. For other architects, scalability is achieved with hardware and architecture.

Both camps care about data structures, which are fundamental to scalability and latency.

--new: bring tempting foods to office
Nowadays I bring the tempting foods to office.

The worst wrong-* temptation is night time at home. Even when I eat no starch, I still feel a loss-of-control. 

When I eat the same food the next morning or in office, I feel (much) more in-control.

--new: piano practice as a pastime
piano (and other music) skill is not at the same level as gaming, or sight-seeing.

More than singing, Musical skills require absorbency. Like jogging, it strengths self-efficacy, raises self-esteem, 

Musical journey is a struggle, between the level of recreational workout and benchmarked workout. 
There's some form of penalty if you don't put in a miminum amount of practice .. you end up achieving nothing and you waste your effort.
As such it demands a minimum commitment.

If I make very slow progress with a tough piece, I can feel disappointed and frustrated.

I need to select reasonable songs. what if I make very slow progress (stuck) with one song?
How do I motivate myself?

.. sink, buffer, slack resources
Piano practice is an excellent energy sink. If 3H/week, then it becomes a good reserve of slack resource, a buffer of extra time. See blogpost on buffers and alternatives.

--new: CIV: implement hash_table/vector:
eg: Broadway Tech
eg: GS-sg
eg: AshS GrassHopper: no-code
eg: SIG onsite: vector push_back
eg: GS-London: deque: no-code

Why WallSt often ask this? Reveals efficiency in detailed implementation

Why web2.0 seldom ask this? Not much algo involved.
