-- new or update: progressive lens
Let's try 2 cheaper brands, so as to learn the limitations/strengths of various brands. This experience would help me grow as a consumer.

Another goal -- have multiple cheaper alternatives to reduce the stress of safe-keeping.

First pair -- Pantex with color change. $300+ excl frame
2nd pair -- Kodak

Evershine have my data already and may offer a discount.

--update blog on free books
As my collection of free books grows, I may realized there are too many books at home. It proved to be a recurring problem when moving home. Over the years, I have developed my preference for /travel-light/.

Jolt: Those individuals with a large book collection didn't move home as often ! They probably own many books that they seldom read. They were lucky to avoid facing the same reality I faced.

Sugg: proactively give away irrelevant books. This is slightly harder with books I bought.

Another reality with book ownership is -- our reading interests evolve with age.
Sugg: give away some titles that no longer appeal to me, perhaps after browsing through the TOC. 

-- new: scanner features
Grayscale .. between color ad b/w. Bigger files than b/w.
