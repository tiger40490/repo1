--update blogpost on number theory + combinatorics
These math subdomains would remain obscure if programming as (a profession) were not this mainstream, wide spread, lucrative and economically important.

Since the 2000's, more and more IV focus is shifted to math, largely in these two subdomains.

This trend is bad news for the GTD types like Ashish/CSY, the domain experts and the managers like Shuo etc

I think some strong students don't bother with coding skill since it is less quizzed in school.

I suspect that in some colleges, math is regarded as more refined, more classic than coding skill in any language such as python or javascript.
 
--update blogpost on celery
celery pairs well with yogurt and even better with yam paste

--new: j4$7.50 salad
for the 2nd time I bought the $7.50 Novena salad
I would say the home cooking $cost of an equivalent meal is $2-5 but some of the ingredients are unavilable at home.

At home there are almost always some temptation like wrong-time, wrong-food temptations. By paying extra outside, I "buy" freedom from these temptations.

Counseller Bindi asked "What would you tell the 10-year old TanBin?" I would tell him that everyone is weak, so everyone appreciates and often needs freedom from temptations. No one is pure and impeccable in self-restraint.

--new: oil-free grilling, steaming, boiling, microwaving=healthiest cooking methods
Most cooks including my family would not worry about "a few drops" of oil to enhance taste, but it is a slippery slope.

For my longetivity, I want to develop my appetite and taste for
* oil-free "light" cooking
* raw food

Started in 2018, these changes sound impermanent, meerly fashionable, whimsical, and undefensible in the face of practical challenges, but I think these small lifestyle changes go a long way towards wellness including immunity and longetivity.

--update blogpost on stamina/strength
freedom from ill health > healthy longevity > stamina > strong > flexible

"Freedom" includes things like immunity, recovery, and karma. The perspective is shorter-term and slightly more achievable and predictable than longevity.

Note longevity-but-in-poor-health is not really my goal.

Strength is slightly more than muscles strength. Muscle mass is a low priority to me. Those (sportspeple) who gain muscle mass often have a hard time maintaining BMI in old age.

For bone health and some other elements of health, adequate muscle strength is crucial.

Fitness means slightly more than stamina. Stamina means cardio-respiratory endurance (CRE) to me. For me, fitness (and also most strengths) is measured against body weight.

--update blogpost on wrong-time
if i eat a high-calorie, heavy dinner when not really hungry, I can still get really hungry the next morning.

This confirms my observation that calorie-induced ("genuine") hunger is largely driven by timing, instead of calorie balance. Basically, the gap between the early dinner and the morning meal is too long

"wrong time" is such a prevalent problem in SG. It is a problem even at food court, but the $$cost requires me to choose only one meal. The cost makes me slow down and think. (U.S. is even costlier).

With home meal there's no speed bump to help me slow down! So we have to exercise self-constraint which is tough for most of us.

--new jolt: icecream@eastCoast
Q: EastCoast family outing -- in what contexts would I "be there" with family at McDonald's without eating the wrong foods like ice cream?

It's revealing that if I don't go near McDonald's then I won't feel any appetite, but if I spend more than 3 minutes there with family, the (wrong time) temptation would "get me".

A: if I'm more than 95% full then only I would feel no appetite for the ice cream. The level of physical fullness is a very poor predictor of appetite!
A: if I spend only half a minute at McDonald's, without prior planning.

Bao3shan1 -- eating one ice cream is not /destructive/ if I don't continue eating 5 more.

--new: unexpected successes: %%ROTI@boy
Peter Drucker singled out "unexpected successes" as the valuable-yet-neglected category of story, more neglected than unexpected failures. Here are some of the unexpected successes in terms of my ROTI on boy.
NTUC trips
math sheet on his own
macRitchie
jogging in stadium
Superpark
bike trips
basketball "game"

--new: When setting up a new phone (laptop, and outlook are similar), i need to simplify it.
The more I rely on a device (laptop, linux, printer/scanner, camera..) the more I need to (invest time and) analyze my priorities and preferences.

--new (for wife): iphone explosion due to overcharge overnight
Apple Inc hotline told me that there is builtin protection for overheating.

If it's a genuine iphone without damage or tamper, then it won't explode. If it does, it's a defect. What we see on video footage could be fake. 

Before a phone explodes due to overcharge, there would be signs of unusual heating.

--fuxi: body scale
:) I nearly but didn't lose temper
:) no mean achievement to maintain below 64 kg for 5 months

--new: battery consumption after lid-close
for my Acer$299, battery depletion during idle time proved to be a real problem. John Tan (Simlim shop) told me to choose Sleep when lid closes.
I did as told since Dec 2019. It worked reasonably well in terms of battery saving and quick wake-up. The tiny LED blinks red-off-red.. after I close the lid.

One drawback -- sometimes this LED blinks blue-off-blue.. even with the lid closed. I have found that this basically means laptop failed to go to sleep.

Cause? unknown.

--new: leave home for office when losing traction
Coming to office I feel relieved. Office is a /sanctuary/harbor/shelter/ for me when feeling disoriented like "None of the planned actions are appealing."

:) I can workout or stretch here too.
I have much better control of my diet.
freedom from distraction

I could feel the relief as I regain self-control even on the train to office !

What about late night? Let's budget $50/M for taxi fare. We waste money in many many ways. 

--update blogpost on deprivation
Fact: thanks to globalization, food and clothing cost is reducing world wide, so is the minimum cost of living, at least in SG.

Q: but why is our monthly burn rate not reducing?
A: I would say as a bachelor, my burn rate slowly reduced, but as a family, we all want the same level of luxury and creature comfort as our neighbors. 
We would FEEL impoverished and deprived if we can only afford to consume at the same level as 10Y ago (which has now become cheaper)

This question has implications on FIRE and bare-bones ffree.

Wife, as a mainstream consumer, wants to feel "affordable" when considering certain everyday "lifestyle" spend like a toy, personal care, home fixture, fancy food... 
If her friends can afford something, but I tell her "not necessary", she would feel deprived.
To me these "lifestyle" items are all unnecessary, but I'm no purist either .... 

At my abstinence level, projected family burn rate is SGD 2k. 
In contrast, at wife's spending level, she told me 4-5k excluding housing, major medical and travel. 
She wants freedom to spend any way she wants, without asking for approval.

I kind of believe I can be truly *comfortable* at, say, 4k burn rate (excluding housing + major medical + college tuition), but for her, the 'comfortable' level is possibly 8k. The ERE author is much lower.

--update blog on credibility
if the Cambodia developer were a prestigious builder operating in the U.S. or Europe, offering their assets as a REIT, the GRR would be much lower, due to better credibility. 

Credibility translates to higher demand and lower "discount" in the form of GRR.

--new jolt: new c++features=mostly4lib developers
In C++0x, Half of the major new language features are designed for the standard library developers.
The unspoken assumption -- these features are equally useful to other library developers.
The follow-up assumption -- app developers also need to use some (and understand all) of the nitty-gritty details.

In reality, these nitty-gritty details are Not relevant to GTD for app developers.

--new: std::bitset: popular ] WallSt c++coding IV
std::bitset is popular in WallSt c++ coding interviews. Easy to use iFF you are an experienced c++ developer.

to_string() and cvctor from string like "011100101011010"
to_ulong() and cvctor from ulong
operator[] returns a reference, so you can assign to myBitset[0]. Designed to superfically mimic a raw array. Actually, return type is not reference to a bool. Rather, I think it's a reference to a specific posiiton in the "backing store". See http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/bitset/bitset/operator[]/

Avoid the notion of "left/right" when using bitset. Prefer "higher/lower" instead. Lowest bit has position 0, becasue bitset is designed to represent a binary integer. Therefore, to scan from highest bit, we must iterate from bitset[size()-1] to bitset[0].

--new: price discovery and closing auction
When an order is sent directly to NYSE, NYSE could follow an algorithm and route it to BATS-Y which fills it. I guess the fill report should probably show 30=BATY

liquidity indicator might show 3 (routed out)

An exchange provides the (nearly) ideal venue for price discovery, but in reality the fragmentation of liquidity (eg: routing-out) makes price discovery non-trivial even on a large exchange like NYSE.

Luckily, the closing auction remains a centralized process. Even though a stock symbol can be traded on multiple exchanges beside the primary listing exchange, auction orders are always sent to the primary listing exchange.
