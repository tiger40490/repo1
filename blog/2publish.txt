-- update blogpost on 12M delay
eg: An RTS suport manager, a white American, told me a sizeable percentage Americans choose to earn a degree in their 30's. (My NUS class age profile is not too different, with up to 10% in the late 20's.)
This route is similar to the very common "returning" Master's student who have worked for a few years to gain some firsthand experience of the working world. 
In my MSFM, about 30% of the students were experienced.
I think these "older" students often come in with higher motivation, rather than forced to study as my son is now. 

Not every student is suitable for a nonstop flight secondary->preU->undergrad->Master's 

If I lose this nice job then US relocation would be the default route. If boy does poorly in secondary school he would not attend poly or JC but serve NS first. If he finds motivation before 16, then we can choose to migrate or complete JC.
