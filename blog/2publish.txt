-- new Subway^MRT: fiscal dicipline
In the subway system, we can see evidence of the fiscal discipline and cost efficiency of U.S. vs SG.
Adjusted for ridership, I guess the budget is no higher in SG, but the quality is much better in terms of frequency, cleanliness, probability of delays, customer service,,,

Without enough data, I can only hypothesize that SG system is more judicious with public spending.

U.S. corporations and individuals pay much higher taxes, but governments run deficits every year. Therefore, public debt increases every year to cover the deficit.

Let's look beyond the subway system. Most Americans, rich or poor, get a much worse deal in terms of public service per tax dollar paid. Therefore, top American employers spend a lot to provide the "public" service that's wanted but missing. In other words, private employers step in to cover the gap between  public services and what employees need.

Looking into the numbers, another reason for the excellent service/tax ratio in Singapore is the non-tax income to the SG government. That includes profit from government-linked companies, and sovereign funds. 

I guess a less discussed reason is rEstate appreciation, which is stronger in SG. I guess that land sale revenue (to government) has grown over the decades. Also, many local rEstate assets are owned by government-linked companies, and these assets appreciate much faster than in the U.S.

-- new ##a reminder rarely picked up
eg: I put my interdental floss on my desk as a constant reminder. I use it once a few months, but it is still worth it.
eg: I put my grip trainer on my desk as a constant reminder. I use it once a few months, but it is still worth it.
eg: I installed my pull-up bar at home years ago. For years I didn't use it but it was a constant reminder. Now I use it every week
eg: I installed my punchbag at home. Now I use it once a few months, but it's a huge reminder.
eg: company provides standing desk to everyone. Sometimes I use it once a week, but the gap between usage can grow to a few months. Yet it's still worthwhile.
eg: we bought dozens of books from China and positioned them in "prime" locations. Kids pick up one book in a year. Perhaps not worth it

-- update BMI in SG
Why BMI challenge is so tough in SG vs U.S... could be 1)home cooking or 2)homeostatic hunger in the SG climate
With equivalent amount of intake, in the U.S. I tend to feel less hungry.

-- new: delay breakfast^reward early rise
If i didn't really get up early, then perhaps no need to reward

-- update bpost on ICON
* lipido .. Doctor said a urologist could prescribe medication but I don't feel a need for it.
* wine to help sleep. Red wine in moderation has health benefits (will try it more). All wines are better (more natural) than sleeping pills but it's not ideal to depend on substances for sleep. Occassional use of wine for sleep is OK.
* yellowish .. Doctor noticed improvement over 11 months. Face is less affected than palm and sole. Doctor has done all the test needed to assess health risks associated with yellowish skin.

I heard a departing colleague's truthful reflections including the reasons for the departure. One of the reasons is related to comp benchmark. I guess (with good level of confidence) that he feels that given his value-add and effort, he should receive $XX more (whatever XX is).

The more one dwells on it, the more one would feel unfair -- Someone else in the same team has the same level of value-add but was rewarded much more.

It's a valuable protection that I don't put in extra effort and sacrifice for the manager. It protects me from the hazard of harmful comparision. If you don't compare, you feel satisfied. If you do, your bubble bursts and derails.

At my age, I don't salary-benchmark as much as in my 30s -- I don't care so much about wasting my potential, my spare capacity. It's good and bad. 

It's bad if I am chronically underpaid (20% below market) like J.Zhang.
It's good if my employer and my manager is generous and keen to retain older SWEs like me.

-- LG2 new: when we size up someone: socioeconomic
First impression is like judging a book by its cover. In this bpost i'm looking at socioeconomic strata. Let's limit to 3 elements: 

physical wellness [posture, skin, dental] .. 5% ~~> 25% of my assessment
educated and sophisticated vocab/articulation/manners .. continues to be 45%
ethnicity/nationality/accent .. 50% ~~> 30%, esp. relevant when sizing up caucasians
.. citizenship is usually unknown. Here I am talking about implied nationality.

Dress .. is not a factor in itself but often a subtle hint of education, income, and socioeconomic strata.
