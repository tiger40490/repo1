she recommends joint mgmt with psychologist.
No hurry though.

holiday feast .. soup first;  minimize starch otherwise; limit cakes to 6 pieces/meal (assuming regular size).
I was reluctant to set target, but now I like the idea.

fasting .. I described to her milk + fruits for entire day. If below 400cal/24H, then safe to practice twice a week. My fasting is 600cal+, so no safety concern.

After age 60, can aim for BMI=25, and maintain muscle mass.
Current BMI 21.x is very good for my age.

Going back to 63 kg .. probably not something to aim at.

Why I was able to achieve 65.5 kg .. awareness; conscious self-control.
