Most people are only familiar with capital gains investing - buying something at a low price, selling it at a higher price, and pocketing the difference. In other words they are focused on trying to get rich. When you focus on investing for cash flow, you are focused on building your wealth, creating passive income that earns you money without depleting or selling the original asset. 

--new: my chosen retirement country may improve
jolt: I never think of the possibility that my chosen country of retirement could improve rather than decline

Q: Which country might outperform from a retiree's point of view, including healthcare, air/water, domestic helper cost, mobility aids, ...
A: I feel SG is the favorite. China may improve.

--new: (jolt) retire in familiar countries
I think many Australians feel Singapore is inferior as a retirement destination. I think they are rational. 

We don't have unlimited number of years to try out various locations so we end up retiring in the 3 or 4 places we know, even though another destination may actually be a better choice.

In defence of this common practice, Perhaps it's not completely naive and irrational. Perhaps what's familiar and comfortable makes the best retirement destination.

Q: can we really retire in a rural place in China or Malaysia?
I tend to feel positive

--new: ##reasonable, non-essential, addictive foods
For these foods, most of us mere mortals find the wrong-quantity temptation challenging, so I would say "Stay as far away from these foods as possible". 

However, it could be harsh and unrewarding to stay away for too long. I endorse periodic abstinence. I practiec it on ice cream. 

rice
nuts
century eggs
bread with nuts or other plant produce, but without cream
? creamy cakes? not reasonable, usually bad for health
? ice cream
? hummus? Not so addictive

--new: whole fruits beat juice 
fruit juice is more convenient than whole fruits but is inferior because
* many bad ingredients are hidden. 
* juice go bad as fast as half-eaten fruits
* less fiber, less filling
* many fruit flavored drinks are nothing but a regular sugary drink with a bit of fruit flavor additive. Nothing to do with juice at all.

--new: bad substance: degree of harm
when it comes to calorie counting, One of the least noticed math features is
various degrees of "bad" when we decide to loosen up and eat bad food

I feel creamy cakes are among the worst, but for most people, it is probably impractical to completely avoid creamy foods as if they were opium. Various degree of bad -- fried peanut and alcohol are both worse than creamy.. tobacco is worse than alcohol and drugs are worse than tobacco. 

In the mass media, we can see the different attitudes towards different categories of "bad" subtances.

More stupid are the calorie-dense foods that aren't satisfying -- fried peanuts; alcohol; mint ice-cream; cheese chunks; 

--new: buying small packets of nuts
Nuts are OK but not essential 

Slowly get into the habit of eating/buying small packet of nuts. This is based on an honest assessment of my limited self-restraint

--update blogpost
In SG, family meals present the wrong-time and wrong-quantity temptations. Living alone in Singapore, I face only the wrong-food temptation and I have better control.

--new: score each delicious
For each highly attractive food (creamy cakes, flavored nuts,,,) I will record up to 3 scores. (No more than 4 different scores as I would tend to forget.)
* published calorie density vs my own estimate thereof, on my own digestive system, in my own body
* the food's value as a taste-enhancer to encourage me to take in more raw veg.

Case study -- nuts are the prime example of this type -- high published density but lower density in my estimate, and high value as a companion for raw veg. For better enhancer score, I should take only garlic flavored nuts without coating.

Case study -- left-over starch in a delicious starchy food. For example, Red-bean bun or pizza ,,,
I often use these foods to help me take in more raw veg. 
After I eat up the most tasty part, there's the left-over, usually starchy. I always feel a semi-conscious urge to finish the left-over but .. but the satisfaction+reward vs calorie "load" profile simply don't make sense!
 
.. les simportant scores:
* harms and benefits. Few foods have known side effects -- tobacco, trans-fat, alcohol, 

Before I blacklist a highly attractive food, I better decide really how bad it is.

--new: increase tolerance for raw veg #deeper-green
The higher my tolerance for raw veg, without any taste-enhancer, the better my chance of long-term health. 
The higher my tolerance for home yoga practice without any help, the better my chance of long-term health

higher tolerance = deeper-green zone.

Caution -- if i can tolerate the extreme form of diet and celebrate it too explicitly, then I develop a negative perception of the less extreme yet worthwhile diets like fruits

Eg: raw celery and carrot without any dressing
Eg: Sat morning yoga on hard surface .. is extreme, and when I decide to go realYoga studio I felt like a weakling
Eg: no movie for a year .. is extreme. When I decide to use movie as a reward I hear a nagging zsms
