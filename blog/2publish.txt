Household size can be 1 or more.

-- LG2 update which one? bpost on speed coding or NBA?
Street dance ^ eGaming ^ speed coding
Street dance skill can't make money for you.
Singing is similar.
Piano is similar but .... can teach... There's a good demand.

basketball talent .. Top 0.1% can make money

Speed coding is very different. Many companies are interested to hire you.

--update wise consumer
Y avoid branded colleges
If a branded top-quality middle school costs $20k/Y over 2Y, then many would be able to afford it, but could the brand give the parents esteem for decades?

A branded college does make the parents proud for decades, and makes the graduate stand out in over-crowded dating markets, but look at the price tag. If the 70k/Y price tag is clearly /affordable/ to you, then you won't need to be a "wise consumer". For most families, however, 300k over 4Y is too high, so these families need to assess the benefit/cost.

Those with insider info often realize the benefit is not so high.

-- update... https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/10950/bmi-flexible-cre-strength/?
After the meet-up with YY.T, I realized fitness is not a priority to me.

Longevity
freedom from illness
intimacy
good sleep and appetite
BMI .. seems to be a key indicator/predictor of many of the above.


-- update which bpost on inflation? https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/1551/2022era-of-peak-cpi-inflation/ ?
in Aug 2022, UK energy bill per household was projected to hit SGD 500/M, representing 11% of the median disposable income per household.

My reaction when I read it? Not much. I imagined my own total bill (curently SGD 200) rising to SGD 500, and I told myself we would simply cut consumption. Realistically how low can we cut to? Perhaps down to $400. That's still huge inflation but not a big hit on my family burn rate.... compared to big tickets like MSFM, Mindchamps, maid, IRAS

That's one straw on the camel's back, not the last straw.

-- slowcooking upate resilience
Americans, Mainland Chinese... receive less support from the state. "You are on your own." they were told. Such a message is rarely given to SG citizens. Sg citizens are often reliant on the nanny state. I guess this is similar to other small nations like Finland, Norway, Luxemburg,,, 

The reliance is evident in many diverse domains.

However, Singaporeans as a whole is a fairly resilient nation, as shown in numerous crises [covid, SARS, 1997AFC...]. We are resilient in spite or because of our reliance on each other. 

Same can be said of a family. Kids rely on parents. Siblings lean on each other. 

I guess a small school, a small company are also like small nations -- tight-knit group. 

There are individuals who don't need to rely on others. They appear to be resilient in the lone wolf sense, but I don't know how common they are, or how strong they actually are. 
I guess in most cases, resilient people tap on a "support network" rather than act as lone wolves. 

One of the most intimate illustrations is counselling, like sexual issues, phobias, obsessions, addictions, behavior issues. Optimism (in the Lone-wolf sense) is just a word, often a weak and ineffective word by itself. Positive thinking is .. ditto. In half the non-trivial cases, the individual needs guidance and a helping hand. Dependency yes, but that's real resilience for real people.

~toilet blue flush
I used to think this is unnecessary lifestyle creep. Now I think it can 
* reduce water consuption because wife (and I) will not "flush again" when the blue conceals the light-yellow. Half flush never worked with my wife.
* reduce conflict with my wife

-- slowcooking new: career insecurity: 2017 watershed #marathon
t_vague
2017 marked a watershed in my perception of career insecurity.
Before the watershed, I had a "learned insecurity", instilled in me due to decades of brainwash, and internalized.

tech churn .. defeating any attempt of accumulation
The widespread and entrenched notion that "Few can remain hands-on till 40."
threat from younger or stronger competitors.
DRam refresh .. and maintain your critical mass
strengthen your moat, maintain your lead 
Don't drop out from the leading pack.
slow income growth outpaced by long-term (CPIx) inflation not only in home prices.

I felt like a (less successful version of) EDB -- can't afford to slow down, because of the constant risk of getting outrun/outmaneuvered, or caught up... The risk of losing our relevance.

After the watershed, I could see the end of my IN-voluntary marathon. Now am planning my own light marathon driven by successZ. 
This marathon could take me all the way to 70s. 
I hope to enjoy it.
Therefore, for the remainder of the marathon I could afford to slow down to a stroll, drop out of the leading pakc, and let other people overtake me, as happend in Toa Payoh stadium jogging track.

I told SY.C that my 100k/Y dev-till70 is not passive acceptance and failureZ, because I still make an effort -- a light maratho is still a marathon.
