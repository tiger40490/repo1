No shared_ptr

--new: mkt data sys avoids shared_ptr/STL
t_xRef
shared_ptr and STL containers, java autoboxing ... are avoided in mkt data due to extra DAM allocations on the fly.
shared_ptr in terms of the ref counter
If a vector is reserved and never reallocates, then it incurs no on-the-fly allocation

--new STL is fast but heap-hot
STL is faster compared to
* alternative designs using virtual functions
* alternative designs not using compile-time TMP techniques

However, STL containers are slower than those without on-the-fly allocation
