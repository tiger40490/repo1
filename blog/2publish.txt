-- new: prediabetic
Hba1c is slightly more accurate than FPG. For future blood tests, include both.

Q: some sites classify 5.6% as prediatetic? 
A: 5.5% vs 5.6% is insignificant difference in Hba1c. Nutritional adjustment should be enough to restore 5.5%
A: If really worried, then reduce sugar and carbs as a long-term lifestyle improvement.
%%A: I think fruits are a 3rd item to worry about

Hba1c is slower to change and shows less fluctuation. Hui Mei said usually the FPG will detect pre-diabetic even when hba1c is still normal.

As we age, diabetic risk increases, so it's better to adjust diet habits in younger years.

-- update bpost on 'resotre'
My recent depression is about coping (and making peace) with aging. 

My aging is kind of gathering pace, and I think it will accelerate. Gradually I will lose physical and some mental capacities. 
I will adjust to it, even though adjustment can be stressful, painful, frustrating,,,

-- new: Hui Mei consultation#2
she recommends joint mgmt with psychologist.
No hurry though.

holiday feast .. soup first;  minimize starch otherwise; limit cakes to 6 pieces/meal (assuming regular size).
I was reluctant to set target, but now I like the idea.

fasting .. I described to her milk + fruits for entire day. If below 400cal/24H, then safe to practice twice a week. My fasting is 600cal+, so no safety concern.

After age 60, can aim for BMI=25, and maintain muscle mass.
Current BMI 21.x is very good for my age.

Going back to 63 kg .. probably not something to aim at.

Why I was able to achieve 65.5 kg .. awareness; conscious self-control.

-- new commonLaw^civilLaw systems
Judges have more flexibility and power in commonLaw systems. U.S. judges can pass unusual judgement (trespass case).

In fact, commonLaw judges have power to make laws. These "precedents" are often as important as written statues ... a feature of the commonLaw system.

Lawyers play a more central role in commonLaw (than Civil) systems. U.S. and HK movies often feature dramatic court room events.

CivilLaw systems originated in continental Europe; CommonLaw systems originated in Britain. As a consequence,
HK continues to follow a CommonLaw（普通法） system but China is a largely CivilLaw jurisdiction. Macau follows a CivilLaw (大陆法) system (Portugal).

Consistency and predictability -- Some say CivilLaw has this advantage, and other say CommonLaw has this advantage.

-- update or new: threading in c++ less popular than in java
Concurrency dev is difficult, in both design and the basic building blocks as language constructs. Java makes it easier, much easier than pthreads and std::thread. It is so easy that java interviews routinely include some concurrency questions.

Factor: the c++ shops I try are all trading shops. They choose c++ for latency. To optimize latency, STM is best, rather than multi-threading. So I think their c++ threading questions are light.

-- new: GPT
application domains of GPT:

language translation 
designing visuals, 
making animations, 
researching complex topics

How slow is the training? As of 2023, hundreds of billions of Words would take months using supercomputers. Fine-tuing often takes days on smaller computers.

It's too expensive to host a LLM instance within your company firewall

Fine-tuning means ... writing instruction/goodOutput and feeding them.

GPT models generate text in casual, humorous, professional,,,, styles.

Educators can use GPT-based software to generate learning materials such as quizzes and tutorials. Similarly, they can use GPT models to evaluate the answers.

-- update [18]proof-of-work ] blockchain
Proof@Stake
Q: what if a big "shareholder" of a ABC coin mishandles a validation, and adds a bad block to the ABC blockchain? 

Does she earn the "gas" before or after the bad data is uncovered?  If "after", then bad data is included in the ABC block chain for at least some time, and during that period, unlimited number of subsequent blocks could go into the blockchain, leading to a mess. So I will assume answer is "before". 

So technically, how can the "second validation" take place in real time? If it is straightforward to detect a bad block, then the first validator would always do it automatically, and there would be no risk of losing your stake. In such a case, every participant would stake 100% of their coins each time. That means the biggest "shareholder" would keep getting richer, and richer.

I believe it's not straightforward to detect a bad block produced by the first validator. That leads to a can of worms.

Suppose there's a dispute... someone disputes a past transaction on the blockchain. Who has authority to question the first validator? Who would be the judge? I think real power ultimately lies with the founders and the software developers. This is not decentralized concensus-building.

-- new or update: detect stuck thread in a pool
weblogic marks a pooled thread as stuck if it is busy for 10min (configurable). Weblogic is designed for a large patient queue, so each patient should not take 10min.
Purpose of detection is not per-patient intervention. Purpose is hospital mgmt such as thread pool config, memory increase, or load balancing.

For a custom application, this doesn't work. A thread can be busy and productive for any amount of time.

-- new or update on signal+socket
signals in windows? not popular

real time signals are a new Posix concept... not really low-latency. 
Low latency sockets don't rely on signals for immediate action

Many signals are self-sent from the same process. I think timer alarm is one example. Sockets signal is another example. However, keyboard signals like Ctrl-C are not self-sent.

Signal is designed to be asynch, seldom immediate, though the scheduler may preempt whatever is running and give the next time slice to the signal's target process sooner than normal.

One of the most common signals is SIGSEGV. The default signal handler function performs a core dump. There's no process to preempt. However, the current process may not check its signal table until some instructions later, and then run the signal handler.
