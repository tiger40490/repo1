-- new: Dr Wee [gastro specialist] said
Liver cancer always comes with (verifiable) liver symptoms. If tests show no symptom, then basically no chance of liver cancer.

Regular ultrasound enough for annual screening. AFP could remain elevated. Rising AFP could be a cause of concern.

Sleep deprivation (not late sleep per se) can increase dementia risk, but not liver or other organs

I asked moderna vs Sinovac. Sinovac less effective -- antibody level is lower. better use Pfizer booster.

.. fatty liver
Always due to diet+workout
Many people have fatty livers but clean blood test -- not to worry.

Need to get knowledgeable and get used to fatty liver.

Why is fitness class easier than self-practice?
Self-practice requires constant SMS, constant motivating (like dRam refresh), constant push beyond the comfort zone. Lots of system2 work.
For example, after a rest we need System 2 to decide when to restart, set a target and keep count.
In a class, we can relax System2 and follow the instructor and other students. System 1 is efficient.

Remember the Bayonne yoga class led by the Russian student? I didn't like her instruction but still I followed.

If it's a video, then I would not be able to "just follow it"

biggest time-consuming procedures that require focus focus

#1 ice .. sugg make ice in office and bring home
.. worry: spill while putting in .. sugg: use tight boxes
.. worry: melt too fast if outside
.. worry: some ice chunks get stuck and wasted .. sugg: ignore them, and refill the box.
.. worry: ice melting in blender if left too long .. sugg: leave ice in blender and wait only without liquid.
.. sugg: use smaller ice bags. Can fit into the other drawers.
#2 carving out avocado
.. worry: wasting.. Sugg discard more of the avocado
.. worry: contamination

-- new: unnecessary urgency
My current GTD speed would be frowned upon in Stirt, GS or Barcap.

As Alan Shi pointed out, most of the effort actually went to waste in those ibank tech departments.

Mvea, RTS, OC teams .. are somewhat better. MLP is generally more relaxed.

--new time won't stand still
The last weekend of Oct 2021, I put in many hours 
* to add visualization
* to add more tests

Why? What's the motivation, j4 and ROTI? I asked the same question about MSFM, C#, Swing, quant self-study, python... I still don't have a good analytical framework. 

Key observation -- time won't stand still. It keeps flowing at a constant rate. Time can't be warehoused. If I don't spend my time on this coding practice, I would easily "waste" it on one of the energy sinks.

This coding drill has multiple benefits in hindsight
* the visualization emboldened me to engage Deepak, Daryl, Josh Lim, even my son. The "engagement" further enhances my "learning" .. various aspects
* my visualization is now barely usable for the "engagement", but if it is unusable, then my effort would still be a worthwhile effort. It reminds me of my pre-sales effort, my self-employment days... 
* I had a blogpost about  weekends otherwise wasted: G3 ROI@UChicago. Even if the code doesn't work, this is still zqbx. Without this zqbx, my ezlife feels decadent, wasteful and an incomplete success. 

My friends' effort and my own effort were not in vein. It restored my self-confidence as a c++ developer. The self-confidence is priceless.

-- new: CIV hands-down win/loss: unbalanced reactions
today I helped Sachin on Q2 of a python CIV by a crypto shop, where he and another Mr Mysterious couldn't pass all tests. I immediately dismissed my success as my luck rather than skill.

In reality, the test criteria is completely fair and clearly documented, so my code is actually better and and my coding skill (by definition) stronger.

My quick automatic self-dismissal, self-devaluation, self-brush-aside is blatant and completely unbalanced:

* when I win hands-down (about 30% of the head-to-head contests) I always dismiss it.
* when I lose hands-down (about 30% of the head-to-head contests) I label myself with many labels -- poisonous labels.

Perhaps the other team (Alina and her friend) doesn't understand the question. Perhaps the other team didn't design correct. It was not an easy careless mistake since they looked very hard for an explanation.

NoSql is bigData, not DS/ML. 

Data Science probably favors python or R. ML is even less suitable for java.
ML includes classification, recommendation, ,, NeuralNetwork is part of ML

-- new: 2022 review: techBets, TSN
Most of my past techBets and tsn ... are likely to pay lower dividends after first 10Y. 
Strategic orgro is a holy grail.
I will receive the dividend when I change job  back to .. bondMath, mkt data, sockets, SQL or Perl, 

We all have to be discretionary, cautious in our positioning.
I spend lots of time blgg about this.
Despite the underwhelming results of my techBets and tsn, we must not give up.
Applicable to Singapore government too. 
We need to decide what tech to take up and what to put off.

For the last 15Y, finDev IV is my chose game.
The 3 types of dnlg are still relevant.

After 55, we should leave cpf oa balance as is. It grows at 2.5%pa, better than bank deposits in liquidity or return.

any time after 55, I can incrementally withdraw most of my cpfOA ... to invest or spend.
