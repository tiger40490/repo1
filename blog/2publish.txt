payout will start at 65. I wish to receive higher payout, to strengthen livelihood security. That requires me to top up to ERS at 55, 65 or somewhere in between.

If I hit ERS at 55, then liquidity suffers! I lose some 250k liquidity for 10Y! I may need that money for college, property etc...

Q: can both of us hit ERS? Possible but unlikely because it would require SGD 1000k cash.
Q: so who has priority to hit ERS? Me since my payout starts early, but she would feel more secure if payout is under her name.

-- new: sustainable long-term return{annities
I have bought four annuities. Additionally, cpfLife is a "descending annuity"

Q: what's a sustainable (annualized) return before expensens?
%%A: 4 ppa

Note this return rate is very different from (usually higher) the more visible payout_rate.

HsbcLWA seems to feature 8~9 ppa. I think it's unsustainable.

-- new: reality of temp jobs 4me+youth
I tend to perceive temp jobs positively, as learning.

many unlucky job seekers end up working on temp jobs. No job security, low pay, limited trec
eg: Chinese immigrants to Canada
eg: Shuo in 1997 after graduation
eg: my temp jobs in 2005
eg: many of the jobless 2023 graduates from China universities

If you don't worry about livelihood, then you can enroll in a training program instead.

-- update bpost about sanctuary... or addicted...
During the smashing episodes, I relied on office as a sleeping place. More importantly, during that crisis, I came to office 7 days a week and shifted focus to a demanding task at work. A healthy shift.

Some office tasks are too demanding, too stressful, but I have found other office tasks quite manageable, and a wholesome, welcome diversion.

Beside the "tasks", the physical environment of the office is a sanctuary, a harbor for me.

I hate tiresome commutes including multi-transfer commute. Red and Green lines are integrated with quick transfers.

most serious breach known to me is IP leak
Electronic leak is the most common. Printout of IP is tracked, and we are not supposed to bring them out of the door.

Copying commercial software license to home .. is a breach, but may not be so serious.

GP doctor prescription ... requires SGH pharmacy visits (2-3H round trip). Each prescription should say 100mg. Needs my contact number.

-- update bpost on bone/muscles
My bubble has yet to derail or puncture.
Now, among the non-overweight, there is a high probability of muscle loss. I am good so far.
By now, I have largely avoided the "magnetic field" of overweight. My enviable BMI can come at disproportionate cost
* Older adults often need to fight, on their back heels, an uphill battle to retain muscles. Losing muscle can reduce your BMI but it also affects your metabolism rate
* amputation can reduce your BMI, but do you want that?

-- update bpost on long-term SG inflation
K.Hu suggested roaming retirement to Malaysia. Singapore is susceptible to imported inflation but not Malaysia.
Switzerland citizens don't have a next-door neighbor as a low-cost retirement destination. (Spain?) Sgp has JB.

Some x% annual inflation over some 15Y translate to perhaps 50% commulative inflation in Sgp. Malaysia cost level is much lower and will address that level of commulative inflation.

SGX blue chip stocks are an inflation hedge. 

STI ETF? has expRatio, inferior to single names

SP500 ETF is a classic inflation hedge.

A similar experience to share -- Mixed vegetable-rice (杂菜饭) is my default choice when I eat alone. In June 2024 I went to a low-cost street venue (without Aircon), and bought a regular 杂菜饭 -- two-veg-one-meat for $5.50. Used to cost $3.50 ~$4, perhaps 10 years ago. 

For a historical comparison I need to hold every variable constant:
* location .. food court (with Aircon) is my current default. Frequently, I do choose cheaper place like this June venue
* portion .. one-meat-one-veg-on-rice (一菜一肉) is my default. Frequently, I do get 1 or 2 additional items like this June case

$2 was my cost level some (20) years ago. Now the same food costs $3.50 minimum. When I see a price display of $6 for 杂菜饭, I get a sinking feeling (心里一沉) and immediately urge myself to cut down to two-veg-on-rice. Less often, I would tell myself I'm not really hungry and can wait until I reach office or home, where low-cost healthy foods await.

Q: how much would the same food cost (in the same place) in 2035? Probably below $7. My optimism.

My son may start working full time in 5 years, without a degree, and make $3k/M. $6 a meal translates to about $15/day. With that salary he has to cut down on food cost.

Even though food is an essential expense, food inflation is my least worry because ... many (reasonably healthy) choices exist. In contrast, I care more about medical, housing+utilities, public transport.

If 15GB insufficient for wife, we can buy additional "data pack" for one month.

Once you buy, it auto-renews monthly. That's the official (bad) answer. Such a "deal" is inferior to a bigger monthly plan. However, in reality, monthly data packs are better due to flexibility. You can cancel auto-renewal after one month.
