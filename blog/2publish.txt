-- new: parenting: minimum weekly dedicated hours 
I would say a lot of the parenting hours can be non-dedicated such as but not limited to multi-tasking.

Quality time is not all dedicted hours. Dedicted hours are not all quality time.

Q: what's the minimum amount of dedicated parenting time, given mother's dedication?
A: zero, as long as my kids are not in need of me.

Imagine a parent with 15 (including adopted) children. I think he can be an effective parent.

Some parents work 6 or 7 days a week, over long commute. They can be effective parents.

Personal experience: I had been working away for many years. 

Not spending a lot of dedicated hours with kids is not unacceptable. In fact face time is dangerous.

-- new: wind-down tcost: to be embraced
Opening eg: In Bayonne, after every yoga+pull-up workout, I would spend about 2 hours shopping to wind down. It's a kind of reward, so that the prospect of the next session is not so off-putting. 

The wind-down is a necessary tcost, due to human nature. I don't think there's any superhuman, not in my dad, in Wenqiang, in Rahul. 

In a way, this wind-down is comparable to sleep. Sleep is not a waste of precious time. Sleep is a positive element our human life. 

The wind-down is a replenishment/recharge/recuperation and should be seen in a positive light.

If the wind-down is enjoyable, then be grateful.

.. speed coding exercise .. is very taxing, depleting my reserve. 
.. QQ learning is more enjoyable than speed coding exercise and require less wind-down.
.. my son's green zone.. 

--update the blogpost on HF
t_fomo^livelihood
To HF, do I come across as fully satisfied, without pains, except parenting?

1) PIP, bonus, stigma, respect
2) FOLB, exclub peer comparison
3) boy's "performance"

In terms of livelihood, All my top 3 deep, recurring pains above are "superficial" i.e. not real threats to my family livelihood, largely thanks to my interview skills. But IV is the flagship of a fleet of strengths. I should also give credit to
* the dev (not just tech) job market and my decision to stick to it. I have key talents to thrive in it such as low cultural bias
* the WallSt contract market that I discovered and held on to
* lifelong wellness habits
* bedrock of stable marraige. I made the right choice.
* bedrock of SG citizenship providing essential protections. I made the right choice.
* my lifelong earn/save/invest and Fuller wealth strengths

My descriptions above tends to lean towards external locus of control, but in reality my personal factors are more important.

--new: paying^self-learn^procrastination
For python camp, WP hosting, yoga and piano, I tend to compare paying vs self-teach

Why don't I compare paying vs procrastination? This is the more realistic picture of choices. I need to get real and accept the imprefect self.

I think paying may give me the boost I need in self-confidence.

--new jolt: jeju green-tea chocolate
2019 summer my family was one of thousands of turists at a famous chocolate "museum" on jeju island.

The building, the decor was exquisite. Perhaps so was the chocolate but I only had the leftover bit from my daughter's portion.

There were long queues to buy a chocolate ball for about USD 5.

At such horrible $cost + tcost + ccost, you get a real savory experience, right? Well, not in my case. Greentea always ranks as one of my least favorate chocolate flavors, even though this particular rendition was probably a bit more appealing. 

So I didn't join the queue. 

I guess my kids really enjoyed joining the queue for something supposed to be exciting... They don't know what they really enjoy. 

How about buying a high-floor apartment? High $cost and also access tcost but I don't get anything meaningful.
How about buying a quiet suburb home without public transport connectivity?
