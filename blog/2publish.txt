== new Everything that matters is a competition@@
t_jolt
In my mid-20s my dad noticed that I saw everything as competition.

Q: For each item below, is the endeavor/struggle/// personal or is it fundamentally competitive? Specifically, is it realistic to define success without benchmarking with competitors? 

-- For wellness .. I would say non_competitive. Mostly a personal endeavor.
-- burn rate and cashflow mgmt .. I would say non_competitive. 
Some people spend $20k/M but they are doing fine due to high income.
I spend $3k/M and feel good, but how do I compare those supersavers who spend $700/M? I think both can be doing fine.
-- For personal investments ... non_competitive. 
Even if my portfolio is lower return, higher risk, it is fine. If the risk is too high, then it becomes a problem but not really due to peer comparison.

In contrast, if you run a fund then you must compete for mindshare.
-- for family livelihood .. fundamentally non_competitive. For most people salary doesn't depend on competition.
jolt: I'm in the minority to perceive salary as fundamentally determined by competitive job interviews. 
-- hobbies .. non-competitive by definition, including so-called competitive hobbies. The hobby is a success because it helps the individual grow, express the self, reach out to a community, regardless of competitive position achieved.
-- parenting .. fundamentally non_competitive. 
However (jolt), exam-oriented parenting can be competitive to some extent like "want to make my kids perform better than those families". 

Some parents even set a target to send their kids to some top school. In such a case, success depends on benchmarking.

I feel I have grown wiser, stronger, mellowing up. I now care less about exams and top schools.
-- family harmony, unity .. non_competitive
-- job interview .. competitive at least in the high-end tech interviews, because these are elite teams. 

QH.Dong said something like "GTD criteria is too low. Probably 80% of candidates can clear that bar. We need to find someone stronger than existing team members in at least one area, to complement the our mix."

The more senior, the more you hear "seeking the strongest candidate that our budget can attract."

If you only target a salary below the national median, then recruiter probably has a hard time filling the vacancies with qualified people .. non_competitive

-- dating: fundamentally competitive. You could be a fine person, but (more often than the other way!) in the dating market you may appear less attractive, less humorous, less resource-rich, less "suitable" as a life partner. Mate selection is fundamentally "picking the best mate that I could grab".

jolt: I have carefully omitted personality match -- the notion that what I want (in a mate) differs from what my volleyball teammate wants. Well, I choose to focus on the fundamental and universal desires. At the fundamental level, we both desire the same type of mate. Therefore, competitive.

Some people say they simply want to find someone "barely good enough" i.e. without major personality mismatches. I think this attitude is more common in arranged marriages, because the arranger can't give you 200 choices.

After the initial dating, how about the effort to maintain the love relationship? non_competitive

-- important exams .. fundamentally competitive, as the top schools target cream of the crop. Some students are not competitive. Some study like serious hobbies.

In UChicago, many examiners use bell-curve. In NUS, First-Class honors is bell-curve based.

However, if result is either P or F, without a grade (like driving tests), then exams are non_competitive. You are up against the examiner's standard, not other peer benchmark. 
The minimum requirement to pass is non_competitive. We often see the entire batch complete a program.

-- academic research and publishing .. non_competitive. However, there's a minimum standard in this _profession_. In some influential journals or conferences, you would need to produce outstanding findings to be accepted. Consider contributors to the Christian magazine [[parenting teens]]. Clearly a serious hobby. Yet to be accepted, your content has to be non-trivial, professionally-written. 

In contrast, teaching profession is non_competitive.

If you publish only on a blog, or you self-finance a print publication, then it's like a serious hobby.

-- new: solitude, sight-seeing
Schopenhauer : "The capacity to be alone is one of the most distinctive marks of a high intellectual being."

Many depend on other people[including service providers] to keep them /entaintained/ and engaged. 
I used to envy those ex-classmates, ex-colleagues who travel widely for sight-seeing. 
Now I think they resemble my bored-stricken kids -- they are to various extent dependent on the new experiences to keep them (stimulated) feeling alive. 
More than half the intellectuals I admire are not so dependent.
My father is the best-understood example. He enjoys sight-seeing but is completely fine with the (pandemic) travel restrictions.

writing, painting, sculpture, music-making, reading, some singing (in my experience) .. is solitary. My long emails are semi-solitary. Social media apps are not. They require another person to respond in real time.

retirement .. solitude is valuable. Physical self-reliance is probably the foundation of solitude. 

Nomadland is an introspective journey about solitude.

Many Buddhists advocate detachment, self-reliance and the impermanence of close relationships. Stay Connected in bad times like covid19? Sure but watch out for overreliance.

-- new: good looks=often overrated #livelihood
In terms of livelihood, Good looks are not as "valuable" or life-enhancing as, say, technical skill, communication skills [empathy, leadership..], wellness, 

Even physical talents are more valuable because good looks don't help you become a trainer. 

Good looks (esp. for young women) offer an unbeatable advantage during the dating years. (A beautiful girl really needs to maximize her advantage and find a reliable husband. ) After the dating years, good looks lose value quickly. You can find value in it only by restarting the dating game.

Many say that good looks can help you make it to the modelling/acting profession, but I think it is overrated. Good looks are very common.

Contrary to popular belief, good-looking women, and esp. men, do not have a net advanage in sales, for most products. Sometimes your good looks help you attract attention, but once the propective buyer pays you the attention, he or she may be distracted by it when you try to explain your product.

Online commercials .. often feature good-looking _and_ knowledgeable trainers. They do enjoy an eye-ball advantage. First time a viewers is distracted by the good looks, but not the second time. 

pre-school teaching .. good-looking female teachers have an advantage as kids are drawn to them.

People with good looks but not other skills tend to display an air of inferiority.

Canada is an attractive emigration destination due to healthcare. However, the Singapore integrated shield basically provides a comparable healthcare. 

-- new: alcohol
t_ska
Alcohol is much more than nutrition or health. 
Alcohol is social. We are judged. Your alcohol attitude is comparable to your attire or your transportation choices. As a more remote analog, golf is much more than a sport. As such alcohol is highly commercial.
Therefore there's a lot of sponsored research in the health effects of alcohol. These findings tend to dominate the discussions about alcohol.

There's too much misinformation and propaganda about alcohol. I have little bandwidth for that noise. Instead, I prefer simple, verified facts about alcohol:
* In human history, alcohol hae never been necessary for health or happiness. The health benefits have not become substantial.
* alcohol presents many risks not only to health

alcohol lifestyle might be important for some salemen but not me. Many of those OC-effective types tend to "advise" me to embrace alcohol. I used to feel weak and ineffective in my stubborn, "old-fashioned" attitude on alcohol. Well, now I like my attitude.

--update sunshine
Q: In which area do you give much-needed sunshine but your peers don't bother to?

The question asks me to name where I give sufficient sunshine, so it's impossible to surprise myself, but I will still try to name unsung heros.

driving experience review
adequate sleep
exp recon
tax-like expenses
tech Dram refresh
career longevity + healthy longevity
flexibility
current income? Not really "much-needed"

-- update blogpost on college ranking https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/2020/09/21/university-rankings-hkindia/
Many familiar college names have an informal reputation among a small circle of my friends, sometimes just one guy.
The published ranking often challenges those informal and vague, often biased impressions. One concrete example is Princeton. A close friend wrote that "Princeton 本科是第一（USNews)，进入非常困难." I replied 

QS ranking -- https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/princeton-university is latest ranking, showing Princeton at #20
THE ranking -- https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/princeton-university shows Princeton  at #9
Good to recognize that not everyone thinks Princeton is the #1 best college. 

-- new: UChicago drop-out risk 
When I started at UChicago, what's the probability of drop-out like Shou.Liu, Henry.Yang and Chris.Ma? More than 30%

So the long journey demanded a lot of effort, commitment, perseverance ..

I needed a reason to continue. In hindsight, the branding is now fairly valuable in terms of self-image.

--new: G9 SMS to break away from mainstream brainwash

* My wife always feels I look too thin for my health and appearance. I remind myself "I trust my BMI analysis -- Based on years of self-monitoring, My BMI goal is well-founded. Many in my cohort would probably get better healthy longevity if they adopt similar BIM goals."

Most of the other SMS messages are related to middle-class aspirations

* Many of my peers seem to suggest my family deserves higher BR. I focus on livelihood and believe a BR equal to 80% of local median income is reasonable and adequate. By that standard, many of my peers spend way too much. 
* branded college .. Can I accept if my kids only get into community college or polytechnic? This mainstream brainwash is still hitting me hard 
* home size
* car ownership .. In the U.S., and even in SG, my peers take up car ownership for convenience, not livelihood. 
* career longevity is more important than salary; healthy longevity is more important than financial security

--new: waste of water/energy/$ in the family
I always feel guilty about wasting water, energy or (more frequently) hard-earned money.

I still waste some, every now and then, but I don't give up and accept my wasteful acts. 99% of the people around me (mostly Chinse) don't care as much as I do. I often feel most folks simply don't care about "small" wastes. 

My family members seem to do the same. That's the reality I need to accept.

I still want to improve my own habits + my family members' habits in this regard, but I always overestimate my ability to change them. I'm stubborn in my refusal to accept that "reality". 

This is possibly at the root of endless commmunication failures. The cost is rather high in terms of harmony, family bond, and happy marriage.

ML.Jiang once told me about some classmates. A Chinese national and a Korean national living in Singapore as a couple, who spoke Japanese at home.

I was impressed.

Immediately I assumed that they speak mostly Japanese between them and their Japanese fluency is equal to their mother tongue.

Well, DaShan the Canadian in China is one in probably 1000 foreigners who speak such fluent Chinese. So to a Japanese national, both of them probably sound non-Japanese.

The less you know someone, the more you assume... Remember HY.Cai
