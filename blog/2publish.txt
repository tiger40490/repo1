-- new: Chinese/Korean couple: bad assumptions
ML.Jiang once told me about some classmates. A Chinese national and a Korean national living in Singapore as a couple, who spoke Japanese at home.

I was impressed.

Immediately I assumed that they speak mostly Japanese between them and their Japanese fluency is equal to their mother tongue.

Well, DaShan the Canadian in China is one in probably 1000 foreigners who speak such fluent Chinese. So to a Japanese national, both of them probably sound non-Japanese.

The less you know someone, the more you assume... Remember HY.Cai
