--new: a G3 valuable gift to my kids
One of the least mentioned but most valuable resources I can give my kids is my live presence due to my healthy longevity.

Even at age 80 I can be a role model for them, sharing my wisdom, otherwise my lessons learnt.

I can be in charge of my assets and train them to manage for me.

Look at grandpa or grandma. Their presence has a net-positive effect, because they are not yet dependent and burdensome.

--new: wellness can be overrated
jolt
I and my friends often say net worth is overrated and wellness is undervalued.

Look at fitness instructors and discharged soldiers. Also some of the professional athletes but they are rare. They are often very fit. Some (not all) of them are more healthy than the general population.

However, many of them struggle to make a living. A minority of them become successful businesspeople. The rest and the majority of them are average in terms of income and life chances.

In my rather biased view, the most common "problem" with these physically fit people is brbr anad cash flow low ground. 

* if Bob among them is able to make a good living, then his fitness is a great asset in his life.
* if Alice among them is able to keep her burn rate very low, and hit brbr above 2, then her fitness is a great asset.

Now, most of my friends don't have that background. Some have incomes a few times above national average. Some of us are still trapped on cashflow low ground, perhaps due to brbr, high leverage, ambitious/aggressive investment. Personal wellness is now a huge differentiator. The relative importance of wellness is best seen in this  context.

--new: your hunger could be completely different from mine
For decades, i seldom felt hungry in the morning.

Some told me to try and feel the hunger, create the appetite

Some said breakfast would help delay the hunger at lunch time. Completely wrong prediction in my case. Breakfast always intensifies, not decreases appetite at lunch time.

Some said a decent lunch would suppress hunger in the afternoon. Completely wrong in my case. The obvious fact in my case is, even if eat a resonable lunch at 2pm, by 5 I would experience real urge to eat

-- new: long trough in stocks,gold,,
t_gold
Xp: unit trusts - about 3 out of 10 get stuck for 5Y+
Xp: Majestic Village

On the basis of the blogpost on big-ticket necessity outlays till 55, here's a follow-up question:
Q: if the amount of money is not-neded (i.e. I don't have a need for the amount sunk in), then Why did I hate long trough in a liquid asset like stocks and gold?

This quesiton underlies my subconscious resistance to long-term commitments such as endowments. 

A: more disposable income (for better commute, enrichment programs), more current income, brbr buffer, exclub(?), windfall profit(?). I hate to have my money locked up while giving up these "nicer" things

Reminder -- most of the time the "not-needed" condition is not 100% satisfied i.e. I do have something of a "need" for the amount. This reminder is very relevant for gold, and also (not for long-trough) HDB upgrade.

--new: white elephants: gold^mansions
gold
As discussed in ... most top school district homes have underwhelming rental yield, because you can't subdivide them into smaller private units. These homes are so expensive partly due to psf premium in a premium location, but a bigger reason is size. They are white elephants due to taxes, maintenance costs etc. In contrast, commercial and prime-location residential properties are both prestigious and high-yield.

Grand piano is another white elephant. I always prefer simple, functional alternatives.

Jewelry is a white elephant. Poor liquidity, low inheritance value, but Gold is a less white elephant. A kilobar sounds prestigious but you have to pay some security firm to hold it for you.  One advantage of gold coin collection (not kilobar) is that you can buy or sell a small portion of it. Fairly liquid except the lousy bid/ask spread.

--some notes from the informal mid-year review
* flexibility while testing with global brokers
* learn more varieties of EPA's, esp. on the dnlg
* higher productivity, faster delivery
* be more vocal during team meetings, but it's easy to put someone else on the spot
* PMA bug fix 

--new: what2give my kids: the Most valuable 
My healthy long life and my presence throughout their adult lives? This is what I value most in my dad.

Lifelong habits? I think this is overvalued. Lifelong habits are not easily transferred across generations. It demands effort on my part and on their part.

Education beyond certificates? I think this is overvalued. Education is 70% achieved by themselves and perhaps 20% by parenting and 10% environmental.

financial inheritance? Very tangible benefit. This benefit is very much enhanced if thanks to longevity I am available to "administer" it.

-- update: next HDB home: 
buy first (am picky on the buy)
This will save us the trouble of moving twice.

Possibility of renting out some extra rooms.
