-- new: UChicago^NUS benchmark performane
20 years after graduating, one thing I remember about my NUS performance (relative to other schools) was the 2nd-class honors. I think a big factor is the final year project, or perhaps having two D's automatically disqualifies me from first-class honors.

There's no point analyzing it, since we have no inside knowledge.

In contrast, my UChicago grades are much better -- mostly A's and one or two B's

Therefore, I fared better in math than engineering.

-- fuxi or update on recreational
my analysis of a stock often hits dismal ROTI because I only buy up to $100.

Tolerable for recreation

Over 2020 I invested about 2k

why I have two healthy kids? Largely due to the Effective mother

--update blogpost on becoming lifestyle
Most people accept that they would 1) want to stop working sometime in their 60's 2) not be accepted by employers at that age, unless they are doctors or professors.

Therefore, they don't work to build career longevity. Most likely they won't achieve career longevity. Their lifestyle is part of the reason. 

I don't accept that lifestyle.

David's answer -- refusal to talk to parents
Grandpa's answer -- running away from home

My answer is -- effort. If he puts in effort but ends up with those results, I feel I would love him unconditionally. I recall XR's autistic son.

Teresa Teng was not a strong math student but worked hard at every subject.

Currently, despite his piano practice, his poor effort everyday is eroding the loving relationship. Unconditional love is under threat. Boy is very sensitive and can probably sense it.

Grandma notices the tension between two forces inside me. She drew this analogy -- imagine your sponse is diagnoised with cancer. You experience the huge pressure to take on the huge legwork and decide on treatment options for the spouse. At the same time, you may also feel the tendency to reject the cancer, and blame the cancer, but the cancel won't go away. Grandma said the 2nd, negative emotion is counterproductive. Yet it is real and common. 
I feel this is a good analogy. The cancer may be incurable. You still have a job to fight it and slow down its progression.

Remember Biden's love for his son, despite his drug problem. I would say he is still a successful father. Indeed a father would be successful if he did his best to stop the progression of such an addiction.

In the same blogpost, there's also a gay son's story. Is that an "effort" problem?

I'm no perfect child. If I have a son like me, is there something I can't accept? Theft!

My son has no aggression, no cruelty, no dishonesty,,,, that's why I find his laziness unacceptable.

-- new: socially awkward 
BillGates and Mark Z were described as socially awkward in school.

I was very awkward in primary and secondary schools. Slowly found my confidence in high school.

Humor (and wit) is something I lack in most teams. In Shiyan I had a bit of wit, but not humor.

Watching the Mr.Bean episode "Exam", I recall that most western men strike me as comtemporary and polished. But I beat most of them in studies (bigO), in self-discipline, in wellness, in brbr/FullerWealth, even in analytical writing.
