Using Nobel prizes as a university ranking criteria has multiple problems.

Problem: peace prize is not as relevant as, say, a Chemistry prize, but it's unfair to leave it out completely.
Problem: many academic domains have no Nobel prize, while physics/chemistry/bioscience enjoy the limelight. 
Problem: what if a Nobel laureate is actively courted to work in various universities to boost their ranking? Should the methodology exclude any tenure of a laureate after the award?
Problem: should exclude short-term stays as students or staff .. how short?

https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/facts/lists/affiliations.php has an authoratitive list, showing the universities Nobel Laureates were affiliated with at the time of the Nobel Prize announcement. Peace and Literature should be excluded, but sometimes not

38 Harvard
24 Stanford
23 MIT
21 Berkeley
20 UChicago <-- the only powerhouse in the midwest
20 CalTech
18 Cambridge
18 Columbia
17 Princeton
13 Rockefeller University !!
11 Oxford
9 Yale

Over the years, the relative importance (name recognition of laureates) has changed across the 6 prizes, so Econs/Peace and Med laureates get more lime light than Phy/Che, which remain largely unpopular to mass media and social media.
-- update bpost on college ranking
Reputation ranking based on surveys tend to suffer from alumni bias. A large university (population-wise) would have a larger number of ex-employees, visiting staff, alumni, and their parents. When they are included in the surveys, they tend to give the unversity inflated scores.

QS is more about reputation, but they miss the key point that "Within a big country reputation is usually benchmarked nationally, seldom internationally."

For an international student choosing a college across the world, QS meets the requirement, comparing the reputations at a global level.

For a domestic student looking across her own country (India, China, Japan or U.S.), the local ranking by national agencies are overriding. The national ranking may put BB well above AA (whereas international rankings put AA above BB), and the domestic student would usually ignore international ranking.

I believe that international students (and their parents) mostly choose high quality universities, so percentageOfInternationalStudents serves as a yardstick of quality.

Shanghai ranking is more stable than QS or THE.

slowdown of decline is the real goal. Steve also felt similarly.

improvemenet is rarely a valid goal. Positive feedback is rare.
One type of visible improvement is "endurance" in a tough pose.

Steve spoke some truths that other instructors couldn't
* sugg: hold longer, like yin yoga, and rest in the pose.
* sugg: need to relax much, much more. If you are tense, then the muscle can't stretchÂ 

The pain in the affected body part ... is part of the process. It would improve over time. Should not be uncomfortable at the whole-person level meaning you must be able to relax with the pain. It's possible.

I guess there's a harmony between the pain and the relaxation.

I heard a departing colleague's truthful reflections including the reasons for the departure. One of the reasons is related to comp benchmark. I guess (with good level of confidence) that he feels that given his value-add and effort, he should receive $XX more (whatever XX is).

The more one dwells on it, the more one would feel unfair -- Someone else in the same team has the same level of value-add but was rewarded much more.

It's a valuable protection that I don't put in extra effort and sacrifice for the manager. It protects me from the hazard of harmful comparision. If you don't compare, you feel satisfied. If you do, your bubble bursts and derails.

At my age, I don't salary-benchmark as much as in my 30s -- I don't care so much about wasting my potential, my spare capacity. It's good and bad. 

It's bad if I am chronically underpaid (20% below market) like J.Zhang.
It's good if my employer and my manager is generous and keen to retain older SWEs like me.

I now feel slightly less guilty about my growing dependency on AC.

(Is there anything NOK to switch on/off frequently? No evidence.)

Dependency on AC is very common, so commercial support is widespread.
Dependency on car is ditto, but the commercial support is pricier.

Dependency on wireless connectivity is very common, but you depend on other people most of the time.
Dependency on wpress is uncommon
Dependency on NY/NJ subway is common during peak hours only. Extra dependency on it is uncommon.

-- new: horse riding
I don't know why many (usually white) Americans enjoy horse training and riding.
Statistically, it's very dangerous. Whenever you fall, there's a real probability of injury.

How does it compare to motorbike or car driving? 

I sometimes envy their enjoyment, but that enjoyment is not so important to me
, whereas the risks are.

How about keeping a dog? I think there's a real advantage -- my kids would be more confident about dogs. Dogs are quite common in the U.S.

How is yoga in comparison? Is yoga that important? I guess it motivates me to keep working on flexibility. In that way it is life-enhancing.
