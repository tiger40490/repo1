--new: 12M-delay(!!repeat)in SG school 
if we need to quit US and return to SG, we don't need to see it as losing a million dollars. We can consider an international school, or get boy to join a JC as an older student. Remember HJC classmate Zhong Xiong.

Some China students join a U.S. school as an older student so they don't get bullied, and more mature against bad influences.

I too was delayed for 1.5 years but excelled in HJC. I accepted it very grudgingly. My parents were unashamed, unapologetic.

I also had many NUS classmates a few years older than the majority.

..consider IB school for boy
earmark 30k/Y tuition

Once he leaves the public school system, he can't come back!

bring boy to visit some of them? He may prefer an IB school to a public school !

If I lose my MLP job, I have 3M of compensation but I would need to immediately start the U.S. relocation. Boy would have little choice but move to U.S.
