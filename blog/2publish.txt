The focus on the word "protection" is likely to uncover some threats I perceive consciously or subconsciouly.
[c] SG citizenship -- protects against healthcare inflation, long-term nursing co, housing cost, general inflation. Some protective benfits of SG citizenship are not measured by money -- 
* protection against poor service (common in many countries) when I'm in need of help
* protective environment for up-bringing of kids -- drug-free,,
* SG government has a large past reserve to protect Singapore against many threats.
[c] good burn rate as family -- protects against many cashflow threats. 
[c] bx plans
sound education for kids -- protects against parents' worries
[w] good sleep -- protects against workload, ,,,
[w] good diet
[w] bmi greenzone
stable marriage -- is a cornerstone and protects against many threats
harmony at home
[j] WallSt contract job market -- protects against early decline of demand
[j] IV competitiveness including theoretical skills
[j] English skill -- protects against job market competition from overseas newcomers 

[j=threat of job loss or job pain]
[c=cashflow stress or distress]
[w=welness protections]

--new: income eq-funds: my take
I feel most of the big fund houses probably avoid the high-yield, high-risk stocks such as U.S. REITs.

I guess for them, 4% div is considered high. I assume the fund dividend payout comes strictly from stock dividend, not position liquidation. Therefore, a typical “high-income” equity fund can only pay 5% average. In reality it could swing between 3% and 7%

--update blogpost on canada: 
The names of many U.S. cities conjure up romatic images in my head, but to visit or retire there, main factor is 1) cost and 2) climate, 3) Chinese community

Therefore, I should consider Penang, Jiande only

--new: ice-cream: buy expensive popsicles
Some ice cream popsicles are tiny and expensive. 
When we buy this product (rather than the big tub), we are "persuaded" to eat less ice-cream each time, and more slowly. Without the popsicle packaging, I would probably eat 5 times in one sitting.

--new: BMI L@ctrl: self-care^self-hate
a big part of my cabin fever is diet loss@control, esp. the wrong-time temptation.

I'm used to be in control, so the loss of control is devastating, degenerative and destructive.

self-hate, unreasonable expectation are part of the underlying.

What we need is compassion and self-care. In my preoccuation with BMI, I fail to recognize and celebrate the huge effort and success in
* avoid family meal when not hungry
* starch
* fat
* raw veg + fruits
* chia seeds

Pehraps my diet is not lost, but BMI battle is in decline. If that's the case then we need the bao3shan1 strategy.

Perhaps the increased calorie intake (presumably due to starch and fat) is directly due to coping with stress

Perhaps what I need is intermittent fasting or warrior diet. Go without starch/fat for 16H everyday.

--new: live free of restrictions
I can live with the restrictions of diet, burn rate... but not LiuShuo style self-restraint in office context.

I feel the suffering is not worthwhile.

I don't feel self-confident I can "improve" myself.
