If I'm a CAD patient in Japan, I may worry about my country's quality of medical care. I would worry that Japan doctors are not fluent enough in English...

The pattern -- whichever group I find myself in, I tend to worry about its calibre and quality.

Since 2010s I have had a consistent assessment that pff is my strongest hand, strongest tectonic plate, and my "best-performing" game, in terms of personal efficacy, battery, accumulation,,,

Money can be kept in a bank and preserved, like batteries. (Few other things can.) Inflation is the enemy.
Money is one thing I can pass to my kids. If I stay healthy, I can provide stewardship of a multi-gen reserve.

Luckily for me, there are non-financial "legacies" in which I have confidence. I spent lots of time with my kids and influence them.

Q: r-ikigai?

-- new Sys1^Sys2
These two terms are increasingly widespread and therefore prone to oversimplication, just like the "EQ" concept.

sys1 and sys2 are both susceptible to biases and mistakes.
sys1 follows habits and past experiences, often subconsciously
sys1 is more emotional and less logical than sys2
sys1 is largely unconscious; sys2 is always conscious

HK English standard falling against other Asia cities
How can it beat Shanghai, Taipei or KL?

With the exodus of non-Chinese expats, more people tend to use Chinse more.

In the 90s/2000s, some Singapore writer hypothesized that the largest concentration of effectively-bilingual popoulation might be found in Hongkong. At that time, I think HK Chinese standard beat Sgp, but not in English.

Many people ask me how the UChicago MSFM is not really a distant learning program.

We had a Singapore campus where projects and tutorials take place and where staff maintain offices.
Singapore campus had conference rooms, library, project rooms.
Exams were conducted strictly in an exam venue on campus.
All lectures have live video link between Chicago and Sgp
About 1/3 of the lectures were conducted locally and live-streamed to Chicago campus

-- new: cooked food inflation
After I returned from Japan, I visited food courts a few times. Cooked foods like 杂菜饭 in those places are getting expensive. Perhaps 10 or 15 years ago, I used to buy the same cooked foods regularly.

For everyone who needs to buy cooked food every day, this is bad news. However, on the flip side, this visible inflation bring out something good -- It suddenly mad me appreciate home cooking .. cleaner, better ingredients, more nutritious, often 更好味道. For the same quality, $10 to $20 would be the price in those low-cost outlets. Fancy restaurants would sell even higher, for pretty much the same food.

Why did the Japan trip matter? Because in Japan I reminded myself to avoid all Chinese food. As soon as I was back in Singapore, I wanted to try Chinese food again. I went to a few places and checked out many Chinese foods. Then I came to notice the widespread inflation in cooked food.

-- udpate "fast developers"
Q: can you imagine a fast doctor (perhaps travelling with soldiers) who treats lots of wounds but has a 1% error rate? If some of the errors are severe then he is disqualified and unreliable.

Q: can you imagine a restaurant chef very fast with his work, but once a while, produces a dish with salt omitted, causing complaints? (Note sometimes salt can be added later.) If too frequent, then she is disqualified.

In SWE profession, if there's a well-known error-prone coder, we often say that we constantly worry about him producing buggy code, so much so that we would rather not have him coding. The threshold of "too many missteps" depends on frequency and severity. 

A key factor is personal reputation. 

I tend to write more documentation than fellow SWE. The act of writing and rewriting detailed docs enhances my awareness of (personal) blindspots, hidden areas, edge cases. Those docs that are written for a wider audience would receive more attention from me the author.

Across a /structured/ codebase, I tend to bend over backward to enforce consistency. Inconsistency is breeding ground for bugs, so this habit can flush out some bugs.

A smaller habit is naming variables, functions and classes. I spend lots of time naming them precisely and consistently. That forces me to slow down and pay attention to some details in the logic.

All of these personal habits above slow me down, but they tend to protect my personal reputation and reduce those embarrassing or disastrous/devastating bugs.

-- update bpost on longevity https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=48298&action=edit
In Dec 2023 I started to worry about quality_of_life in my mom's twilight years, either in a Beijing nursing home, or a Singapore nursing home, or living with my wife (while I'm away in the U.S.), against the backdrop of her declining health.

quality_of_life is another side of VV (one of the trio).

All the scenarios appear pathetic, unappealing, scary,,, As people grow old, they are bound to experience (some or all of) mobility decline, mental decline, living away from immediate family, or outside their own comfortable n familiar home. Inevitable for many in their 80s. 

Given an elderly's health, financial and family situation, his choices are often limited. If money is not the problem (willing suspension of disbelief), then perhaps he can live with family + adequate healthcare at home [R.Teo's dad?]. Hopefully (big hope), the in-law caregivers are able to cope, supported by plenty of external resources. This "acceptable" bar is too high to be realistic.

Before I can plan ahead, I have to give up on unrealistic expectations.

How about my ADL insurance? I now feel somewhat more vindicated. 

The more children and grandchildren I have, the more resources I have available in my old age.

-- new slow-cooking: growing richer but not happier
"Compared to the post-war era or pre-modernization era, we are substantially richer but no happier."

This is a dominant [widely shared] observation in many countries, at both a societal and a personal level.

In contrast to satisfaction and fulfillment, "happy" is a short-term self-assessment/rating. Re hbA1c vs FPG.

I think most people won't bother to focus or reflect on everyday forgetable happiness, including those doses of delight. We need to focus our mental energy on the problems to solve. Therefore, we tend to remember our adversities [sufferings, difficulties, frustrations, setbacks, declines]. The longer we live, the more difficulties we encounter. Our happiness self-rating would tend to decline. Therefore, improving longevity tends to affect happiness rating.

Basic-healthy nutrition .. our increasing wealth makes BHN easily achievable, but in only x% of the population would BHN bring happiness. 

inflation .. (rent, medical, transport, fashion, entertainment,,,) creates long-term worry in any age group. I think in previous eras, the average people don't save so much, and don't live so long

sleep easy .. physical wealth seldom gives the individual better sleep, but granted, wealth can bring you a quiet home and flexible work hours.

tech churn in personal tech .. I think many (esp. older) adults don't want to keep learning, adjusting to new tech. Many feel forced to do so. The GUI is often designed for and tested with younger users.

isolation due to digital communication.. digital comm is a big part of economic growth, but it doesn't make me happier.

Obligation to save for retirement... is a decade-long thankless job and constant sacrifice. 
This obligation, sacrifice, stewardship, due diligence, risk-management,,, affecs our simple happiness. We are forced to stay on our toes. 
People in poor living conditions don't need to save that much for retirement, and their retirement years are shorter.

Involuntary delay to retirement .. often due to poor retirement plann

More years spent taking care of sick parents.. Watching their decline somehow makes me feel less happy For Them.. pessimism.

How about mom and dad after selling the home? I think they would indeed get a better quality of life in the luxury retirement home. Grandma would become happier .. I choose to be optimistic for both of them.
