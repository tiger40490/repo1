--new: self-care in the face of parenting challenges
category: anxiety
the conflict with my son draining my energy. 
self care: I think exercise + lean diet would also help build my self-confidence

I can talk to grandpa or counsellors but more important (for parenting but not for self-care) is wife discussion. 
self care: Also more important than the discussions is blog review and git-blogging.

Sometimes work project can provide work stress, or positive stress, depending on my concentration.
I feel lucky to have short commute + the office as my sancturary.

eg of cognitive self-care: Many neighbors' kids are less academic than ah-boy, some are more academic. I don't compare with them, not excessively. 
Where I do get mad is when I see my son's laziness or poor organization. However, if his benchmark result is close to the top (perhaps in a U.S. school) then I might say he is just like CSY's son.

--update blogpost: after all 3000 shares finish settlement, I will look at the full deduction $DD and transfer $DD from 153, and record in this blogpost.
Upon liquidation, if the actual incoming amount (net of fees) is $II, then i will transfer $II to wife.

The prices don't matter as much as the actual $DD and $II. All fees are charged to SRS and borne by wife.

--new: smashing"safe"objects = slippery slope
I have damaged a toy monkey.
I have smashed a red-bean bakery.
I have damanged iPhone8 screen.

It's important to remember the collateral damages, or they could be sacrificed for nothing.

Some people don't care about the damages and therefore tend to forget them. I have an advantage that I do care about them.

--new edu resource uneven distribution
We know that educational resources are never evenly distributed. Everyone wants to get into the better schools. 
(Actually, I feel the most important education resource is the extended family. )
Singapore's resource "allocation" is more merit-based whereas other countries often have more wealth-based allocation. 

When you think of the wealth-based, you confront the exclub-wealth. Actually we are relatively OK in terms of exclub-wealth, but we would need to cut spending on other things such as overseas trips.

Luckily, I have prepared myself for years to deal with and hopefully overcome the waves of cultural shocks related to top schools, stratification, stigma, branding.

In either merit-based or wealth-based systems, you are always performance-ranked, as I said years ago. If you are a musician you may want to ignore the ranking and focus on your music. 

I happen to have a UChicago and NUS under my belt.

--new: scalability^latency
web2.0 shops don't care about micro latency engineering including multi-threading, language/compiler features. However, web2.0 shops are not always impressed with WallSt scalability. OPRA feed handler requires scalability. Similarly, my NYSE XDP feed handlers can cope with 370 KMPS per thread. These systems are operated by a dotcom!

Many WallSt architects don't care about scalability per se. For other architects, scalability is achieved with hardware and architecture.

Both camps care about data structures, which are fundamental to scalability and latency.

--new: bring tempting foods to office
Nowadays I bring the tempting foods to office.

The worst wrong-* temptation is night time at home. Even when I eat no starch, I still feel a loss-of-control. 

When I eat the same food the next morning or in office, I feel (much) more in-control.

--new: piano practice as a pastime
piano (and other music) skill is not at the same level as gaming, or sight-seeing.

More than singing, Musical skills require absorbency. Like jogging, it strengths self-efficacy, raises self-esteem, 

Musical journey is a struggle, between the level of recreational workout and benchmarked workout. 
There's some form of penalty if you don't put in a miminum amount of practice .. you end up achieving nothing and you waste your effort.
As such it demands a minimum commitment.

If I make very slow progress with a tough piece, I can feel disappointed and frustrated.

I need to select reasonable songs. what if I make very slow progress (stuck) with one song?
How do I motivate myself?

.. sink, buffer, slack resources
Piano practice is an excellent energy sink. If 3H/week, then it becomes a good reserve of slack resource, a buffer of extra time. See blogpost on buffers and alternatives.

--new: CIV implement hash_table/vector
eg: Broadway Tech
eg: GS-sg
eg: AshS GrassHopper .. (shallow implement) interviewer didn't come to the coding stage.
eg: SIG onsite: vector push_back
eg: GS-London: deque: no-code

WallSt interviewers have a broader tradition of onsite implmentation of other standard components
eg: auto_ptr in eSpeed
eg: shared_ptr
eg: lockfree stack

I think many fellow candidates in my circle would fail at these question which are designed to reveal detailed understanding of the nitty-gritty. If I consider myself 50% shallow, then those guys are ... 10% shallow?

Why is WallSt obsessed with it? It reveals efficiency in detailed implementation

Why web2.0 seldom ask this? Not much algo involved.
