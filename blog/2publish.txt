eg: An RTS suport manager (white American) told me many Americans choose to earn a degree in their 30's. 
This route is similar to the very common "returning" Master's student who have worked for a few years to gain some firsthand experience of the working world. 
I think these "older" students often come in with motivation, rather than forced to study as my son is now. 
Not every student is suitable for a nonstop flight secondary->preU->undergrad->Master's
