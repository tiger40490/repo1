There are many variations of "common practices" in c++ but in java/c# the best practice is no-choice. 
No-choice is a Very Good Thing, as proven in practice.

These dynamic languages rely on a single big hammer and make everything look like a nail.

This is another example of "too many variations" in c++.

--new (jolt): dental appearance^obesity: affluence
in the past, dental appearance of a local population is an indication of socio-economic wellbeing (and affluence). The developed countries all feature cleaner teeth.

Also, skin diseases are often left untreated in developing countries since they are not life-threatening. Therefore, skin health is a sign of socio-economic wellbeing.

Nowadays, the protruding belly is now the leading sign.. They indicate poor education, poor government effort, low quality nutrition such as convenient junk foods (like pizza) ... 

Note Low cost nutrition can be high quality.

--new: 2019 Deevali weekend

burn: diet : effective control over the temptation 
brought boy out to reservior
burn: got up early on all 3 days, esp. Sunday
learned the essentials of google drive
burn: email to Ashish ... analyzing the anagramIndexOf problem.
burn: refreshed some tough coding problems esp. the insights.

--new: 18 Oct half-day leave + following weekend to help boy. 
Is it worthwhile?
Valuable facetime with teacher, followed by a few phone calls with grandpa

My ROTI accounting needs to be much more inclusive (beyond muscle-building) before we could say this weekend roti was poor
* yoga
* jogging with a few minutes of yoga. Those few minutes is a tough challenge on any day of my adult life. No mean achievement. 加分不够 ! 
* boy swimming
* help Ashish
* coding drill
* a rare 30 min of c++ GTD+zbs. Note in the past even 30 seconds of xx was hard when working with boy.
* an hour + in office on work project. Even 10 min spent on the project is a challenging proposition. Get real. 加分不够 !

Based on my hypothesis, imagination and a tidbit of observation.

Majority of the effective, efficient, productive tech professionals don't work long hours because they already earn enough. Some of them can retire if they want to.

Some percentage of them quit a big company or a high position, sometimes to join a startup. One of the reasons -- already earned enough. See my notes on envy^ffree

Most of them value work-life balance. Half of them put this value not on lips but on legs.

Many of them still choose to work hard because they love what they do, or want to achieve more, not because no-choice. See my notes on envy^ffree

--new: the allure of late night quiet time #living with family 
See also the blogpost on early rise

Q: what's the best use of early rise hours?
A: stay home (no distraction) .. can talk to wife. 

I often feel extremely lucky to get a quiet time after kids go to bed. It felt .. precious. But perhaps I can cut yoga, stadium

This quiet time is often inferior to other quiet times

* early rise quiet time is free of kids distraction. I can also talk to wife if I choose to.
* morning commute offers quiet time if I get to use git blogging
* In office I get plenty of quiet time .. early morning, after work, and during lunch break

I feel it's much better to sleep early and get up early. For now we can ignore the health benefits and focus on quiet time.

Consider taking mild sleeping pills to help me regulate. Consult a doctor
