rerun() to remotely echo or cat into in.VTA, then tail the adapter log. Really minor automation, but let's see how reliable it is

--new blogpost: eat: less is more
calorie restriction means reduce starch, fried or creamy food. Most of the delicious foods are successfully reduced to my tolerable limit, without depriving myself.

Less is more. More health, more vitality, more confidence, more self-esteem, more control on my diet, 

However, the self-esteem should NOT be based on false beliefs and brainwash/propaganda.

--new: too much SGD or USD?
After we relocate to U.S. we will have some SGD reserve, growing thanks to HDB rental income. What use do we have for this growing pile of SGD? 
* perhaps as wife's reserve. I think she prefers SGD
* perhaps to top up CPF 
* Perhaps to hedge against USD devaluation. 
* Perhaps convert to USD to invest in US or Asia.
* put my surplus SGD into CPF-life at age 55.

Until the relocation, I think my USD would be in surplus. 
However, any property big buy is likely in USD, but unlikely in SG

When USD is on the rise, I have a chance to gain "access" to it by converting to SGD. Worst case it goes up further and never comes down

----new: 3deeper mtv2work4more$ after basic ffree
* a suitable job for Phase B. A light-duty, semi-retirement job providing plenty of free time (mostly for self-learning, blogging). This goal is indeed a $-motivation because with more financial resources, I can afford to take desirable Phase B jobs at lower pay. In fact, I did pursue this route in my 2019 SG job search.
* more days with grandparents -- need more unpaid leaves or work in BJ home
* more respect, from colleagues or myself

--Below are some motivations not so deep
* better home location (not size) -- clean streets; shorter commute; reasonable school.. Eg Bayonne, JC

-- Below are some 2ndary items
* more time with kids? Outside top 5 motivations.
* better (healthy) food? usually I can find cheaper alternatives 
* workout classes? Usually not expensive
