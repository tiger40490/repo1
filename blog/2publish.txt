--new: fellow parents spending massive time with kids
the media suggests that many parents (mostly mothers) of pre-teens spend half their weekends taking kids to places hoping to expose them to in-situ learning. 

In q3SG phase, I was silly enough to follow these suggestions. I forgot I'm a different parent with my own priorities and limitations. One of the key differences -- 
My spare time is so precious to me. Many of These parents have lots of spare time that they spend on e-entertainments (gaming, internet surfing, online chatting) dining out, socializing. I'm completely different. 

The t-cost of weekend TO me is 5 times higher than the cost TO them. 

Another key difference -- their effort possibly paid off more than in my son.

--new jolt: time spent blogg`about boy=therapeutic
Time spend blogging about boy is therapeutic. 

Also, the time spent preparing his math worksheet is therapeutic -- a landed punch; am able to focus, calm down and make (albeit slow) progress; gaining traction rather than wheel-spinning

I'm good at these even though they take up huge amount of energy and precious quiet time.
Luckily I don't feel worn out by these efforts.

I feel at my age, parenting IS a main job, comparable to my day job. 
Actually, Career progression is NOT my main responsibility at this stage of my life.
