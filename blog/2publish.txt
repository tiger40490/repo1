-- new: fixation on high school ranking]China
China gaokao is an objective, nation-wide benchmark, usable as a benchmark to rank thousands of high schools. Usable doesn't mean "meaningful", but the ranking (esp. within a city) is a constant fixation among parents.

Q: Why rank universities by the research output including prizes? Because universities exist to conduct research and guide public decision making. Research impact is a //yardstick of excellence and value-creation.

Q: Why rank unviersities by graduate employment [employer recognition, outstanding alumni,,,]? Because universities exist to groom young, productive knowledge-workers.

Universities build and polish their brands over decades, and use their brands to attract students, employer roadshows, staff, researchers/research-funding, donation,,, 
As in any domain, university brands compete for mind share. 

Do these factor apply to high schools? Partially. For example, it's rarely meaningful to benchmark high schools internationally, using pseudo-benchmarks like math Olympiad.

In the China high school landscape, the only real ranking criteria is benchmark result. This kinda ranking is highly emotive and over-emphasized, a national obsession. In many families, the obsession stems from parents' worry over "average high school" that usually means "no chance to a top college" like a 985/211 college.

Branding generates an emotional response among alumni, and a personal motivation to boost a alma-mater's ranking. 

Among my peers, the facination motivates us to monitor my alma-mater's ranking ... a recreational energy-sink.

-- new: livelihood shield won't fend off these"pains"
When we Struggle against or Cope with multiple /issues/, we often envy the affluent. We imagine their lives are less stressful, less frustrating, less burdened. Actually, "carefree bubble" depends on many factors such as number of dependents, amount of belongings (baggage), support network (citizenship?). However, this bpost is focused on the factor of livelihood (affluence). 

Even without livelihood issues/worries, some people (including my family-n-fiend) can feel real pains due to 
* physical pains
* psychological pains .. phobia, anxiety, depression...
* serious lack of self-discipline, or substance abuse, or addiction, in the self or a family member. Remember Biden's son.
* wasted personal potential? If livelihood fine, then the "waste" is tolerable?
* failure in love relationships (incl. non-starter)... "Affluence" doesn't meet this need.
* chronic family conflicts .. eg: me vs in-laws; between grandparents; sis vs grandpa
* injustice .. eg: See https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=24197&action=edit
* gross unfair treatment ... eg? losing a /rewarding/ job for a bitter reason like personality, or unfair dismissal

Bias of hindsight/rmSelf.. I would say a lot of times such an "event" does cause livelihood issues "for a while". Could be a few days to a few years. I guess many (rmSelf) dismiss the livelihood "stress" in hind sight, but in the midst of it the stress our xpSelf does feel non-trivial and permanent (just as covid19 felt like in 2020).

How about during the retirement phase? 
* work headaches reduced, but we may miss the engagement, the purpose, the F2F interaction. I would rather stay employed in a light-duty job, and endure some non-trivial stress
* Parenting pains reduced
* family conflict may reduce due to smaller family
* no more personal potential to waste
* I may be more dependent on others

==== update serenity bpost
-- trying too hard .. If you aim too high, and try too hard, you will get bruised all over.

I once tried moving up brank, OC-effective. Bruised all over.
quant career .. I made a real attempt for quant career. Too hard. Not worth the effort.
stretch .. In lower middle school I attempted very tough daily stretches. Too painful and unrewarding to continue.
perseverent_foreplay and higher intimacy frequency .. too much difficulty and conflict. I now aim lower... more at peace.
monthly div income .. in early 2010s I was aiming at 1k -> 2k average monthly, using mufu. Such a goal was too high even with U.S. stocks, so I gave up.
grandpa bathing .. grandma was aiming too high, trying too hard to persuade him.
English for wife.. I tried "improving" wife's English grammar and writing. Too difficult. See email in Oct 2023
wordy problems for boy and meimei .. 
EAE for boy .. I am trying too hard since the Jun seminar at NYP.

Health declaration form is much quicker with staff help than DIY

14d visa free... references checkpoint wall clock. 
If your Exit-from-China flight is unfortunately on Day#15 Early morning, you can avoid overstay by going through checkpoint 11.59pm on Day#14. Just go to airport the night before.
When you pass immigration upon Entry. The current day is taken as Day1. If landing at 23:45, you may want to delay passing to next day
Takeoff or landing timings don't matter -- immigration pass-through timing is the real factor.

-- update bpost on effective endeavor
Another effective intervention #unexpected

Throughout my career and family-building in Sg and US, my personal strategy [decisions, plann/executions, adjustments] about car ownership is .. surprisingly effective. 

Most of my peers "need" a car. They give various explanations of personal needs. It sounds like "so hard to cope without a car in this (part of) country", but I think what they mean is "Since I can afford [1] (to lease) a car, it is proving extremely convenient."

Many point to their own work/home locations, but hey, look at my choice of locations. I chose them to minimize car dependency.

[1] Affordability is personal. I can afford so I do fly up to 4/year for family reunion. Not essential, but a personal priority.

I did spend about USD 1k twice learning to drive. In 2018/19 I also practiced with zipcar. That's part of my effective endeavor.

-- add to bpost on 3-in-1 printer
~~new Printer driver install
After driver installation, sooner or later, we need an initial connection between the hardware. A common juncture of failure.

If cable is loose or printer is off, then you can check using device-manager -- unplugging/turning-off will remove an item immediately from device-manager; plugging/turning-on will add an item immediately to device-manager. Windows may also beep :) These are good signs. If you don't see any of these signs, then driver is broken or windows is broken.

Note Device manager is more low-level than Printers-n-scanners-page. It is able to show the new device earlier than PnSP can. Windows restart may be required before PnSP shows the new device.

Insufficient diskspace can mess up the installation in some strange way.

I prefer test-printing a single dot (notepad file). More ink-saving than a printer test page.

-- new: Hui Mei consultation#2
she recommends joint mgmt with psychologist.
No hurry though.

holiday feast .. soup first;  minimize starch otherwise; limit cakes to 6 pieces/meal (assuming regular size).
I was reluctant to set target, but now I like the idea.

fasting .. I described to her milk + fruits for entire day. If below 400cal/24H, then safe to practice twice a week. My fasting is 600cal+, so no safety concern.

After age 60, can aim for BMI=25, and maintain muscle mass.
Current BMI 21.x is very good for my age.

Going back to 63 kg .. probably not something to aim at.

Why I was able to achieve 65.5 kg .. awareness; conscious self-control.
