$2 wasted spend in Daiso .. is to be tolerated, given my nonwork incomes.
These spends won't accumulate beyond $1000/Y
ctbz in this case can be ineffective.

My due diligence (System 2) is sometimes too slow before spending such small amounts.  Let's record the small wasted spends so as to calibrate System 1.

-- slow cooking new 相形见绌 @interviews

When I meet an interviewer (or join a new tech team), I often notice a few individuals with superior technical capabilities. Most of these "superior" geeks are plump, less fit, with less healthy diets.

Many (but not a majority) of them, regardless of English skill, are also better communicators than me, but mostly am focused on tech competence -- where I often feel 相形见绌

Similar experience when I was trying out pre-sales and indepedent sales. I encountered many sales dragons. 

Similar experience when I meet an OC-effective peer like Shuo or Lunuo.Qiao. 

Somehow, subconsiouly and automatically I would brush aside the wellness differences, playing down my advantages. 

Well, at the deathbed or when well-off, what is more impotant? Personal Wellness or tech capabilities? I see no contest.

by a certian age like 45, we don't care so much about exclub or FOMO, and we can afford to ignore the smartphones (and other fancy, new stuff) that our cohort have.
I think this is a form of mellowing up, a form of let-go.

bluehost is well-regarded. hostgator is comparable to dreamhost in terms of
* pricing, 
* uptime .. usually "99%" 
* suppport .. 24/7 chat+email
* one-click WP install.

-- slow-cooking update post on Jiang.Zhu
Consider JackZ and Raymond's situations. At my age and (my economic) level, what endeavors (spaceshuttle name) are really strategic?
1) wellness lifestyle improvements like yoga, sustainable diet habits, BMI
2) dev-till-70 accu, plowback,,, including QQ and CIV
? academic parenting? No. I prioritize motivation, bonding, coaching 
? prepare for relocation to U.S. including car ownership, burn rate control

Jiang.Zhu is an unknown LeadEngineer figure that I last met in 1991. Both him and the Fenix CTO are largely unknown personalities, so my mental picture of them are imagined and fabricated content fitted onto a half-skeleton.
I guess for both of them, there is still a lot of untapped potential, a lot of drive, ambition. Compared to them, I probably look lazy. 
Well, at my age whenever I look out towards the deathbed I feel those "things" are unimportant.

Similarly to my "laziness", my son may look lazy. In contrast at age 13 I was more motivated, more ambitious than him.
