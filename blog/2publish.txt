Q: what form of money wasted (100k+) is irreversable?

eg(simplest): buying a deep OTM option
eg: investing in dubious unregulated securities like HY/PE, or bccy, or land banking
eg: buying expensive car.. As soon as you drive out, the car is worth 50% less 
eg: buying expensive medication.. Vendor won't accept return.
eg: borrowing a large sum from a financial lender. U-turn is "permitted" at a prohibitive cost. Might be 20% of the repayment quantum ($500k). Might have a minimum fee exceeding your loan quantum. 
eg: buying some expensive wines (seldom 100k). Once opened, you can't return it.

-- new: big stocks in U.S. vs China
I now feel China stocks are less familiar than U.S. stocks
* U.S. corporates answer to shareholders and try to create value for shareholders. (Same can be said of Singapore listed companies.) China's largest listed companies mostly answer to government. China companies seldom pay dividend. Out of the thousdans of China stocks, I'm sure some are well-managed, creating good shareholder values, but I don't know how to identify them.

* China A-shares are bought and sold mostly by retail investors. Retail investors are more irrational, leading to high volatility.

Q: when you read positive news about China stocks vs positive news about U.S. stocks, would you invest?

China news is state-controlled, esp. positive news. Even foreign news agencies are "influenced". No such thing in the U.S., because news organizations are skeptical or critical about the Fed, White House or other government agencies.

In terms of earnings, China listed companies are more affected by government policy than their American peers. American large-caps are more global than China large-caps, so the former are less affected by U.S. government policies. 

Fundamentally, China remains a command economy, where the CCP has tight control over most listed companies. The 2021-2022 crackdown on tech companies was a recent example. I can't think of such a crackdown happening in the U.S.

Therefore, predicting policy change is key to investing in China stocks. Public news is tricky to follow. ML.J told me as early as the 2000s that as a businessman in China, he finds policy reading a crucial business skill.

-- new: good person: intent^impact
Trigger: Since my 40s, I often explain my "good life" in terms of good karma. I guess karma is about consequences but I feel karma is also about intent.

Both Buddhism and Christianity share a tradition of forgiving and accepting ex-criminals, provided they are repentant/remorseful. Clearly, "Impact" is not everything if intention is a factor.

Trigger: Increasingly, I tell my family and friends (and I believe) that I'm a good person, but by what standard? We judge a person by her impacts on others around her, and her intensions. Kindness is one of the intensions.

Penal systems in many countries recognize both damage (a form of Impact) and intension. In contrast, most awards focus exclusive on impact.

On judgment day, when you stand before God or Yan2wang2ye2, what things count? Your impacts or your intensions?
