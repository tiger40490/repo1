Q: if wheelchair bound, do I automatically qualify for 2 out of 6?

what if I emigrate? Yes can claim from overseas
Can I downgrade to a smaller amount? not possible unless CPF balance too low.
Is premium amount in addition to elderShiled premium? Yes

Chance of survival beyond 12Y? If I put in the healing effort I will increase my chance. I can still be of value to my loved ones including my grandchildren. I want to live longer and experience more.

premium represents a $250/M burn rate .. a bit too high in my non-working phase. Risk of over-protection. Sizing should be done based on needs.. as we aren't affluent. 

Can I buy multiple policies and terminate one of them when no longer needed? Yes
split the $5k into 2 plans: $1300/12Y using medisave + $3700
