--update blogpost: chia seeds fiber
Is the fiber contributing to calorie intake? I feel answer is research-needed

Research show a non-trivial amount of fat content, but I don't feel any fat in its texture. Also, I would never eat more than 3 spoonful of chia seeds a day.

I feel chia seed is very filling yet tastes very different from any of the fatty or starchy foods in my life. This is the main reason for my belief in its slimming benefit.

--update blog: protein smoothie
Most of the "marketing" features and taste-enhancers are sugary, as majority of target consumers react to sugar.
Many sugary ingredients contain preservatives.
