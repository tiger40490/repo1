t_ska
Alcohol is much more than nutrition or health. 
Alcohol is social. We are judged. Your alcohol attitude is comparable to your attire or your transportation choices. As a more remote analog, golf is much more than a sport. As such alcohol is highly commercial.
Therefore there's a lot of sponsored research in the health effects of alcohol. These findings tend to dominate the discussions about alcohol.

There's too much misinformation and propaganda about alcohol. I have little bandwidth for that noise. Instead, I prefer simple, verified facts about alcohol:
* In human history, alcohol hae never been necessary for health or happiness. The health benefits have not become substantial.
* alcohol presents many risks not only to health

alcohol lifestyle might be important for some salemen but not me. Many of those OC-effective types tend to "advise" me to embrace alcohol. I used to feel weak and ineffective in my stubborn, "old-fashioned" attitude on alcohol. Well, now I like my attitude.

Q: In which area do you give much-needed sunshine but your peers don't bother to?

The question asks me to name where I give sufficient sunshine, so it's impossible to surprise myself, but I will still try to name unsung heros.

-- update blogpost on college ranking https://btv-open.dreamhosters.com/2020/09/21/university-rankings-hkindia/
Many familiar college names have an informal reputation among a small circle of my friends, sometimes just one guy.
The published ranking often challenges those informal and vague, often biased impressions. One concrete example is Princeton. A close friend wrote that "Princeton 本科是第一（USNews)，进入非常困难." I replied 

QS ranking -- https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/princeton-university is latest ranking, showing Princeton at #20
THE ranking -- https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/princeton-university shows Princeton  at #9
Good to recognize that not everyone thinks Princeton is the #1 best college. 

-- new: UChicago drop-out risk 
When I started at UChicago, what's the probability of drop-out like Shou.Liu, Henry.Yang and Chris.Ma? More than 30%

So the long journey demanded a lot of effort, commitment, perseverance ..

I needed a reason to continue. In hindsight, the branding is now fairly valuable in terms of self-image.

--new: G9 SMS to break away from mainstream brainwash
t_breakaway
* My wife always feels I look too thin for my health and appearance. I remind myself "I trust my BMI analysis -- Based on years of self-monitoring, My BMI goal is well-founded. Many in my cohort would probably get better healthy longevity if they adopt similar BIM goals."

Most of the other SMS messages are related to middle-class aspirations

* Many of my peers seem to suggest my family deserves higher BR. I focus on livelihood and believe a BR equal to 80% of local median income is reasonable and adequate. By that standard, many of my peers spend way too much. 
* branded college .. Can I accept if my kids only get into community college or polytechnic? This mainstream brainwash is still hitting me hard 
* home size
* car ownership .. In the U.S., and even in SG, my peers take up car ownership for convenience, not livelihood. 
* career longevity is more important than salary; healthy longevity is more important than financial security
