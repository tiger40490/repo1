--new: accept risks, not wholesale shutdown
eg: bedbugs. spraying and washing everything fabric, replacing all furniture.. doesn't buy you waterproof protection.
eg: covid19 lockdown. Even with full lock down, there's no such thing as riskfree.
eg: iPhone8 lock up
eg: overseas rental properties... I accept the risks rather than a blanket rejection. In any rEstate market, there's nothing riskfree.
eg: some stock investors only buy known names, but that doesn't protect them from capital loss. In this context, there's nothing riskfree.

CSY described the reaction of his 3 India-born contractors when manager anounced in a meeting the termination of their project. Project funding would end very soon.
Mgr promised to try and find other teams, but it's unlikely to have all 3 contractors retained.
CSY felt so much luckier because as perm he would have a job in other projects in the same team.

Therefore, he felt he would consider contract only if salary is 50% higher. Underlying reason -- his age and job search challenges are real. Dev-till-70 is not so easy.

This type of observation/experience reinforces the job insecurity "smell" of the contract career.

-- new: Vishal discussion
I thought Vishal would be wise to move earlier out of PMW to a more lucrative domain. 

I thought Vishal has the soft skills and political skills to move up. In the end he chose move-out rather than move-up.

I thought Vishal would be one of the key individuals to get well-compensated by GS (to keep him loyal). He said he was in a few years but overall paid below the market.

Vishal described some geopolitics which affected the compensation, promotion, workload...

I feel shaming was a big whiplash used in PWM. ( Now I feel Stirt tech used some shame, as I was unable to meet the VP benchmark.) Beware: Shame is usually a ping-pong -- If manager sends a signal but I refused to respond, then shaming is less effective.

peer benchmarking is shaming if too explicit....

For contractors, manager is less likely to use motivation techniques including shaming. Emotionally tiring... If she does, the contractor is more free [1] to quit, more so than H1b employees.

[1] In his home country, Vishal also has more freedom. )

Many GS techies simply quit after seeing the workload, the compensation, the expectation, the motivation/whiplash. As Vishal described, most of them has found happiness since they left.

mutual responsibility .. Both employer and employee have some responsibilities over the bad outcome, be it shame, burn-out or health issues. As in the "homeless" discussion, it's unfair to blame the system only, and never look inside the self.

I asked Vishal -- do you get used to the high stress of VP? 
Josh seemed to be very cool.

Vishal said that even though he became better at handling the work, it was still too much. The demands and expectations were probably increasing on him. Move up or move out. I think he was benchmarked with other VP's 

As to urgency, I now feel Josh is confident to cope with virtually all the incoming issues. Unconsciously he assigns a urgency level to each so he is never overwhelmed 

--new: western men overrated
at Shangrila, I saw many white men (also some Asian men), mostly fathers in my age group.
Mostly affluent families, based on my guestimate and intuition.

However, they don't seem to have the highest level of wellness that I used to associate with white men.

My decade-long inferiority is now put into question.

In terms of brbr, I have reason to believe I'm in much better "shape". The same evening, I discussed the same topic with the LZ.Yu family. For some individuals, excess cash balance is like desserts left in a fridge... will disappear sooner or later.

--update blogpost on wechat vs mail

.. Wechat voice mail
email is Much better than wechat voice mail for me... can archive, search, can respond a few days later at my own pace. 

I'm not sure but I guess some people might be using wechat voice mail too much for their own good. Voice mail can add stress to one's life because it is harder to manage compared to paper mail, email, online chats, mobile text message or in-person chat. (Note I do use voice mail myself, and I think they are valuable in some contexts.)

With a voice mail, if you don't respond, it just piles up in a tiny screen with 20 other voice mails (among 100 text messages), without any textual clue about their contents. It's unmanageable IMO. Therefore, the recipient is forced to respond right away. Unnecessary urgency, unnecessary stress. 

Maybe young people use wechat voice mail in a different way. (I won't speculate how or why.) I always prefer to receive messages with subjects and have the option to warehouse it until free to deal with it. Voice mail is unmanageable in my system.

Q: Can protein powder replace a meal?
With plenty of ice (chia seed is secondary) it did fill my stomach AND provide energy. However, the wrong-time temptation is overpowering for this poor substitute of a traditional meal
I think key is starch. Protein powder has no starch. chia, ice, protein powder can provide a full meal, but if you have had no starch for a while, then the temptations simply wipe out everything and you can feel hungry (hedonic) again. This is the nature of our senses. 

Try adding some cooked green beans, corn or rice into the smoothie

-- new: yongTauFoo+salad as stress relief
now at a time of stress, sitting outside Koufu food court, I really need some comfort food, to help me calm down.

However, not really hungry. No craving for ice cream or oily/starchy stuff (in fact, small portion of these foods would likely trigger a craving for bigger portion.. valuable self knowledge.)

Salad with some comfort components (not raw veg alone) is a good choice. Yong Tau Foo is a soup version of salad since raw veg is not popular in Chinese diet. It costs $5 but buys me mild stress relief without the cCost (and guilt/self-hate).

Now, in some cases I still need some more substantial comfort food. The big "salad" as a huge appetizer tends to reduce its portion.
