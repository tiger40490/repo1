--new: c++toolChain: archaic for new coders #yoga
one of the most obvious and real limitation/obsolete features of c++ as a language is the tool chain.
Part of the ecosystem
Just like manual cars, too complicated compared to newer languages like java. The dynamic scripting languages are even simpler. 

Also an entry barrier. Young people can take it up if determined, but majority of them are put off.

Q: A non-compSci graduate on a mid-career boot camp can take up programming in a scripting language or a simpler compiled language, but how many percent would take up c++? 

There's a minimum mileage required. Many young people don't stay on it long enough. 

My vi mileage is also too short.

Similarly, yoga is hard for most people but some individuals are determined and therefore able to overcome the initial hump (6-24M) and find joy and reward.

In my early days using c++, I tried to set up eclipse CDT and spent lots of time on the tool chain. My goal was to set up similar convenience ... Futile. Not worthwhile. java tools are miles ahead. Most c++ programmers don't bother with such convenience and rely on command line tools.

Just as I prefer command line, I often feel more confident (relative to my peers) with c++ tool chain

--new: ctbz: micro-saving add up over 9Y
Most adults or young people don't monitor their burn rate, calorie-quota or regular exercise. The cumulative effect would eventually show up.

* They waste numerous small amounts of money on a monthly basis. Over decades they "throw down the drain" a painful portion (like 10-20%) of their income.
* Large number of small time-wastage is similar. Some of us feel the pain only years later when our peers make progress in their spare time (or their office hours).
* calorie-quota overconsumption is cbtz. calorie-quota is a similar concept to carbon-quota. Each country each year is given a quota. If you over use bit by bit, then someday you need to borrow from the future quota.
* flexibility (+ muscule) declines with aging and requires periodic stretching, perhaps a few seconds each day -- ctbz

Among these scarce resources, usable time is the most scarce, available up to age 60 (only 55 for some).

This is a talent and a visible advantage. Among these talents, the most significant (used to be $) is calorie-quota budgeting. It has long-term health benefits.

Among these endeavors, my success is most visible and decisive in $$, and least in time-saving

This is one reason for my carefree life at this age when my peers endure stress. This (and other) freedom comes with responsibility.

--new: fix annoyances before stress spike
These annoyances can grow into stressors when my "healthcare system overwhelmed". Therefore, it's best to chip away at them when not under stress
* bofa credit balance cheques
* retrofitness extra charges
* tax filing
* hardware breakdowns
* repair/replace - home fixtures, electronics, 

Q: What kinda buffer would be effective against these random stressors? 
* short commute
* evening/weekend flexible work hours
* consistent time allocated to coding drill
* consistent time allocated to jogging, yoga and strength training
* adequate rest including sleep
* plenty of paid time-off
