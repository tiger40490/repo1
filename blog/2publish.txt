--new: avoid ham showing sesame-sized visible fat. 
As stupid as fried peanuts, fried finger foods, alcohol... High calorie density but no pleasure whatsoever. 

--new: how I developed the late night supper habit
In my late teens or early 20's, I discovered that my mental sharpness, productivity peak at night. I guess the mental energy need fuel at night
--new: weight=surprise cornerstone@MY wellness
Just as QQ is a surprise cornerstone of my entire career, weight is the surprise cornerstone of my wellness
--new: family should be realistic about boy's weight
On one hand, we want to be optimistic about boy's weight
On the other hand, statistically, most overweight kids aren't successful in losing weight

I need to be the role model in his life just like grandpa was in my life.

--new: weight-loss: popular yet ineffective ideas. Note life science is fundamentally different from physical science, as individual differences often surprise us.

In my body, these diet tips failed completely:

* heavy breakfast, light dinner
* reduce snacking
* no big meal after dinner like 8pm
* consistent meal timing
* fewer meals

--new: loss-ratio of each workout
mini-exercise has low overhead .. low loss
group class and jogging ... continuous. Low loss
swimming has the poorest ratio
cycling is too light.. poor ratio

--new: the visible path towards lower BMI - fasting
Some may call it yoyo diet. I call it random fasting. No consistent discipline needed.

Most days I would skip some meals.
Some "heavy" days I would eat bigger meals including dinner
Some "light" days I would skip most meals and eat light dinner.
Some lucky days I would skip dinner or have veg salad for dinner

I now feel intermittent fasting is more effective than abstinence.

--new: replace whole milk with lite icecream@@
Update -- ice cream is more addictive, even if not more fattening.

Is icecream fattening. It feels like similar to whole milk.

--new blogpost: nuts
Very few people point out the high fat + high calorie content of just a handful of nuts. See the picture of 100g of nuts in the other blogpost.

A spoonful of nuts has roughly the same fat as a spoonful of butter/mayo, is equally addictive but nut oil is higher quality and comes with fiber.

I like the Raffles magazine summary – need portion control .. limit to tiny amount of nuts…. so tiny that I would rather eat a big serving once a few months.

I think tiny amount of nuts are good for salad.

My son doesn’t need so much heart-healthy fat. He can enjoy nuts but in very small quantity

--QnA with Dr Steffy
#1 take-away -- Need to keep up exercise as a reconfirmation/revaldation of my extreme diet towards lower BMI.

Consider Hep vaccination

Q: starch reduction towards zero?
A: starch reduction towards zero is safe. However, Compared to fruit sugar, starch is be more lasting and more filling.

Q: reduce BMI towards 19?
A: safe. 18.5 is the limit, as long as you have enough energy, and you feel healthy. (See the #1 take-away)

Q: As layman I believe appearance doesn't indicate health. My wife said I look unhealthy since too thin but I believe I can become still slimmer and be healthy.. right?
A: YES

Q: Fasting for multiple days is safe? I sometimes fast for a day or longer when my body could tolerate. Is it safe?
A: Depends. People fasting for multiple days need gradual training, so stomach gradually reduces acid production.
A: Therefore, intermittent fasting is safer

Q: I now plan to reduce my big meal. In addition, I will reduce or eliminate my smaller meals.
A: nodding

Very low BMI can lead to low bone density and brittle bones. You can check bone density every 2 years.

Q: I now believe my biggest risk area is heart, followed by cancers and bones
A: nodding

Q: I guess I would need to live with Lipitor for life
A: it's OK to depend on Lipitor for life.

Q: Any way to live without lipitor? 
A: Red rice yeast

Q: I take 1/3 a pill once in 2 days, and I sometimes forget for a week
A: it's OK. Do consider the 10mg pills

--white blood cell count
Q: any concern over white blood cell?
A: your case is not due to viral infection, so you may have a low baseline. Very common in this region.

Q: why such big variation like 3.1 to 2.55 ?
A: That's Normal. variation is inherent in the measurement.

Q: what level would be worrying?
A: we look at the various types of white blood cells and their ratios.
Now I feel I should check white blood cell once a while.

--new: simple tips@spreadsheet 
In spreadsheets, prefer '4~6' rather than '4-6' as the latter is automatically cast as a date !

prefer ranking with a/b/c than 5/4/3 in excel -- opportunity to highlight with capital-letters

--new: why avoid locking on boxed Intergers
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34049186/why-not-lock-on-a-value-based-class section on "UPDATE - 2019/05/18" has a great illustration

Auto-boxing of "33" usually produces distinct objects each time, but can produce the same object repeatedly. Compiler has the freedom to optimize, just as in c++.

--new: java value-based types
Optional.java is the only important example we know.

One of the main ideas about value types is that they have no notion of identity (or perhaps their identity is detectable only to JVM not Java applications). In such a world, how could we tell whether variables aa and bb "really" are the same or different?

Q: why avoid locking on value-based objects?
%%A: locking is based on identity

c++ has a smaller community and collective brain power 

--new: intellij=cleaner than eclipse
intellij (even the community version) is much cleaner than eclipse

My choice of java ide is based on
1) other developers in the team, as I need their support

2) online community support -- as most questions are usually answered there
I think eclipse beats intellij 

3) longevity -- I hate to learn a java ide and lose the investment when it disappears. 
I think eclipse beats intellij, due to open-source

*)other factors include "clean" 

The most popular tools are often vastly inferior for me. Other examples:
* my g++ install in strawberryPerl is better than all the windows g++ installs esp. msvs
* my git-bash + strawberryPerl is a better IDE than all the fancy GUI tools
* wordpress beats blogger.com hands down
* wordpad is a far simpler rich text editor than msword or browsers or mark-down editors
