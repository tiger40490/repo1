--new: boycott to FOMO
t_powerDescriptor
my current carefree life rests upon boycott to FOMO. 
However, my benchmark fixation, SDXQ fixation.. are major breaches to this boycott

Luckily my myopia has stablized over 30 years.

--new: c++coping with x-lang benchmarks
For c++ to hold its ground in those simplistic, numerical, high volume, speed tests,
* no new no malloc. Use stack and data segment
* no STL no std::string no shared_ptr
* optimize d-cache and i-cache
* use compile-time programming

For java, 
* any GC has some stop-the-world phase, so prevent all GC.

--c++ref: Y we can't take its address
t_clarify
A pointer is conceptually a runtime object, occupying runtime memory, with an address. (Actual implementation, by compiler, of the pointer could be different, but another can of worm for another day.)

A ref is strictly a compile-time symbol and never a runtime object, so it may have no address at runtime. I suspect compiler may replace it with the referent variable.

Such a reference is like a syntactical sugar, mostly for func params. Then came rvr to challenge all of these notions.

--update on plowback
I often feel the urge to plowback and strengthen the shields..

I think zbs and GTD (except tool knowledge) are overrated in terms of plowback. In contrast, IV body-building is a worthwhile plowback.
Industry-wide dnlg? Not so effective as a form of plowback.
fitness? Excellent Plowback 
stock investment? Too time-consuming, not worthwhile.
parenting? Yes takes huge amount of time but 90% inefficient in terms of plowback
English (and Chinese) vocab?

..plowback my savings to buy a shorter commute
* increase nonwork income to support lease spread
* spend time (huge amount) helping kids' studies
* save up for 43R model
* save up for a private school in an average school district
