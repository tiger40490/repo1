-- new: too well-off
In 2021 I described myself as too well-off to feel the hunger for more earning power.
growing fat and happy.

Well-off is less than rich or wealthy.

Context was my tech learning and localSys learning energy.

-- update blogpost on bluechips vs mufu
Q: if a mufu like DIVA can pay 4% dividend, what's the advantage of MOETF hitting DYOC 4% after tax?
A: I doubt a mufu can generate 4% DYOC consistently without eroding NAV. I don't think I have seen any. Let's check out DIVA
A: an ETF will probably beat the mufu in terms of annual fees
A: MOETF will beat ETF on a few fronts. Financially, I could liquidate individual constituent stocks.

However, I do agree that dividend tax is a disadvantage of MOETF. Luckily, as U.S. tax payer, my annual income would be so low that my marginal tax rate would be far below 20%.

Tcost is another disadvantage but as an recreational investor I treat it as recreation and learning. Anti-aging.

-- new: risk@100% loss in stock pickig
I guess this is one justification (marketing?) for equity mufu.

For any stock to receive $200 of my money, it has to be rather solid, reputable, with a convincing trec.

If such a stock pick still goes bankrupt, then I will accept the result and accept personal responsibility. The initial amount is risk capital anyway.

I think the probability for hitting a bankruptcy among my non-trivial stocks, within 10Y, is 10% [1]. My loss would be ... 5% of my portfolio. But Expense Ratio of a mufu easily adds up to 20% of my portfolio value.

[1] The probability estimate depends on my count of non-trivial stocks. Am assuming 100+

--update blogpost on becoming lifestyle
Most people accept that they would 1) want to stop working sometime in their 60's 2) not be accepted by employers at that age, unless they are doctors, accountants or professors.

Therefore, they don't work to build career longevity. Most likely they won't achieve career longevity. Their lifestyle is part of the reason. 

I don't accept that lifestyle.

.. is not wellness condition
David's answer -- refusal to talk to parents
Grandpa's answer -- running away from home

My answer is -- effort. If he puts in effort but ends up with those results, I feel I would love him unconditionally. I recall XR's autistic son.

Teresa Teng was not a strong math student but worked hard at every subject.

Currently, despite his piano practice, his poor effort everyday is eroding the loving relationship. Unconditional love is under threat. Boy is very sensitive and can probably sense it.

Grandma notices the tension between two forces inside me. She drew this analogy -- imagine your sponse is diagnoised with cancer. You experience the huge pressure to take on the huge legwork and decide on treatment options for the spouse. At the same time, you may also feel the tendency to reject the cancer, and blame the cancer, but the cancel won't go away. Grandma said the 2nd, negative emotion is counterproductive. Yet it is real and common. 
I feel this is a good analogy. The cancer may be incurable. You still have a job to fight it and slow down its progression.

Remember Biden's love for his son, despite his drug problem. I would say he is still a successful father. Indeed a father would be successful if he did his best to stop the progression of such an addiction.

In the same blogpost, there's also a gay son's story. Is that an "effort" problem?

I'm no perfect child. If I have a son like me, is there something I can't accept? Theft!

My son has no aggression, no cruelty, no dishonesty,,,, that's why I find his laziness unacceptable.
