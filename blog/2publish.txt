AMB looks so daunting but someday I Will find a traction/vision secret

boy's math coaching... My new vision secret is .. put aside benchmarks and try to increase his intrinsic motivation by 1%. Possibly insignificant, but better than nothing.

-- update post on deathbed
GexAcademy Chairman Patrick, Lee Hom... all show high net worth in the millions. H.Yi mentioned a fellow developer friend having 3M net assets. Well I don't feel envious.
After ffree, or at our deathbed, marginal benefit of one more million is not that important. More important are family harmony, successE (carefree ezlife with wellness), succcessZ.

==new or update: ##unlisted capabilities for IV
Some of these unlisted requirements are more essential than listed ones, effectively filter out many candidates, and represent my competitive advantages on a given job market.

-- capability: oral English skill .. some interviewers require a certian level of fluency, but that level is never listed explicitly.
-- capability: QQ .. [basic OO, basic algo, basic language nlg, basic number theory, ,] Actually, these are not basic, not used on the job for 20Y
-- capability: number theory
-- capability: whiteboard
Most candidates are unused to whiteboard coding while explaining. 

Even harder when stuck and following hints from interviewer.

We are often rejected for ECT speed, or communication, or poor use of whiteboard real estate
-- capability: ECT, BP
The minimum standard is usually non-trivial, and requires practice.

-- take on student's role .. Josh mentioned the attitude of a student (even though he meant something else). If you were a reluctant student in school and only studied to pass exams and have never since "looked back", then you may find the dev interview process tough and challening. It requires you to go back into student mode. Specifically you have to review your past material + weaknesses, pick some topics, form some plan, study for weeks in your spare time, without a teacher.

I think this is one fundamental reason I feel strong among my cohort.
