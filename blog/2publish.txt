-- new: 爷爷托梦
“我尽力了”
Q: 你有尽力多活几个月吗？
“最后这一年，晚上都睡不着， 早上起来全身没劲。 吃饭没有味道， （这里的食物没你妈做得好）。 生活没有乐趣。 走路也走不动。”

“不痛苦” 
Q: 你没害怕吗失去生命的那一刻吗？
“我是勇敢的， 抗美援朝的时候，战友这么说"

Q: 上次来看你那次，一月初，你记得临走我对你说的最后一句话吗？
“你叫我夜里不要起身自己上厕所， 要我按铃”

"好孩子。你是孝顺的孩子。”

孙子： “我相信TYX， 会有出息.” 
“TYX 将来是个有出息地孩子”

“你妈是他们的师母，名副其实”
“你妈有时候脾气不大好， 但是对我的照顾，几十年，无微不至。 靠她，我才活到最后这一天。 照顾我她很辛苦。 你作为儿子， 有义务赡养你母亲。 这是我的心愿， 也是我对你的要求。 我知道， 你姐姐和你， 不会扔下你妈妈不管。”

Q: 你有没有遗憾我没见你最后一面？ 
“就算我离世之前你赶到了， 我也看不见你。 前一天晚上， 我睡过去没再睁开眼， 任何人我都看不见。” 

坐厦门航空 MF8118 从北京大兴起飞， 飞机在倾斜地攀升. 正闭目养神， 脑海里竟然浮现出爷爷熟睡离世的面容。 下巴还开着 （戴了几天几夜的呼吸机刚摘下）， 样子怪可怜的。 但无痛苦悲戚， 没有无奈挣扎，也没有想要唉声叹气而又说不出的迹象。 四肢舒展，右膝向外略弯。 更像在做梦。
我心里豁然明朗，爷爷一生可圈可点，没做过坏事，两袖清风。 好人有好报，一定是上了天堂，这个时候在天空中和我相遇，提醒我别忘了他离开人间那一刻的姿态。 他那个独特的样子，只有我注意到。 过了一阵子他下巴放松了，变得更像任何一个沉睡地老头子，反而没有了他的个人风格。
这一次经历似乎是有意安排的。 他去世之后， 我第一次坐飞机升空， 爷爷立刻发给我暗示， 暗示他已经升进了天堂， 暗示我不必挂念他了， 也暗示我别忘了，在离开人世那一刻他独特的面容。

most serious breach known to me is IP leak
Electronic leak is the most common. Printout of IP is tracked, and we are not supposed to bring them out of the door.

Copying commercial software license to home .. is a breach, but may not be so serious.

Q: can we increase statin to reverse CAD?
For any CAD patient, plaque build-up is hard to reverse. No reliable evidence of any effective treatment.
I once reached LDL=51. It was safe. 
Reduce LDL to 70 for a few years, and you might see reversal.
Ezetrol is safe.
Repatha is proven to reduce LDL and heart attack risk. But plague reversal using Repatha is unproven.

Q: can I go on extreme diet to reverse CAD?
A: not recommended, but it's safe to reduce all fatty foods.

Q: atherectomy ?
A: Singapore uses coronary atherectomy too, but only for very tough plaque, not really for reversing my level of CAD.

early sleep .. boy's noise... light sleeper.
AA: bring boy to see me (Dr Leow). Late sleep can increase risk of heart attack.

My mom takes blood pressure daily. Yes she needs it. Do I need to buy a device to check at home? No

Q8: Was my progression that fast over 3 years? from zero to 50%? Perhaps not zero 3Y ago?
AA: correct. There could be some blockage in 2021.

Q8b: Will it continue at a slower pace if I take these medications? A: Yes!
Q8c: But slower pace still implies I may need stenting in a few years?
AA: possible. All depend on on periodic ESE results

Over 20Y horizon, stent failure rate is 10-20%, so 80%+ of stent patients don't need rework for 20Y+.

Q: Yoga and pilate workout can feel difficult (heavy breathing), but are they lighter than jumping exercises? 
AA: Yes

Do I need to learn how to recognize angina?
A: there are many angina symptoms including some minor discomfort
A: GTN not effective for me. Tablets like aspirin blood thinner are also unsuitable since it can backfire in some cases
%%A: I believe GTN and tablets are not needed for my current level of risk. For some reason, doctor won't put it that way.

After checking my blood results and blood pressure, Dr Lew said that given my age, I will need stent in a number of years, but the longer we can safely put it off, the better, as stent technology will improve.

Is my sildenafil affected by the three drugs you prescribed? 
A: No. 
A: GTN + sildenafil is proven dangerous

Q: future CT results will need to be interpreted with this FFR report?
A: Standard CT will not be suitable.. wait for newer technology

Q: how do I monitor the build-up over next 10y?
A: ESE (exercise stress echo) every 2Y, or 1Y minimum
A: Standard treadmill test will give false positives.

What can I do about hypertension risk? I guess same as everyone else i.e. manage risk facctors

I have gastritis ... so some blood thinners are unsafe? 
AA: Even aspirin can be safe, if taken after (within 15m or with) meal

How do I watch out for liver damage due to Lipitor? 
AA: blood test every 6M

Is my blood pressure likely to rise? 
AA: yes but only due to aging, not stent

Q: will stent procedure leave the smaller plagues (below 50% blockage) untreated? Will they build up? Improvement is impossible.
AA: Scenario 1: doesn't build up over many years
AA: Sceanrio 2: worsening.. further intervention

How safe is chin-up, or push-up, skip-rope etc? AA: safe after wrist heals
How safe is climbing stairs and squat? AA: yes after 2 weeks
How safe is slow run up a small hill? AA: safe
How safe is 100m continuous swim? AA: safe
Most people need 30min of aerobic exercise 5 times a week... How aobut me? AA: same for me

grapefruit juice can interfere with statin but grape juice is safe

nuts and peanut-butter can be beneficial?
AA: eat in moderation. Better than fried or coated peanuts.

What causes do you see? 
AA: genetics + aging

For young men with family history, start checking cholesterol after 20.

Is atherectomy a safe option for me?
AA: higher risk. Good option when it's necessary (lesser of two evils) such as hardened plaque. 

Q: What if I miss 1 or 2 times a week?
AA: don't double up on the next day

Q: how do I know that work stress is actually affecting my heart health?
AA: chest tightness, short of breath while climbing even short stairs
Q: how about mild discomfort around the heart
AA: yes can be a sign

Q: competitive running/jogging .. fall at the end? Yes dangerous to the heart. Immediate medical attention required.
AA: Aim at endurance and don't sprint. Maintain pace. 
%%A: My younger-day habit of all-out sprint in the last lap is no longer safe at my age

Q: In early Apr, you told me my risk of heart attack is quite high so I need an angioplasty within a month. Is my risk profile improved so much that I don't need to constantly worry about heart attack?
A: After the angiogram, my risk of heart attack is below 1% within 1-2Y. Blockage is at most 50% despite what he wrote in the discharge summary.

Q: test for insulin in blood in addition to hbA1c, to guage my risk of diabetes?
A: no need

Q: EDyw since early 2023 .. could it be due to my plaque build-up?
A: possible, but any man above 45 has increased risk.

workout 
.. 20km without pushing to the limit? No recommended
.. can I train for JPM5600 2025? yes

Q: CoQ10 .. good for me if my mom asks me to try?
A: harmless but probably not needed given my medications

GP doctor prescription ... requires SGH pharmacy visits (2-3H round trip). Each prescription should say 100mg. Needs my contact number.

-- update bpost on bone/muscles
My bubble has yet to derail or puncture.
Now, among the non-overweight, there is a high probability of muscle loss. I am good so far.
By now, I have largely avoided the "magnetic field" of overweight. My enviable BMI can come at disproportionate cost
* Older adults often need to fight, on their back heels, an uphill battle to retain muscles. Losing muscle can reduce your BMI but it also affects your metabolism rate
* amputation can reduce your BMI, but do you want that?

DRD for grandpa's log-in
This is more sensitive than my own icbc/psbc log-in, so let's be prudent during the drill

-- update bpost on long-term SG inflation
K.Hu suggested roaming retirement to Malaysia. Singapore is susceptible to imported inflation but not Malaysia.
Switzerland citizens don't have a next-door neighbor as a low-cost retirement destination. (Spain?) Sgp has JB.

Some x% annual inflation over some 15Y translate to perhaps 50% commulative inflation in Sgp. Malaysia cost level is much lower and will address that level of commulative inflation.

SGX blue chip stocks are an inflation hedge. 

STI ETF? has expRatio, inferior to single names

SP500 ETF is a classic inflation hedge.

A similar experience to share -- Mixed vegetable-rice (杂菜饭) is my default choice when I eat alone. In June 2024 I went to a low-cost street venue (without Aircon), and bought a regular 杂菜饭 -- two-veg-one-meat for $5.50. Used to cost $3.50 ~$4, perhaps 10 years ago. 

For a historical comparison I need to hold every variable constant:
* location .. food court (with Aircon) is my current default. Frequently, I do choose cheaper place like this June venue
* portion .. one-meat-one-veg-on-rice (一菜一肉) is my default. Frequently, I do get 1 or 2 additional items like this June case

$2 was my cost level some (20) years ago. Now the same food costs $3.50 minimum. When I see a price display of $6 for 杂菜饭, I get a sinking feeling (心里一沉) and immediately urge myself to cut down to two-veg-on-rice. Less often, I would tell myself I'm not really hungry and can wait until I reach office or home, where low-cost healthy foods await.

Q: how much would the same food cost (in the same place) in 2035? Probably below $7. My optimism.

My son may start working full time in 5 years, without a degree, and make $3k/M. $6 a meal translates to about $15/day. With that salary he has to cut down on food cost.

Even though food is an essential expense, food inflation is my least worry because ... many (reasonably healthy) choices exist. In contrast, I care more about medical, housing+utilities, public transport.

If 15GB insufficient for wife, we can buy additional "data pack" for one month.

Once you buy, it auto-renews monthly. That's the official (bad) answer. Such a "deal" is inferior to a bigger monthly plan. However, in reality, monthly data packs are better due to flexibility. You can cancel auto-renewal after one month.
