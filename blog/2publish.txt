--new: ffree^FOMO: big-ticket spends 
useful to zoom into the biggest discretionary spends. 

If I benchmark with those earning 200k, my wife and kids would want vacations to Japan, Europe... When I tell them "not necessary", they might feel impoverished? Not sure.

Figures below are monthly outlays.
.. USD 5k/M mortgage + prop tax. USD 4k-6k
They would want a bigger home. I can accept a small home, but prime location!
Wife would want a top school district.
.. USD 2k/M/child private school 
.. USD 1k/M private car. Figure is total cost, depends on usage
They might want a brand new car, not pre-owned.
.. USD 1k/M/child enrichments. Figure varies a lot.
