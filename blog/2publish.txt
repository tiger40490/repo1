I heard a departing colleague's truthful reflections including the reasons for the departure. One of the reasons is related to comp benchmark. I guess (with good level of confidence) that he feels that given his value-add and effort, he should receive $XX more (whatever XX is).

The more one dwells on it, the more one would feel unfair -- Someone else in the same team has the same level of value-add but was rewarded much more.

It's a valuable protection that I don't put in extra effort and sacrifice for the manager. It protects me from the hazard of harmful comparision. If you don't compare, you feel satisfied. If you do, your bubble bursts and derails.

At my age, I don't salary-benchmark as much as in my 30s -- I don't care so much about wasting my potential, my spare capacity. It's good and bad. 

It's bad if I am chronically underpaid (20% below market) like J.Zhang.
It's good if my employer and my manager is generous and keen to retain older SWEs like me.

-- LG2 new: when we size up someone: socioeconomic
First impression is like judging a book by its cover. Focus in this bpost is socioeconomic strata. Let's stick within 5 elements: 

physical wellness [posture, skin, dental] .. 5% ~~> 25% of my assessment
educated and sophisticated vocab/articulation/manners .. continues to be 45%
ethnicity/nationality/accent .. 50% ~~> 30%, esp. relevant when sizing up caucasians
.. citizenship is usually unknown. Here am talking about apparent nationality.

Dress .. is not a factor but often a subtle hint of education, income, and socioeconomic strata.
