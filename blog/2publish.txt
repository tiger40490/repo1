~~ control over BMI
Rahul was very determined and in-control, but he might be somewhat overweight.

Many of my colleagues are overweight. I tend to assume they have poor control over diet or exercise, but I could be very wrong. 

Some slim individuals are not really better at self-control. I guess some of them are just lucky. I have many colleagues who said they are unable to put grow "stronger".

This "control" is central to successZ, but if our boy "system" is hard to control, then I think we need serenity. See the bpost on serenity
