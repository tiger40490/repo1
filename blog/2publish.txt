20 years after graduating, one thing I remember about my NUS performance (relative to other schools) was the 2nd-class honors. I think a big factor is the final year project, or perhaps having two D's automatically disqualifies me from first-class honors.

There's no point analyzing it, since we have no inside knowledge.

In contrast, my UChicago grades are much better -- mostly A's and one or two B's

Therefore, I fared better in math than engineering.

-- new: super-strength^super-longevity
As boys, we dreamed of super strengths like in legends .. childish
A more realistic dream is super longevity. It requires

effort, absorbency
luck, genes
healthcare "infrastructure" of the local government. It often provides low-cost high-quality care.
healthcare resources of your family or organization. It usually costs millions

-- update blogpost on y-junction
jolt
even though my shoulder joint is unable to extend up to 180 degrees, it's not preventing any yoga poses. It only makes "poor form" or forces me to take on modified poses.

In contrast, my Y-junction inflexibility does render some yoga poses unattainable.

-- fuxi or update on recreational
my analysis of a stock often hits dismal ROTI because I only buy up to $100.
I feel the tension between two forces
* self-hate due to low ROTI, low commitment amount... tolerable for recreational
* if I bet bigger, I hit high tcost (due diligence + holding tcost) and much higher risk.

Diversifying is not that effective due to high correlation.

The most promising solution is bigger buy-n-forget, buy-n-hold for dividend.

I can also stick to recreational investing, and keep my portfolio NAV below $20k.
--new: longevity=elusive,finHealth can be strengthened
longevity health is elusive but financial health, in contrast, can be strengthened. Key drivers are 1) higher nonwork income and 2) burn rate control 3) maintain salary (a topic for another blog)

Assets to acquire:
* safe high-div stocks like O:US
* risky high-div assets, like HY/PE
* risky low-div high-growth assets, like SIA

Jill's products do not provide truly reliable current income. They are less reliable than many div stocks.

gold?

easier to sell, as one independent unit, rather a tiny part of a bigger unit.

far more tenants.

more mature CBD, with more proven real estate demand

why I have two healthy kids? Largely due to the Effective mother

--cohort .. a very useful word in my writing.
same age group
Should greplace in my blogs
--update blogpost on becoming lifestyle
Most people accept that they would 1) want to stop working sometime in their 60's 2) not be accepted by employers at that age, unless they are doctors or professors.

Therefore, they don't work to build career longevity. Most likely they won't achieve career longevity. Their lifestyle is part of the reason. 

I don't accept that lifestyle.

--new: worst unacceptable outcome@boy
.. is not benchmark disappointments including career progression
.. is not wellness condition
David's answer -- refusal to talk to parents
Grandpa's answer -- running away from home

My answer is -- effort. If he puts in effort but ends up with those results, I feel I would love him unconditionally. I recall XR's autistic son.

Teresa Teng was not a strong math student but worked hard at every subject.

Currently, despite his piano practice, his poor effort everyday is eroding the loving relationship. Unconditional love is under threat. Boy is very sensitive and can probably sense it.

Grandma notices the tension between two forces inside me. She drew this analogy -- imagine your sponse is diagnoised with cancer. You experience the huge pressure to take on the huge legwork and decide on treatment options for the spouse. At the same time, you may also feel the tendency to reject the cancer, and blame the cancer, but the cancel won't go away. Grandma said the 2nd, negative emotion is counterproductive. Yet it is real and common. 
I feel this is a good analogy. The cancer may be incurable. You still have a job to fight it and slow down its progression.

Remember Biden's love for his son, despite his drug problem. I would say he is still a successful father. Indeed a father would be successful if he did his best to stop the progression of such an addiction.

In the same blogpost, there's also a gay son's story. Is that an "effort" problem?

I'm no perfect child. If I have a son like me, is there something I can't accept? Theft!

My son has no aggression, no cruelty, no dishonesty,,,, that's why I find his laziness unacceptable.

-- new: socially awkward 
BillGates and Mark Z were described as socially awkward in school. 

I was very awkward in middle school. Slowly found my confidence in high school. 
Humor (and wit) is something I lack in most group settings. In Shiyan I had a bit of wit, but not humor.

Watching the Mr.Bean episode "Exam", I recall that most western men strike me as comtemporary and polished. But I beat most of them in studies (bigO), in self-discipline (Gary.G), in wellness, in brbr/FullerWealth, even in analytical writing.


--update blogpost on exp recon (https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=13923&action=edit)
.. annual budgets? I have two alternatives.
1) I tend to have a long-term savings target i.e. what percentage of my salary (eg 100k) is saved to banks or invested. Not exactly a savings target, but I have a spreadsheet tracking couple's NAV.

2) I tend to rely on my expense recon. One practical value of it -- setting an expectation for the "next 3M outlays". As such, expense recon largely displaces annual budget.

In theory, it's useful to set simple, single numbers for annual budget, annual savings (including investments).. but in reality, it's time consuming to separate out investments, transfers etc. The effort is low roti. Therefore, I focus on monthly expense recon.
