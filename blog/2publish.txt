-- new: livelihood won't fend off these"pains"
Even without livelihood /issues/, some people (including Family-n-Fiend) can feel real pains due to 
* injustice .. eg: See https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=24197&action=edit
* gross unfair treatment ... eg?
* .. losing a /rewarding/ career for a bitter reason like personality, or unfair dismissal
* failure in love relationships (incl. non-starter)... "Livelihood" doesn't meet this basic need.
* chronic family conflicts .. eg: me vs in-laws; grandparents; sis vs grandpa
* wasted personal potential? If livelihood fine, then the "waste" is tolerable?

Bias of hindsight .. I would say a lot of times the "event" cause livelihood issues "for a while". Could be a few days to a few years. I guess many dismiss the livelihood "stress" in hind sight, but without hindsight the stress feels non-trivial and permanent (like covid19 appeared in 2020).

-- new: good person: intent^impact
Trigger: Since my 40s, I often explain my "good life" in terms of good karma. I guess karma is about consequences but I feel karma is also about intent.

Both Buddhism and Christianity have tradition of forgiving and accepting ex-criminals, provided they are repentant/remorseful. Clearly, "Impact" is not everything when intention is a factor.

Trigger: Increasingly, I tell my family and beyond (and I believe) that I'm a good person, but by what standard? We judge a person by her impacts on others around her, and her intensions. Kindness is one of the key intensions.

Penal systems in many countries recognize both damage (a form of Impact) and intension. In contrast, most awards focus exclusive on impact.

On judgment day, when you stand before God or Yan2wang2ye2, what things count? Your impacts or your intensions?
