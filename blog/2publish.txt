--new: biggest c++ coding projects #$5k DBS
In 2015 I toyed with the outlandish idea of applying for a $5k/M DBS job just to get a hardcore big-project c++ dev experience.

The criteria for "big" depends on the skill you want to demonstrate or learn.

* If you mean build tool for large codebase then MS is largest, followed by Macq MTS and Macq quant. 

* If you mean actual substantial source code size that demonstrates large team BestPractices, data structures, threading,,, then my NYSE integrated feed parser is largest 
followed by my weekend coding interview projects. Mvea is next biggest.

It's worthwhile to review those weekend projects, mostly hosted in cppProj
