"called" sounds unclear and ambiguous. Consider "telephoned".

-- update blogpost on more/less
Fact: for some of us, we always feel insufficient allocation to this or that aspects of our lives. (To be fair, occasionally do we feel some over-allocation.)

To address that, I need to slow down on new work projects.

Our t-allocation decisions are dynamic, fluid and largely run by System1, therefore never precise and /impeccable/. 
I feel the need to constantly review my allocation decisions over short and long histories, and adjust.
I mean Allocation of time + System2 resources [attention, energy, absorbency...]

The higher ground I want to push toward is a situation where I find very few items constantly starved/underserved, and ideally the short-term "starvation" is more evenly spread out across.
On this higher ground, I would really remember a few (temporary) success stories of adjustment. The success stories empower me to endeavor to correct/adjust my allocation strategy, and avoid the familiar "powerless guilt" driven by the /tyrany/ of perfectionism.

In recent months, 
I have decreased tech xx including deep_work, compared to years ago (partly due to dimishing return), replaced with practical scripting, automation, localSys,,, 
I have :) reduced fren dialog t-spends and created temporary starvation
I have :) maintained workout t-spends
I have :) increased family time, esp. with boy and meimei
I have experienced inreasing demand (on my Sys2 resources) from BGC, Cambodia, US tax, US stocks, USD TD,,,
I have :) reduced Diyhi t-spends
I have :) increased jogg and yoga, and reduced chin-up 
I have increased pff t-spends
I have increased blogg (and other efforts) as self-care. As noted in the blogpost on I-statement, my type of blogging is not easy, not lazy, takes training and effort.

^^ Now I don't feel the burn [self-discipline, with materialistic gains]
My father, in his twilight years, would probably prefer quiet peaceful time,,, not burn.

Perhaps my current t-allocation is nearly /optimal/, based on the successE definition

-- update bpost on Sgrn
There are shrewed/sharp, motivated/ambitious individuals from any rich or poor country. Here I briefly look at the populous developing countries such as China and India. Some of these individuals receive a decent education in their (low-income) home country or as a foreign student in a developed country.....

These kids belong to a rich "extended family" -- the Sgp nation.
Perception of Sgp nation is more positive. I will skip the list of adjectives.

-- new: which country to call home
I can imagine a (legal or illegal) immigrant to the U.S. (or SGP) without GreenCard. She has lived most if not 98% of her life in the U.S. (perhaps born there) and is more familiar with U.S. than her original country, but she has a relatively priviledged life in her original country (wealth, family network/relationships, status,,,)

Q: which country does she call home?
%%A: her original country, not the country where she spends most of her life ! In the U.S. she remains a second-class citizen (immigration status, skin color, wealth, Language,,,). She belongs to some sub-group, but not upper-middle class.

Aha: it's your social strata within each country, that determine which country you prefer. You can call it exclub, FOLB or peer comparison.

Since Sep/Oct I feel my carefree ezlife is diminishing/declining/// in some strange way. It takes effort to explain it

The DIYHI created lots of conflicts, self-blame, zsms about tcost, involution.

Then in Nov, kids' math exam results ..

Then in Mar 2023, EDyw was a real blow according to the rmSelf, but for the xpSelf, Edyw didn't /knock me out/ of my carefree zone.

In the grand scheme of things, these pains/unhappy episodes would pass.
The "carefree" felt so short-lived to the rmSelf, but (to the xpSelf) it soon returned.
