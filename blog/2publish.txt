-- new: unnecessary urgency
My current GTD speed would be frowned upon in Stirt, GS or Barcap.

As Alan Shi pointed out, most of the effort actually went to waste in those ibank tech departments.

Mvea, RTS, OC teams .. are somewhat better. MLP is generally more relaxed.

-- new: CIV hands-down win/loss: unbalanced reactions
today I helped Sachin on Q2 of a python CIV by a crypto shop, where he and another Mr Mysterious couldn't pass all tests. I immediately dismissed my success as my luck rather than skill.

In reality, the test criteria is completely fair and clearly documented, so my code is actually better and and my coding skill (by definition) stronger.

My quick automatic self-dismissal, self-devaluation, self-brush-aside is blatant and completely unbalanced:

* when I win hands-down (about 30% of the head-to-head contests) I always dismiss it.
* when I lose hands-down (about 30% of the head-to-head contests) I label myself with many labels -- poisonous labels.

Perhaps the other team (Alina and her friend) doesn't understand the question. Perhaps the other team didn't design correct. It was not an easy careless mistake since they looked very hard for an explanation.

NoSql is bigData, not DS/ML. 

Data Science probably favors python or R. ML is even less suitable for java.
ML includes classification, recommendation, ,, NeuralNetwork is part of ML

-- new: 2022 review: techBets, TSN
Most of my past techBets and tsn ... are likely to pay lower dividends after first 10Y. 
Strategic orgro is a holy grail.
I will receive the dividend when I change job  back to .. bondMath, mkt data, sockets, SQL or Perl, 

We all have to be discretionary, cautious in our positioning.
I spend lots of time blgg about this.
Despite the underwhelming results of my techBets and tsn, we must not give up.
Applicable to Singapore government too. 
We need to decide what tech to take up and what to put off.

For the last 15Y, finDev IV is my chose game.
The 3 types of dnlg are still relevant.

After 55, we should leave cpf oa balance as is. It grows at 2.5%pa, better than bank deposits in liquidity or return.

any time after 55, I can incrementally withdraw most of my cpfOA ... to invest or spend.

The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another.
