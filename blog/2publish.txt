--new jolt: math coaching: focus@ %%own ROTI
In my parenting effort, if I don't focus on my current roti, I would eventually feel the pain. Analog: if you don't monitor your calorie/burn rate, you will eventually suffer/experience the cummulative effect.

If some coaching effort is not effective (usually losing my cool), then stop it early enough, even if boy is suffering in numerous ways, even if I look like a quitter...
Basically, I can waste more time by trying to "help" him.

jolt: my deep (vague) disappointment with my renzi effort was largely due to the worldly, materialistic "progress". 
No progress, then i feel time wasted. That's materialistic and impatience.
