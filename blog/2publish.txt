-- new: English as a common working language]SG 
English is needed as a common working language in Singapore (also U.S.)
There's a need to balance two needs

* All of these governments recognize immigrants' right to speak their original language when living in Singapore. Original language is well-recognized as more effective esp. as the immigrant copes with numerous challenges in a new place. Singapore is not the easiest new country for an immigrant.
* The requirement for basic English skill at the workplace + schools. The pressure to learn English may push some of these immigrants to reduce original language usage, as a strategy to speed up English learning.

So at the minimum, SG immigration (and job interviewers) require each immigrant to be "effective" in listening and reading, and also expressing themselves clearly in the common language. 

In reality, many China immigrants (my younger self) struggle and experience some level of disadvantage/handicap in English-dominant places of Singapore.

These glamorous women each chose a man "lower" in wealth and power. In a way, such a glamorous woman has made enough money and doesn't need more money. She does need equality in marriage.

Once they commit to a marriage, they become extremely vulnerable. They would have a marriage to protect. They may have kids to protect. Statistically, marriage failure within her circle was higher than average, perhaps 30%. 

The power, wealth, good looks.. on the opposite side is a hazard.

In fact, many of them didn't marry someone older, because an older man attracted to a young glamorous woman can easily get seduced by an even younger woman

Therefore, these glamorous women were shrewd. They know their priority, their weaknesses, their risks.

-- new: speak slowly when..
when speaking to someone new
when speaking on the phone rather than face to face
when spaking about something sensitive or important
when nervous.
when in front of many people

.. no one speaks too slowly. Most peopel including me speak too fast.

If you have a tendency to stutter, then slow speaking can reduce it. If not eliminated, then slow speaking with stutter is a kind of unique personal style. It's not perfect but it can be disarming and earn you trust.

I heard a departing colleague's truthful reflections including the reasons for the departure. One of the reasons is related to comp benchmark. I guess (with good level of confidence) that he feels that given his value-add and effort, he should receive $XX more (whatever XX is).

The more one dwells on it, the more one would feel unfair -- Someone else in the same team has the same level of value-add but was rewarded much more.

It's a valuable protection that I don't put in extra effort and sacrifice for the manager. It protects me from the hazard of harmful comparision. If you don't compare, you feel satisfied. If you do, your bubble bursts and derails.

At my age, I don't salary-benchmark as much as in my 30s -- I don't care so much about wasting my potential, my spare capacity. It's good and bad. 

It's bad if I am chronically underpaid (20% below market) like J.Zhang.
It's good if my employer and my manager is generous and keen to retain older SWEs like me.
