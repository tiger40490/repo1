-- new: OC bond mufu
Why the OC mufu is not something to buy-n-hold?
One reason is expRatio. Is there some long-term trend? I don't see it.

Shall we ask some OC senior advisor?

-- update bpost on proliferation
.. My adaptations to the proliferation problem:
more deletion of outdated bposts
git blogging now uses more Update less New
more time spent on fuxi using PubDate adjustment and less time spent creating new bposts
more comments in bpost titles.. In some cases, post title, tag/category are more impotant than the (brief) post content
"fuxi" entries in git blog .. see bpost
