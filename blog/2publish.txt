--update blogpost on 3 likely derailers of current carefree easy life
My current carefree phase has lasted more than a year since late 2018. 

Q: what are the derailers observed so far, based on facts, not forecasts not sentiments?
A: The only brief derailers were ah-boy's math weakness and the lockdown pains. In terms of sentiments I worried briefly about PIP

Some major derailers are hard to foresee. How about
* family harmony disrupted
* something broken at home
* something lost
* conflicts with colleagues
* medical conditions
* injuries
* accidents
