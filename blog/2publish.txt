Call CGC to find out his surname

Grades? "Let him fail"
adverse reaction -> conflict? "Call police"
adverse reaction -> threats? No comment from doctor. I would say ... Anticipate; Keep cool and breathe
screen time? "Try FSC psychologist"
self-esteem? "Try psychologist, not psychiatrist"
Sleep? CGC can't help much
"Yixin is a good boy" .. doctor concluded in parting

SG extraterritorial penalty on drug usage is a deterrent for my kids. 
Can be a valuable restraint and deterrent.

-- new: BMI: height measurement noise
k_celebrate_every_small_good_news

Measurement noise (affects BMI) should NOT be 3cm. An Outram polyclinic doctor confirmed that my height was 176cm, so 1.73 or 1.74 would be a mismeasurement.

As we age, we will shrink, but until then, we should celebrate this "1 cm" and other small improvements.

Without tiptoeing, stand as straight as possible to maximize measurement. You can look up or down. Micro adjustment can yield 1 cm

-- new: jupyter
A notebook file is a (non-ascii) document Produced_By the jupyterApp. It contains py code + rich-text input/output

The jupyterApp is a server-client application that allows editing and "running" notebook files via a standard browser-as-client. Server instance can run in a laptop or in the cloud.

I believe the notebook file is "served" from the server.

Custom python function definitions and imports often need to go into a cell.

Each Cell in a notebook file can run by itself independently from other cells. It can reference results or functions from another cell. That's why slow data loaders need to run once (in their own cells) and be available to other cells.

https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/architecture/content-architecture.html has an architecture diagram for "notebook interface"

-- new: c++nlg graph for QQ JIV
Some c++ candidates study a chapter on some deep topic and feel "I know everything about this topic". Invariably, when an interviewer drills in deeper, their one-chapter knowledge would be exhausted.  I used to feel "Hey, I must study 5 times more to understand deeper". Now I am different.

* If interviewer is really hardcore, he might drill in beyond my 5x knowledge and see the limit of my knowledge, so I'm no better than those candidates.
* if interviewer is mid-way in-depth, then I could differentiate myself from those candidates.
* if interviewer has a long list of easy questions, then both me and those candidates would pass.

The key -- what level of depth is expected of me?

One advantage of my approach is knowledge graph .. where incrementally I connect the dots and deepen my understanding.

Sugg: read widely and quickly, refresh and expand the knowledge graph.

If a pull request branch can't be rebased onto master, sometimes it can be squash-merged.

For c++
#1 is C
#2 is Simula

For C, the #1 is the B language. It explains the naming of "C"

-- new: ##minor criticisms of c++: for JIV
An obscure but simple shortcoming of c++ lies in the iostream. There is a shared mutable global state in the global variables cout (and cerr). Every call to setXXX would permanently update the global state until updated again.

iterator invalidation .. a common gotcha
