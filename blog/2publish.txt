See also dissatisfaction blackholes

Many items are optimization issues [improving from merely "acceptable" to more optimal]

BMI
sleep timing not improving
risk capital increment still too slow? Not a dissatisfaction
too many movies? Not a dissatisfaction. This is much better than that "home movie" situation
not standing enough? Still 1-2H a day though my intuition tells me "insufficient".

Remember the story "Complain less about your shoes. Look at those missing a foot." But what if you lose your foot? 

It's a double-edged sword to compare with the less fortunate in order to feel less unlucky.

-- update post on EP holders... which post?
SG has limited natural resources, similar to Japan.. must maximize and compete on human capital, but the local population human capital is also limited.

Fin-IT is one HVA [high value-add] sector. Most of the qualified individuals are foreigners including Indians and Chinese. Citizens like me are perhaps 2-5% of the talent pool.

The HVA sectors often need talents that are lacking in the local population. Therefore, SG needs to import foreign talents to jump start those growth engines, and hope to get more locals trained in those HVA sectors.

Many of my Fin-IT foreign colleagues really like SG and want to stay here forever. If one of the foreign talens have kids growing up in SG, government hopes these kids mingle with local kids and become naturalized Singaporeans.

These same individuals often migrate to U.S., Australia, Canada, or return to home countries. Therefore, SG is engaged in a global competition for talents and their genes. 

I am one of the well-naturalized foreign talents.

How about HK in comparison?

After 55, we should leave cpf oa balance as is. It grows at 2.5%pa, better than bank deposits in liquidity or return.

any time after 55, I can incrementally withdraw most of my cpfOA ... to invest or spend.
