--new: evaporated milk
For a creamy taste without the cream, try evaporated (canned) milk! Evaporated milk is made by removing water from fresh milk and then heating it. Heating the milk gives it the creamy, slightly cooked taste and darker colour

More dense than fresh milk, but there are low-fat versions.

--new: more spare time can "buy" me
See also plowback

Note spare time includes leaves

More spare time can but me:
lower-body flexibility
cardio fitness
more therapeutic, reflective blogging

However, limiting factor is not only spare time (like O2) but absorbency
inufficient absorbency for localSys
inufficient absorbency for jogging, stretch
inufficient absorbency for coding drill

Jolt: Before I scold ah-boy about his absorbency deficiency, look in the mirror.

--new jolt: math coaching: focus@ %%own ROTI
In my parenting effort, if I don't focus on my current roti, I would eventually feel the pain. Analog: if you don't monitor your calorie/burn rate, you will eventually suffer/experience the cummulative effect.

If some coaching effort is not effective (usually losing my cool), then stop it early enough, even if boy is suffering in numerous ways, even if I look like a quitter...
Basically, I can waste more time by trying to "help" him.

jolt: my deep (vague) disappointment with my renzi effort was largely due to the worldly, materialistic "progress". 
No progress, then i feel time wasted. That's materialistic and impatience.

Janus Henderson research said “At some point though, borrowing to pay the dividend is not sustainable.... Nobody wants to be the CEO who cuts the dividend. They understand that any company that cuts, its shareholders will flow into competitors and be very, very hesitant to ever come back.”

Shell, Chevron Corp., and Total may also choose to save money for dividends by reducing their share-buyback programs, which are typically seen by investors as more discretionary than the quarterly cash payouts.

GS research said “In past oil downturns, Big Oil on aggregate did not respond to challenging macro conditions through material dividend cuts,”

--new: in mid March 2020, I visited swimming pool and couldn't help comparing with my last bachelor phase around age 31, when I developed weekly swimming routine.
At that time I didn't know any way to earn more than 5k
I didn't know my killer talent at theoretical QQ topics like low-level, math, concurrency principles
I didn't have a dev-till-40 plan (let alone 70) or the associated security in family livelihood.
i didn't have the nonwork income sources
I didn't have UChicago brand
