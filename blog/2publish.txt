--new: theoretical min burn rate during retirement
Conceptually, excluding accommodation, bare-bones monthly burn rate would be 50% allocated to food. I would guess roughly SGD 500 out of SGD 1k.

food + public transport + public utilities would be 70% of that burn rate.

The wildcard is healthcare. In Singapore, outpatient cost might be $50-$100/month

Across developed countries, food cost is rather low relative to income, and possibly falling if we aim at the "basic healthy" level. Public transport and utilities are subsidized because 50% of the households can't afford higher rate on these essentials.

CNY eve steamboat in hindsight
:) very very low starch and fried food, against temptation of wrong-food
:) removed all visible fat
:) no drinks
:) lots of veg + tofu for fill-up. Even more fruits
:) threw away jelly leftover by boy

lots of beef, pork and fish. In hindsight, slightly too much beef. Luckily grandma stopped me.

--update blogpost on nuts
many fancy nuts are
* expensive, much more than peanuts
* have reported health benefits like fiber, heart-healthy fats, just like peanuts
* exotic taste compared to peanuts
* have reported low harm in terms of weight gain, unless you binge. 
Few consumers binge on these fancy nuts because ... expensive!

As such, these are luxury equivalents of the ordinary peanuts, but they are marketed as very special and "healthy" superfoods.

Fact: thanks to globalization, food and clothing cost is reducing world wide, so is the minimum cost of living, at least in SG.

Q: but why is our monthly burn rate not reducing?
A: I would say as a bachelor, my burn rate is probably lower than before, but as a family, we all want the same level of "pleasure" as our neighbors. We FEEL impoverished and deprived if we only consume at the same level as 10Y ago (which has become cheaper than 10Y ago)

This question has implications on FIRE and bare-bones ffree.

Wife, as a mainstream consumer, wants to feel "affordable" when considering certain everyday "lifestyle" spend like a toy, personal care, home fixture, fancy food... 
If her friends can afford something, but I tell her "not necessary", she would feel deprived.
To me these "lifestyle" items are all unnecessary, but I'm no purist myself .... 

At my abstinence level, projected family burn rate is SGD 2k. In contrast, at wife's spending level, it is probably 6k, due to
* travel and dining
* personal items

She wants freedom to spend any way she wants, without asking for approval.

I kind of believe I can be truly *comfortable* at, say, 4k burn rate (excluding housing + major medical + college tuition), but for her, the 'comfortable' level is possibly 8k. The ERE author is much lower.
