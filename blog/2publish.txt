--new: Q: what I want boy to gain from this crazy SG math program@@
* word problem-solving techniques? No. Too contrived and not needed in u.s. high school(?) or in adult life
* arithmetic proficiency. Note ratios and decimal point shift don't need calculator
* absorbency and perseverance to applying his mind and recall what he learned before?
* not giving up? I doubt he can learn this skill better in the SG system than in U.S.
* self-discipline and perseverance? I doubt it.

--new blogpost: I have a problem seeing dabao having fun
I think I have a problem seeing him having fun. I hate to see him enjoying the fun without doing his part.

Both parents probably feel he is too fun-loving. I feel he doesn’t want to earn the right to have fun.

Grandpa felt it’s normal.

For non-word problems, I think i should support perseverance.

For word problems, tough choice for me.
I feel encouraging him to solve tougher word problems sounds like 拔苗助长

I kinda see Ms Goh's view. Boy is not trying enough, and relying on other people to do the thinking for him.

Perseverance (willpower) is questionable practice and often fails in many cases. In this case, teacher is very sure and wife also believes it.

My arithmetic drill is doable and requires perseverance; Probably ditto for the easy word problems (some at P3/P4 levels);
Some word problems that require equation .. he has no confidence so perseverance is possibly ineffective.

fatigue and 厌学?

confrontation, strain, losing-cool

key to perseverance -- 温和

compare the P1 spelling experiences -- 3 hours to learn 10 words. I tried teaching him the patterns but completely failed as he was not engaged.

compare the piano perseverance.

邓丽君 was weak in math as a pupil but showed perseverance.

.. perseverance4boy #yoga as personal experience
am not good at yoga, but I make a serious effort trying.
I guess relatively few people are like me. Karma

I guess for my son the math practice feels like yoga to some extent??

--new: t-spillage]workout
eg: 10 min actual swim takes 30 min in the water, and at least 1 hour total due to commute + shower etc
eg: 50 min yoga class requires about 3H including wind-down.

For these workouts, if you try to reduce the 'spillage' you may hit a stonewall.

eg: jogging has much lower spillage
eg: mini-workout has the lowest spillage

I used to undervalue the Roti of workout
Now I feel prioritizing workout (over other t-spend) means accepting the spillage
