--new jolt low-energy@work projects
t_intro
I now feel low-energy (low-absorbency is a second descriptor) on work projects. However, at the same time I often feel high-absorbency on workout (or diet), QQ (or coding drill), parenting,,,

These other absorbency domains are arguably more strategic, so the current situation as described is actually better than the "average" situation which features an absence of absorbency on any front whatsoever.

Is it possible to have high-absorbency on all fronts? Unlikely. Therefore, recognize your priorities, embrace the imperfect self, and celebrate the improved-imperfection. Everyday is imperfect anyway.

--new: y smart ptr popular in c++IV
I think even if a hiring team doesn't use smart ptr (for that matter, TMP, threading,,), they would drill into this topic as it is a good probe on big4

--new: throw: always explicit in c++
t_clarify
in java, a Throwable object can come from some invisible code, perhaps in the jvm implementation code.

In c++ a catch clause always catches something explicitly thrown by a c++ code module, almost never something from a C library. 

However, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28925878/do-c-standard-library-functions-which-are-included-in-c-throw-exception shows some corner case of undefined behavior in a strcpy(). In such a case, the c++ compiler can do anything such as throwing exception.

Note C functions like strcpy() doesn't throw because C doesn't support exceptions, but c++ compiler is permitted to and does generate throwing code in some corner cases.

jGC knowledge is high-churn. The insight and halo you build loses value over 10 years.

--new: overpriced market: homeOwnership, sdxq...
jolt, t_uniBrand
In overpriced markets like Beijing, rental is relatively underpriced and represents a real bargain, but the Chinese doesn't perceive the bargin in a positive light, due to a deep preference for ownership, as an essential basis of security, achievement, social status

How about sdxq homes? Poor bargain in terms of rental demand and commute

How about Ivy League colleges and UChicago? Poor bargain, according to Kyle.

In these cases, mainstream preference is not an accurate reflection of the correct priority in my situation. It's crucial to honor my own preference (and wife's) rather than other people's preferences.

--update blogpost on success
my dad is the very best in his field, but he knows his influence is not so wide, his value not so great, his legacy will not last very long.

In comparison, I have reached ffree fairly early, in my late 20's when I quite my full time job. Reached again after overseas rental started in my early 40's as described to Kyle. Then the mvea and mlp jobs became carefree, and my SGD non-CPF brbr increased way past 2.0.

Am i more successful than him? No simple conclusion.. depends on what your priorities and goals. See my blogpost on success.
