--update blogpost on config data
executables must be in binary, unreadable format, but config can be text files. I think in unix tradition, they are all text files, but not in windows.
--update on sinks:
piano, workout ... serve as sinks that I can suspend when spare time becomes scarce.

workout has given way to piano because ... payment!

--update
spending excessive hours (often poorly defined) on winup or the windows license expiration is worse than accepting nagging popup reminders.

Life is never perfect, esp. with these new technologies and devices.

--update blogpost on cancer stress
anger is another type of stress, and growing. Anger often comes with loss of control.

boy's shout on 28 Nov night: 10 times

If dad leaves urine on floor, 10 times the penalty cash to mom or grandma
--update blogpost on burn
materialistic roti + absorbency

In a way, burn often focuses on the non-urgent-but-important quardrant, the tough jobs that deserve lots of sunshine.

--update blogpost on review
We spend half the time on improvement ideas for the team + my view of the SG teammates + my son. 
I think we only spend 10-15 min on my review, all positive.

How can I secure and further strengthen my position?
* more familiarity with the numerous conventions among the individual adapters
* more familiarity with mi_epa
* nautilus? LGlp
* IMPACT? LGlp
* futures epa would be considered the next level for me

--new: windows scheduled script to clean up Download folders.
Use bat file, or bash or perl (strawberry)
check in the script
maintain individual scripts for each machine. 

tbudget 5-10H. Patience needed. Most people seem to be the uncommitted hare rather than the slow but committed tortoise. MengZi compared crabs vs earthworms

a lot of effort is on dealing with windows permissions.

--new: 70mile/day role model@@ No
See also my blotposts on coding drill
The "role model" of the guy who ran 70 miles on his 70th birthday has a negative impact on me. Not a helpful role model at all.

It made me feel worthless, weak, guilty ... even though I'm stronger, more determined than most people.

--new: at my age, how important is investment analysis
I told  Rebecca that investment analysis is an obsession among some friends I met recently. I think our analysis on big investment decisions (200k+) is legit.

I think my biggest tcosts and worst ROTI was in stock/FSM. 

I told Rebecca that health and career longevitiy (job security) are more important.
I guess the underlying message was -- my wealth planning job is basically done. Note "wealth" can be a modest amount. like 50k

In reponse to my bold claims, Rebecca pointed out most of the spare cash can (had better be) invested, not "left in the bank account" earning 2%

I feel the classic example is Kun.h. He seems to overanalyze until he couldn't take any action.

--new: merge pre-processing loop into main loop@@
Q: can we remove pre-processing loop and merge its logic into the main loop?

No. My experience shows that it's often a good practice to separate out that initial processing. After that initial loop, we have a checkpoint/milestone where we can use asserts and prints to verify a number of key assumptions or pre-conditions. This checkpoint can yield huge benefit in reduction of uncertainties.

This preprocessing step seems to introduce additional complexity but it's not additional, but rather shifts some amount of complexities from the main loop out to the preprocessing loop.

This is similar to my long-time preference of shifting complex logic from main java app to DB (including stored proc) and to client-side such as java script. 

Some people call it separation of concern. In this case, the job responsibility of the pre-processing loop is well-defined and easy to verify.

--new: socket API is not designed for microsecond response to signals
I think signals are popular and proven tools to socket programmers.

When a signal is sent to a socket program, the response is not within a few clock cycles. I think the receiving program must notice it and react to it.  

I think if faster response is required, then the "event" should be delivered via the socket itself. The proogram would pick it up synchronously. 

--update blogpost on java=outlier
These are tech fads in my experience, but can someone live on this tech till retirement, like the technical writers?
C#, WPF
perl
stored proc
mysql
php
apache, DNS
LotusNotes apps for Raymond

Was I lucky? I was lucky only with coreJava !
I had my share of unluckiness.

I feel by 2030 java bigData will go out of fashion just like java Generics, Hibernate, functional java, streams API, .

-- new: respect not tied2benchmarking
Nothing much new, but a useful revision.

I told a Cigna counsellor, what's really important to my job satisfaction is respect, but the elephant in the room ... is benchmarking.

GS is the most direct experience. Respect from manager, peers, users and even self-respect is mostly based on benchmarking within your own team, and within the bigger department.
My ErrorMemos user in Texas gave me exceed, perhaps based on his past experience with other developers. Yet my manager found me nothing spectacular.

Users and External peers and users may not know what the other team members are able to achieve *if put in my shoes* so no benchmark per se. Yet these evaluators have an expectation and based on it, a level of respect to you

.. Among performing artists (and visual, literal artists), some artists are loved by their audience, but Question: what about the ranking? 
My answer: the ranking doesn't matter to their audience. If I'm an audience of a particular writer, composer, singer ... then I see unique value in her, regardless of the ranking chart.

.. students in general
My kids don't need to be outstanding to learn useful things and have a meaningful experience in school
Excellence is measured on personal growth. This is within the student's circle of control.

.. researchers like my dad

.. my piano practice and yoga .. is a different form of "respect". I exceed my limitations and my inertia and I derive various benefits, all without benchmarking.

-- new: technology churn on WallSt^internet
my perception of churn has been fundamentally shaped by two phases in my professional experiences -- pre-2007 internet career in SG and post-2007 WallSt career in US/SG.

The technologies in the internet space has faster churn. 

A big chunk of WallSt infrastructure is browser-based, intranet or internet. They experience similiar level of churn. Jxee is affected. Remember PWM servlet-based framework?

Another chunk of WallSt infrastructure is low churn, including coreJava, c++, SQL, MOM, FIX, sockets, batch jobs

By the way, Linux is dominant on WallSt and in the broader internet ecosystem.

UI technology is usually high-churn. Increasingly browser-based.

-- new or fuxi: wind-down tcost: to be embraced
Opening eg: In Bayonne, after every yoga+pull-up workout, I would spend about 2 hours shopping to wind down. It's a kind of reward, so that the prospect of the next session is not so off-putting. 

The wind-down is a necessary tcost, due to human nature. I don't think there's any superhuman, not in my dad, in Wenqiang, in Rahul. 

In a way, this wind-down is comparable to sleep. Sleep is not a waste of precious time. Sleep is a positive element our human life. 

The wind-down is a replenishment/recharge/recuperation and should be seen in a positive light.

If the wind-down is enjoyable, then be grateful.

.. speed coding exercise .. is very taxing, depleting my reserve. 
.. QQ learning is more enjoyable than speed coding exercise and require less wind-down.
.. my son's green zone.. 

--new: robux spend
I spent money on robux to reduce his gaming time, but is it working?
Need a critical, open discussion with boy.

If not "reducing" then I feel this is like timezone -- spending money to give him the reward that he really appreciates.
