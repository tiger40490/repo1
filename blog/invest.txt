--ask Susan about rental occupancy.
Also ask about psf price

--find out IRAS policy on overseas rental income

--new: concentration risk in Cambodia
in defense of a 4th Cambodia shop, a typical single  property investment in China, U.S. or Singapore is about SGD1000k, but 4 shops combine to about SGD500k

--new: burnRate^rentalSpread for XR]SG
I can explain to XR that his ex-housing burn rate in SG would be $6k and his rental spread across U.S./SG would be USD 2.5k but he would lack confidence in these far-fetched estimates.

My confidence stems from my expense tracking, blogging/analysis, discussions

--new: ##derailers@current ffree "easy life"
My ffree "easy life" would become tough if I face PIP.

If no PIP, then job search obstacles (Re Deepak, CSY, Pinsky, XR) would be the next biggest headache. I would feel trapped and unwanted.

If no such obstacle, then kids' grades would be the next headache.

In contrast, I now believe long commute is actually not such a pain. I somehow got used to the Bayonne 3-segment commute.

Back to ffree state-of-mind... Can I feel comfortable about a SGD 2k burn rate? The more comfortable, the more confident.

--new: y U.S.investment product returns higher than SG
Remember the Allianz Income Protector and Energy12

I think it has to do with the stock market. Most investment products benchmark against the stock market. If a product's return is consistently way below stock market return, like average 4%, the product will not be launched, or will not survive. 

Another reason is income tax. Most of the investment returns would be taxed at 25% or higher. 

--wife still feels we need higher earning because we still feel the strain of parenting due to limited financial resources.

In the U.S. I would feel the strain of long commute.

Family will probably find our home small and old.

I could invest in renovation (comfort) rather than size (appreciation). 

--fuxi
I allow myself to feel superior about my burn rate and Fuller wealth, but I Donâ€™t want to fall into the trap of benchmarking with the high earners.

--fuxi: the BGC agency search is a valuable hard-lesson experience. I foresee I would have similar situations and requirements going forward.

--fuxi: Ashish's INR CD 
convert SGD->INR, invest for 1Y for 7%, convert back to SGD.
cost: bank FX spread
risk: FX ~ 2% a year
tcost is very low. Just transfer $1k to Ashish

--sugg: consider investing CPF-OA balance into U.S. 
Should be able to beat 2.5%
no guilt no hurry

* If recreational amount, then too much tcost.
* If 20k, then I need to convince myself to take the plunge. I would say that long term prospect is good.

--sugg: transfer some 1k from OA to SA just to live through it.
Ask CPF to compute the additional interest earned each year
Can do this during lunch break
