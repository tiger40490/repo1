-- fuxi: why I feel so effective, rewarding, satisfactory ... about my cash-flow, more so than wellness, work-life-balance, QQx, life-long learning...?

Reason: accumulation is more effective in family finance than the other areas
I have gravitated towards C and SQL precisely due to accumulation.

Reason: less monitoring or refresh needed. I have my exp recon routine + cash pile mgmt strategies. In contrast, wellness, tech learning ... require very high on-going effort.

Reason: my numerical analytical advantage is clearer in per-finance than most areas. QQ and coding drill are also similar.

-- new: entry/exit: stick to proven rule@@
t_critiq
I often hear authors advocate discipline -- "Set your own rules and follow them consistently." However, why do we need to monitor the market rather than program a computer to do so?

More importantly, how do I know when to (turn on override and) modify my rule?

I think in reality, what we can realistically do is "follow personal rules 95% of the time"

What percentage of retail investors have the descipline to achieve that? One in 10? Among these millions of investors, their numeric rules are all different and therefore create millions of "free agents" that power the free market.

-- new or update: personal system4stock-picking 
if you want to gradually develop a personal stock-picking "system", then you need to make a large number of small but real decision, over different times. A few big trades won't grow your confidence fast enough.

To become an experienced stock investor, you also need to make many informed decisions and learn from that experience.

Q: how much retrospective analysis needed?
A: not about how many hours but how much traction you gain (not wheel-spinning). You should cut down the review when you notice dimishing return.

Quick learning is an advantage of stock vis-a-vis other investments.

-- MOETF rebalance
Many high-yield bluechips should get higher allocation
concentration risk -- increase allocation on low concentration sectors
* consumer
* telco
* mining, usually international

Increase international stocks without heavy U.S. presence

Some sectors are interest-rate sensitive. Need to avoid topping up, but they have DYOC

-- update blogpost on (de)stressor..
buy-n-forget SP500_ETF relies on the index admin as stock pickers to adjust the portfolio

buy-n-forget a single stock doesn't involve exit-timing. Can rarely beat SP500_ETF.

Other ETFs, like sector ETF or other countries' ETF are usually less successful than SP500_ETF

--new: index investing relies on the index-admin as stock-picker
I think US index funds show far better returns than other regional indices. When we say mutual funds can't beat the index, we only mean the U.S. broad indices.

The admin of the indices are the real stock pickers and portfolio managers for those passive funds. 

-- new: few]%%cohort have a global branded degree
In their 20's, China was poorer than now, very few could get a scholarship to a branded college overseas, so they have to settle for a lower-tier.

After a certain age like 30, a low single-digit percentage would see enough justification for the high cost of a branded degree. 
Most of the Chinese peers already had a postgrad degree in their 20's. Hard to justify another postgrad degree. 

If they were unable to earn a branded degree, then I think that's one reason why so many of them have unrealistic evaluations of a branded degree.

-- update "branded car"
as I age, I see more and more similarities between branded college and branded clothing. The consumer here is the parent. Parents spend very large amount of disposable income on these status items.

-- new or update 
inflation (beyond CPI) is largely driven by exclub.
fancy food, branded clothing, residential property, luxury car, branded college ... 

As exclub demand increases, vendors increase prices. I think governments can't do much about this demand, except property cooling measures.

-- update SG inflation: 30Y personal xp #basket
Even U.S. inflation is not so bad in the short term. 

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/08/gold-as-an-inflation-hedge-history-suggests-otherwise.html says (The Federal Reserve tries to keep inflation around 2% per year.)

-- new: some retirees do worry about inflation eroding nest egg
https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/heres-an-option-to-protect-your-portfolio-from-inflation.html says Inflation is a top concern as investors fret about the rising cost of groceries, housing, gasoline and other living expenses.

Q: Is this widespread in the U.S. or Singapore?
A: I have limited insight. I would assume this is a top concern among some retirees in every country.

We can look at actual inflation. One of the biggest complaints of Chinese citizens is inflation in everyday purchases (excluding housing). SG is not bad as discussed in several blogposts. 

Q: is SGD 3k CRBR realistic? 
A: I still feel confident. 

==== new: Felicia discussion
Main topics: HDB purchase; eqMufu

-- I told Felicia I'm well-diversified but 
my concentration in property is rather high.
Bonds .. none. Bonds are a reliable, popular, useful asset class to consider. Remember the K.Hu discussion?
China .. not a lot of geographical allocation except the Beijing property. I think eqMufu is a reasonable idea.

-- Felicia thinks net rental yield of 3-4% is not very high. eqMufu can be better.
In the U.S. I should really favor MOETF. In SG, without converting my SGD, I should really consider more eqMufu.

With caution against 100% into eqMufu she pointed out that Diva has generated 10% annualized return since inception. This is the fund manager's claim, not her claim. She's very confident about DIVA, based on trec.

I believe SP500 would outperform most eqMufu over the next 50 years at least.

I believe since inception, probably 3 years out of every 10 had negative returns.
-- Felicia cautioned me .. HDB rental demand from foreigners could fluctuate in the long run. In the U.S. rental market, half the tenants are local Americans. There is therefore more risk in my HDB rental model
When I explained to her why I won't sell my HDB even while I'm settled in the US, I realized my deep bias and skyhigh confidence in the SG economy. Over the long term, my confidence would be put to the test.

Compared to China, U.S. and S.E.Asia, I still feel far more confident about SG HDB property.

Once I live through and understand U.S. rental property risks, I might conclude that SG is low maintenance but low yield.

-- ocbc mtg:
you can request HDB for valuation, but ocbc will concurrently do their own valuation, which can be faster.

as soon as you sign otp, you can send otp + myInfo (salary slip unneeded) to ocbc. L@Offer is available within a week "definitely", perhaps before the hdb valuation is available.

bridging loan interest is higher than mtg rate.

SORA mtg rate is likely lower than SIBOR rate. 

Board rate, SORA .. all need you to keep outstanding amount above 50% (of original) within first 2 years. However, given how low the mtg rate is, you could invest to earn higher rate.

-- update blogpost on Maslow
My T_defense collects many reflections of safety concerns

-- update livelihood blogs (S.Liu or Maslow)
[[Nomadland]] and many other movies and songs portray the livelihood pressures (even hardships) of ordinary people in relatively affluent locations by global standard. (For example, most Singaporeans would feel some livelihood pressure.) For them, my ezlife on the cash flow high ground is .. dream. 

I like mathematical criteria for that high ground, such as brbr, Fuller Wealth. By these criteria, my ezlife and my high ground are realistic for some of them, but they lack something to achieve the same.

-- new or update gold^U.S.eq^rEstate: long-term strength
gold offers inflation hedge only over the long term. 

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/08/gold-as-an-inflation-hedge-history-suggests-otherwise.html

"If you look at the very long term, gold should hold its value against inflation. But in any shorter period, it may or may not be a good hedge,"

Am sure there are multiple analyses on the limitation of gold as an inflation hedge.

--update Tianjue.Lin blogpost
In my younger days, I had to work hard over decades to improve my status for the mating competition.  When I first had kids, I didn't believe the likes of WQ.Luo. I was driven to improve housing, education resources... for my kids, engaging in the arms race with millions of other parents.

Simiarly, the inflation fear was a widespread brainwash.

Medical cost inflation fear was driven by my own parents...

All of these "struggles" are taught to every young men as part of Chinese enculuration.

Therefore, I felt perhaps $3M would be needed. Those around me who gave up on ffree were seen as _quitters_.

-- update "ffree is a state of mind"
What's the _real_ difference between me and my cohort in terms of ffree ?

I record/reconcile my burn rate over decades, and have high confidence in my forecast.
I have a reliable nonwork income in cpfLife and HDB rental, not counting other rental properties.
I say and feel I can stop working any time .. Statement 1
I say both parents can stop working indefinitely (and my family can live a reasonable, comfortable life) .. Statement 2. 
I sometimes say that I have more money than I need for my lifetime .. Statement 3. 
^^^ My circle of a few dozen friends never say these things. Am I serious? Yes. I didn't say what kind of family lifestyle Statement 2/3 entail. 

I often feel free to (and actually did) choose lower jobs. I don't think many in my cohort feel that same level of freedom.

I have no worries about medical, retirement income, long-term inflation. I think many of my cohort are not so care-free. These are big components of long-term ffree.

-- new: which middle-class aspiration ≠ LG2
t_cmcUS
t_sharpQ
So far, all the blogposts on this broad topic (..) have singled out aspirations that are non-consequential:

Branded college
SDXQ
Spacious home
Car ownership
..

Q: Is there one middle-class aspiration that I do subscribe to?
safe, conducive school? This is not just for middle-class
Safe, clean street? No. This is not just for middle-class

-- update blogpost on SG retirement location
I used to focus on d2stadium, d2lib. Now only d2mrt is important. In my older days, even d2mrt would be less important. Remote parts of SG is best.

-- fuxi: Singapore HDB locations
Yishun central HDB estate has nearly everything, but lower valuation mostly due to the affluent favoring d2city (how about Holland Village?). I guess Tampines, JurongEast are similar.

Bishan has worse d2city than TPY, but has better connectivity, library, jogging track.. In X years, I would not care about some of these factors.

-- fuxi: Jun.Z on SG condo
t_misperception
appreciation is slow in most locations. Don't believe agents who boast their appreciation potential.

Foreigner demand is dampened by ABSD, esp. in non-prime locations. These locations are mostly sold to local buyers.

-- fuxi: Jun.Z on cars
German cars are expensive if new, but cheaper than Japanese as a used car. He felt by design Japanese cars can go for many years after first 10Y.

So I had the misperception that German cars are designed better, stronger.

I think this is really a brainwash by my friends. 

I suspect there's a similar brainwash against wood houses.
