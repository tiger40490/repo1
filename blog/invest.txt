To improve my inflexibility about commute, am willing to accept a 5m cycling trip from home to the rail station.
This could help my wife's or kids' commutes.

Note my evening commute is much less stressful.

-- new or fuxi: boost MOETF DYOC
Right now, my diversification effort is not boosting aggregate DYOC

Should I cut some low-yield positions and top up on some high-yield stocks?

-- new: stocks are always high risk high return.
i think the stereotypical retail investors would consider stocks only for growth, not passive income. To them, a stock is either high return or nothing. They hear about dividend investors' stories, and also value-investing, but most of them decide to focus on high growth stocks.

Kun.H said "dividend is a secondary attraction/motivation." The main reason to consider any stock is invariably capital appreciation, hopefully a windfall. Kun is more intellectual and more analytical than other retail investors. His comments are articulate.Â 

Tian Jue said many investors have a reasonable, human desire beyond stable, dependable dividend. I guess it's a higher desire for ... windfall profit. I guess it's similar to higher desires like lottery, bigger home, top college,,,,, These higher desires drive up valuation to unreasonable levels.

Because these desires are based mostly on emotion, they can become irrational. Compare to Vallue investing.

Consider investing $500 into 25 growth stocks. To support firewall and buy-n-forget, I would need to limit each position to below $20.
Beware of the risk of temptation like tasty foods.

-- new: safe div stock: comparable to corp bonds
I now feel 4% DYOC stocks beat 6% high-yield bonds.

Granted the bonds guarantee the payment rate but look at credit quality, reliability and appreciation.

if a bond has 6% coupon rate, then credit risk and dependability is questionable

if a bond is relatively safe with, eg 4% coupon rate, then I would say a 3% DYOC stock would be quite possibly comparable quality.

In all cases, the stock has chance of appreciation/depreciation.

A 4% CDY aristocrat beats most of the bonds out there.

Last time was eq mufu. In hindsight, I didn't learn a lot. Actually, I was not able to. The mufu funds are almost opaque and rigid. I couldn't follow my views on individual companies.

Canadian stocks are not the only ones with withholding tax. Year-end 1099-DIV form has the most reliable data

Luckily, some (or all) the withholding taxes are recoverable if you file a US tax return.

-- update blogpost on food + transport = bulk of retirement burn rate
Roaming retirement in cheaper cities would reduce my food + transport 

-- update blogpost on inflation
perhaps https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/2020/08/08/inflation-discrediting-high-savings-ratebrbr/ or https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/2021/02/03/dbs-seminar-on-saving4retirement/

Most reputable authors from U.S., China, and other countries present inflation risk as one of the most serious risks for retirees. However, SG trec is much much better. However, my friend Tianjue disagrees...

-- fuxi: "diversity" in a neighborhood means "some concentration of my own ethnic group"

-- jolt: correlation of psf and d2mrt is not so clear. 
I think the count of interested buyers for each unit is very small, unlike gold.
We rarely have 2 identical units only different in terms of d2mrt, unlike commodities.
