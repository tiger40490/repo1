-- looking at the fancy new shops in the renovated funan mall (and the Suntec mall), again I realized none of the thousands of commercial offerings is necessary for a healthy, fulfilling life.

without the learning programs, kids can still grow well. Same can be said of MindChamps.

As to the "healthy" and fancy foods, you can have a good diet. In fact, by my standard, those foods are still too oily, sweet. Otherwise they won't be popular.

Work hard play hard .. Perhaps Rahul, my sis and many of the achievers would say that, but I am suspicious of the play-hard part. It often means spend hard, party hard. Inevitably, there's an exclub and FOMO element, but the benchmark used is vanity.

How about yoga classes? I do need helpl (esp. motivation) to sustain a yoga practice. That's my personal limitation. Therefore, the commercial offering is needed.

-- jolt: At my current income level,
* the running cost of dhost is negligible but I hate any negligent waste of money.
* DIY projects don't show significant cost saving but DIY is a life-enhancing, deeply satisfying experience

Besides, current income level is not yet enough assurance for financial livelihood. Therefore, I still feel the need to control burn rate. 

--SIA vs gold?
SIA is more likely to rise, but over long term, gold has proven its enduring value

--fuxi: in last Ikea meal, I criticized wife for a tiny $2.60 cheese tart (meimei didn't eat more than one bit), but I spent a much larger $16 on the lamb shank for boy
-- consolidate my "suggestions" to kondoko billing into one blogpost?
First tag the emails.
--fuxi:
After moving to Becky Ma's place at Boston beside Tuft's hospital, I predicted it would be the best rental home for us ever.

Now I predict that the current Hib19 carefree ezlife is the best ever, due to brbr and other things.

--fuxi: first state div advantage: Rebecca said this fund can hold long-term.
If I put in 10k and hold 20Y, then it's kinda reward for her work

--fuxi: again and again, I'm facing the same dilemma:
if each decision is 20k+, then risk of mistake feels unbearable.
If each decision is 1k-, then I feel the oth, obsession, .

Can we strike a balance? I think we may need to be confident.

.. case: properties
.. case: T:US: I think we can sink in large amounts like 3k due to my prev xp
.. case: SIA: due to the commission, I think we should commit 7k+ from SRS
.. case: divAdv fund. Thanks to my prev xp I think we can commit 5k, perhaps from SRS
.. case: gold: thanks to my extensive analysis and due to the large bid/ask spread, i think we can commit bigger amounts like 3K+
