in 2021 now I feel our conserver lifestyle is now upgrading

Do we need all of the modern fancy conveniences? Look at Nomadland

-- update blogpost on livelihood #S.Liu
Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a useful reference. 
Livelihood is mostly about the lower needs but education belongs higher, so is life-chances.

If we count only investment decisions, then all of mine are rEstate decisions

-- Singapore HDB locations
Yishun central HDB estate has nearly everything, but lower valuation mostly due to the affluent favoring d2city (how about Holland Village?). I guess Tampines, JurongEast are similar.

Bishan has worse d2city than TPY, but has better connectivity, library, jogging track.. In X years, I would not care about some of these factors.

-- MOETF rebalance
Many high-yield bluechips should get higher allocation
concentration risk -- increase allocation on low concentration sectors
* consumer
* telco
* mining, usually international

Increase international stocks without heavy U.S. presence

Some sectors are interest-rate sensitive. Need to avoid topping up, but they have DYOC

In my younger days, I had to work hard over decades to improve my status for the mating competition.  When I first had kids, I didn't believe the likes of WQ.Luo. I was driven to improve housing, education resources... for my kids, engaging in the arms race with millions of other parents.

Simiarly, the inflation fear was a widespread brainwash.

Medical cost inflation fear was driven by my own parents...

All of these "struggles" are taught to every young men as part of Chinese enculuration.

Therefore, I felt perhaps $3M would be needed. Those around me who gave up on ffree were seen as _quitters_.

-- update "ffree is a state of mind"
What's the real difference between me and my cohort in terms of ffree ?

I record/reconcile my burn rate over decades, and have high confidence in my forecast.
I have a reliable nonwork income in cpfLife and HDB rental, not counting other rental properties.
I say and feel I can stop working any time .. Statement 1
I say both parents can stop working indefinitely (and my family can live a reasonable, comfortable life) .. Statement 2. 
I sometimes say that I have more money than I need for my lifetime .. Statement 3. 
^^^ My circle of a few dozen friends never say these things. Am I serious? Yes. I didn't say what kind of family lifestyle Statement 2/3 entail. 

I often feel free to (and actually did) choose lower jobs. I don't think many in my cohort feel that same level of freedom.

I have no worries about medical, retirement income, long-term inflation. I think many of my cohort are not so care-free. These are big components of long-term ffree.

buy-n-forget SP500_ETF relies on the index admin as stock pickers to adjust the portfolio

buy-n-forget a single stock doesn't involve exit-timing. Can rarely beat SP500_ETF.

Other ETFs, like sector ETF or other countries' ETF are usually less successful than SP500_ETF

--new: index investing relies on the index-admin as stock-picker
I think US index funds show far better returns than other regional indices. When we say mutual funds can't beat the index, we only mean the U.S. broad indices.

The admin of the indices are the real stock pickers and portfolio managers for those passive funds. 

-- new: which aspiration â‰  LG2
t_cmcUS
So far, all the blogposts on this broad topic (..) have singled out aspirations that are non-consequential.

Branded college
SDXQ
Spacious home
Car ownership
..

Q: Is there one middle-class aspiration that I do subscribe to?
safe, conducive school? 
Safe, clean street? No. This is not just for middle-class

Canada is an attractive emigration destination due to healthcare. However, the Singapore integrated shield basically provides a comparable healthcare. 

-- new: CBDC=sovereign bccy
More than "pegged" it's identical to the fiat currency, issued by the same entity as the fiat currency
centralized
Unlike anonymous transactions as on public blockchains, transactions are tracked
speeds up cross-border payments including remittance. No middleman except the issuing central bank
can be used without internet
can be used without a bank account... I think the wallet is identified by the mobile number. I think mobile numbers are registered under a national ID. Note all such IDs are at the national level
unliked most bccy, a CBDC is legal tender, fully controlled by a central bank
For a particular consumer wallet, a CBDC balance is mostly stored on a smartphone, but can reside on a card (no connectivity required)
CBDC can use blockchain in a limited way. It may use its own private blockchain + distributed ledger. I feel such a blockchain is 10% similar to the BTC blockchain, and 90% similar to a traditional database

I used to focus on d2stadium, d2lib. Now only d2mrt is important. In my older days, even d2mrt would be less important
