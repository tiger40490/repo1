Top schools (in all countries), top colleges (esp. medical-school education), private tuition, enrichment programs... can be considered as luxuries that lower middle class (like me) can't afford easily. I would have to struggle, sacrifice, endure a lot to afford them

My barebones ffree is insufficient for this type of luxury.

Before college phase, I think luxury education could be 70% of the total budget. This luxury alone can derail my carefree life.

Similar experience -- the idea of a 700k home (with property tax + mortgage) became a threat to my cashflow carefree /position/, until I devised the lease-spread /idea/. 

-- consider putting USD 60k to FSM to earn higher interest, but tcost a bit too high?

--fuxi: income eq-funds: my take
I feel most of the big fund houses probably avoid the high-yield, high-risk stocks such as U.S. REITs.

I guess for them, 4% div is considered high. I assume the fund dividend payout comes strictly from stock dividend, not position liquidation. Therefore, a typical “high-income” equity fund can only pay 5% average. In reality it could swing between 3% and 7%

--fuxi: why I spend so much disposable time on personal finance, mostly ressearch and decision making? More than tech or wellness
Not completely irrational. There are rational reasons, perhaps subconscious.
