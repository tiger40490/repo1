-- new: t-spend on burn rate Control
need4reflect?
the time spent on burn rate control (including exp tracking) is rather high, perhaps higher than parenting analysis, QQ..
However, this t-spend is among the most practical, fruitful and time-honored.

I think most oridnary folks don't have my level of patience, interest, determination.

Remember that burn rate is among my top 5 unique strengths, my top 3 long-term livelihood shields, my top 5 cancer-stress relieves.. The huge value come at a high tCost.

* risky high-yield assets, like Energy12

dividend stocks? I have been thinking of 10k-100k allocation to T:US

Jill's products do not provide truly reliable current income. They are high-yield junk bonds.

gold?

-- jolt: At my current income level,
* the running cost of dhost is negligible but I hate any negligent waste of money.
* DIY projects don't show significant cost saving but DIY is a life-enhancing, deeply satisfying experience

Besides, current income level is not yet enough assurance for financial livelihood. Therefore, I still feel the need to control burn rate.

First tag the emails.

--fuxi: again and again, I'm facing the same dilemma:
if each decision is 20k+, then risk of mistake feels unbearable.
If each decision is 1k-, then I feel the oth, obsession, .

Can we strike a balance? I think we may need to be confident.

.. case: properties
.. case: T:US: I think we can sink in large amounts like 3k due to my prev xp
.. case: SIA: due to the commission, I think we should commit 7k+ from SRS
.. case: divAdv fund. Thanks to my prev xp I think we can commit 5k, perhaps from SRS
.. case: gold: thanks to my extensive analysis and due to the large bid/ask spread, i think we can commit bigger amounts like 3K+
