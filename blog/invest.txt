--fuxi: the BGC agency search is a valuable hard-lesson experience. I foresee I would have similar situations and requirements going forward.

xp: I actually lived without salary for 3 years and know my actual burn rate and lifestyle

--fuxi: jolt: I never think of the possibility that my chosen country of retirement could improve rather than decline
Q: Which country might outperform from a retiree's point of view, including healthcare, air/water, domestic helper cost, mobility ...
A: I feel SG is the favorite.

--new: (jolt)
I think many Australians feel Singapore is inferior as a retirement destination. I think they are rational. 

We don't have the years to try out various locations so we end up retiring in the 3 or 4 places we know, even though another destination may actually be a better choice.

In defence of this common practice, Perhaps it's not completely naive and irrational. Perhaps what's familiar and comfortable makes the best retirement destination.

--fuxi: Ashish's INR CD 
convert SGD->INR, invest for 1Y for 7%, convert back to SGD.
cost: bank FX spread
risk: FX ~ 2% a year
tcost is very low. Just transfer $1k to Ashish

--sugg: consider investing CPF-OA balance into U.S. 
Should be able to beat 2.5%
no guilt no hurry

* If recreational amount, then too much tcost.
* If 20k, then I need to convince myself to take the plunge. I would say that long term prospect is good.

--sugg: transfer some 1k from OA to SA just to live through it.
Ask CPF to compute the additional interest earned each year
Can do this during lunch break
