-- stocks are high risk high return.
i think the stereotypical retail investors would consider stocks only for growth, not passive income. To them, a stock is either high return or nothing. They hear about dividend investors' stories, and also value-investing, but most of them decide to focus on high growth stocks.

Kun.H said "dividend is a secondary attraction/motivation." The main reason to consider any stock is invariably capital appreciation, hopefully a windfall. Kun is more intellectual and more analytical than other retail investors. His comments are articulate.Â 

Tian Jue said many investors have a reasonable desire beyond stable, dependable dividend. I guess it's a higher desire for ... windfall profit. I guess it's similar to ..

Consider investing $500 into 25 growth stocks. To support firewall and buy-n-forget, I would need to limit each position to below $20.
Beware of the risk of temptation like tasty foods.

Last time was eq mufu. In hindsight, I didn't learn a lot. Actually, I was not able to. The mufu funds are almost opaque and rigid. I couldn't follow my views on individual companies. 

-- I guess ETFs mostly invest in popular stocks. 
The steady increase in ETF participation probably leads to more concentration more gravitation to the big index-component stocks. 
As ETFs become increasingly popular vis-a-vis stock-picking, the popular stocks probably receive even more mindshare and volume than before. 
These hot stocks probably become more volatile due to retail hot money.

I shun SG condos. I favor SEA emerging market rEstate.
I shun growth stocks. My dividend stocks are supposed to be mainstream among retirees, but my cohort are not retirees and I don't know anyone interested in my low-growth dividend stocks.
I favor a large number of often unknown stocks.
I shun new HDB flats.

I have repeatedly halved my mufu allocation. Mufu is probably more mainstream than stock-picking

t-spend on burn rate Control
is my monthly exp recon too time-consuming?

need4reflect?
the time spent on burn rate control (including exp recon) is rather high, perhaps higher than parenting analysis, QQ..
However, this t-spend is among the most practical, fruitful and time-honored.

I think most oridnary folks don't have my level of patience, interest, determination.

Remember that burn rate is among my top 5 unique strengths, my top 3 long-term livelihood shields, my top 5 cancer-stress relieves.. The huge value come at a high tCost.

-- jolt: correlation of psf and d2mrt is not so clear. 
I think the count of interested buyers for each unit is very small, unlike gold.
We rarely have 2 identical units only different in terms of d2mrt, unlike commodities.
