-- new: USD 100k warchest for rental relief
t_jolt

This amount means a lot to rental home comfort [size..]. $1k/M additional rental will exhaust this amount in 8 years !
This amount is insignificant for branded colleges .. not worthwhile
This amount is insignificant for a SDXQ home .. not worthwhile
This amount is easy to squirrel away, esp. in SG
To relieve work stress, I can realistic consider giving up $30k/Y salary over 10Y. USD 300k lost_pretax_income is no big deal. (After-tax, it would become a 200 lost income.)
This amount as a target bonus, is brutal and unforgiving. I won't accept such a target. I will reject such a target.

-- update blogpost on sitting in my driveway..
I feel the same about my foot massager, my back massager. The more you spend in terms of money and time, the heavier this pressure.

prolonged disuse can cause slow damage to some mechanical parts. 

Also, some spares parts may become hard to replace when they reach end of life defined by the manufacturer.

-- new: 5m cycling from home to rail station
To improve my commute flexibility, am willing to accept a 5m cycling trip from home to the rail station.

Note return trip is much less stressful.

Q: how serious is the weather factor? I have experienced 2.5 full years cycling in the U.S. No big deal.

-- new: Hoboken as rental home location
If I stay rented in Hoboken, I get excellent commute to NY and JC. I can cycle to JC.

Even though home price is possibly unaffordable, rent could be affordable, esp. further away from waterfront.

SDXQ is presumably better than Bayonne.

-- update blogpost on inflation
but which post?
Most reputable authors from U.S., China, and other countries present inflation risk as one of the most serious risks for retirees. However, SG trec is much much better.

-- update blogpost on retirement location and car-dependency
Many older folks should not be driving but can’t imagine life without a car. So you see many of them still driving everyday and you may be mislead to think it's OK. .. https://livingonthecheap.com/live-without-car/

https://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/getting-around/info-2015/older-adults-without-cars.html says
When older people have transportation options they can age in place and not depend on others to drive them everywhere.

-- new: buy old cars
If you plan to live car-lite, then it makes sense to buy a old car. I believe the depreciation is much slower.

Many peers would advise you to buy new, but they and me have different priorities. 

-- update car dependency
but which post?

The more "essential" commutes to office, to school, or to see family… tend to be periodic and scheduled, and… can be efficiently supported by mass transport systems like trains and buses

Reit management fee is higher than ETF, but not always disclosed.

-- new: Reit as part of lease spread
The more sunshine it gets, the faster this seed grows into a full plan.

As Brian@RTS pointed out, in most U.S. locations appreciation is insignificant. What if I grow a $300k Reit portfolio to generate 5% dividend [15k/Y] and remain a renter indefinitely?

Ignoring "external" rental incomes but considering sublease, what's my expected net rent outlay? $2k/M or $24k/Y. At 6% DYOC, a 400k Reit portfolio would take care of this outlay.

For the same amount, how does it compared to 43R or my Asia rental properties?

benefit: no lock-down to one location
benefit: incremental acquisition
benefit: diversification. Lower location-specific risk
benefit: liquidity
benefit: very low transaction fee when I buy or sell 
benefit: legwork and emotional costs of delinquency, repairs, vacancy .. is all factored into the DYOC. I am willing to pay the Reit operator to handle them.
drawback: no windfall appreciation
drawback: NRY (net) is probably much lower than 43R

-- new or fuxi: boost my DYOC
Right now, my diversification effort is not boosting aggregate DYOC

Should I cut some low-yield positions and top up on some high-yield stocks?

-- new: SG: higher GDP, lower wage after tax
t_paradox
SG has higher GDP-per-capita but lower after-tax salary than HK or U.S.

In terms of economics, I think it has to do with cost of living including rental and home price. 

In terms of personal experience, I feel slightly richer in Singapore than U.S. because of rental, med-bx, repairs (forecast), college cost (forecast)

"revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator." according to https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-life-lfc-great-value-165004399.html.

I think book value is also less manipulated including assets and liabilities.

Profits i.e. earnings, dividends are all easier to manipulate by accountants.

Overall, U.S. feels like a high-cost, moderate-tax, low-welfare country.

Beside Melvin3, there is high repair cost. 

Luckily, nutritition, bicycle, clothing, gadgets, repair tools ... are very affordable.

utility stocks including T:us need to pay high CDY as they are seen as low growth, which dampens investor demand

VZ is seen as higher growth

-- new: stocks are always high risk high return.
i think the stereotypical retail investors would consider stocks only for growth, not passive income. To them, a stock is either high return or nothing. They hear about dividend investors' stories, and also value-investing, but most of them decide to focus on high growth stocks.

Kun.H said "dividend is a secondary attraction/motivation." The main reason to consider any stock is invariably capital appreciation, hopefully a windfall. Kun is more intellectual and more analytical than other retail investors. His comments are articulate. 

Tian Jue said many investors have a reasonable, human desire beyond stable, dependable dividend. I guess it's a higher desire for ... windfall profit. I guess it's similar to higher desires like lottery, bigger home, top college,,,,, These higher desires drive up valuation to unreasonable levels.

Because these desires are based mostly on emotion, they can become irrational. Compare to Vallue investing.

Consider investing $500 into 25 growth stocks. To support firewall and buy-n-forget, I would need to limit each position to below $20.
Beware of the risk of temptation like tasty foods.

-- new HY stock^bonds
I now feel 4% DYOC stocks beat 6% high-yield bonds.

Granted the bonds guarantee the payment rate but look at credit quality, reliability and appreciation.

if a bond has 6% coupon rate, then credit risk and dependability is questionable

if a bond is relatively safe with, eg 4% coupon rate, then I would say a 3% DYOC stock would be quite possibly comparable quality.

In all cases, the stock has chance of appreciation/depreciation.

A 4% CDY aristocrat beats most of the bonds out there.

MOETF return is likely lower than Buffett, which is likely no better than sp500
Do I envy those with higher annual returns? Typically we are seeing BTC or growth stock investors.

buffett: better risk-adjusted return than sp500

-- update: I guess ETFs mostly invest in popular stocks. 
The steady increase in ETF participation probably leads to more concentration more gravitation to the big index-component stocks. 
As ETFs become increasingly popular vis-a-vis stock-picking, the popular stocks probably receive even more mindshare and volume than before. 
These hot stocks probably become more volatile due to retail hot money.

I shun SG condos. I favor SEA emerging market rEstate.
I shun growth stocks. My dividend stocks are supposed to be mainstream among retirees, but my cohort are not retirees and I don't know anyone interested in my low-growth dividend stocks.
I favor a large number of often unknown stocks.
I shun new HDB flats.

I have repeatedly halved my mufu allocation. Mufu is probably more mainstream than stock-picking

t-spend on burn rate Control
is my monthly exp recon too time-consuming?

need4reflect?
the time spent on burn rate control (including exp recon) is rather high, perhaps higher than parenting analysis, QQ..
However, this t-spend is among the most practical, fruitful and time-honored.

I think most oridnary folks don't have my level of patience, interest, determination.

Remember that burn rate is among my top 5 unique strengths, my top 3 long-term livelihood shields, my top 5 cancer-stress relieves.. The huge value come at a high tCost.

-- jolt: correlation of psf and d2mrt is not so clear. 
I think the count of interested buyers for each unit is very small, unlike gold.
We rarely have 2 identical units only different in terms of d2mrt, unlike commodities.
