t-spend on burn rate Control
jolt
is my monthly exp recon too time-consuming?

In terms of ROTI, monthly exp recon beats investment analysis in stocks and funds. 

need4reflect?
the time spent on burn rate control (including exp recon) is rather high, perhaps higher than parenting analysis, QQ..
However, this t-spend is among the most practical, fruitful and time-honored.

I think most oridnary folks don't have my level of patience, interest, determination.

Remember that burn rate is among my top 5 unique strengths, my top 3 long-term livelihood shields, my top 5 cancer-stress relieves.. The huge value come at a high tCost.

--no blog Q: shall I increase number of FSM holdings but keep each amount low?
I used to have that but then I sold most of them to simplify my life. They do become a distraction.

As recreation investing, they are less distractive than stocks.

also transfer most of the fund to FSM, but keep the multipler account as just another bank account.

-- correlation of psf and d2mrt is not so clear. 
I think the count of interested buyers for each unit is very small, unlike gold.
We rarely have 2 identical units only different in terms of d2mrt, unlike commodities.

-- financial health of wq.l
bought a 120sqm home for 750k. 30Y mtg, serviced entirely by CPF. When there's surplus CPF balance, they would pay down the mtg.

School costs are very low (until college). Kids' clothing cost is low accoring to him. The burden of parenting is mostly energy/time, not financial. This is stark contrast to the mainstream perception "raising one more kid in Singapore possibly costs more than a $1million."

A telltale sign of his strain -- WQ.l feels college cost would be much higher, even with the subsidies and student loans. Even before that phase, Tanko may say that unplanned events could derail their low-cost lifestyle for the next few years.

I think they are a frugal family. I think the mother has to go out and earn a salary.

No property investment. No tuition.


--update blogpost on brbr
barber's 压力 is presumably brbr. If they earn 2k and spend only $500, then no ground for complaint.

FOMO is probably another factor. The essential needs are probably $500/M
