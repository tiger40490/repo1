--no blog Q: shall I increase number of FSM holdings but keep each amount low?
I used to have that but then I sold most of them to simplify my life. They do become a distraction.

--fuxi: contingency cash reserve
How much is reasonable?
Park where? DBM multipler? No
FSM? 

-- fuxi or update
my analysis of a stock often hits dismal ROTI because I only buy up to $100

-- fuxi: Cambodia and BGC rEstate mkt: both driven by Chinese hot money
--fuxi: terminate dbs ccard 3M after confirming the end of multiplier bonus? Terminate to keep my life simpler.
also transfer most of the fund to FSM, but keep the multipler account as just another bank account.

-- tanko vs HF.Sun
I can tell both feel the pressure of livelihood (with/out kids). Both are suffering from workload, work stress, work life balance.

i feel tanko doesn't want to but feels pressured to work into old age, until he feels he has saved enough.
He doesn't believe in cpf-life providing sufficient cash payout for his golden years.

In contrast, I feel confident to stop working any time but I choose to work full time till my 70's and possibly part time till my 80's.

--new: Y few peers adopt my investment principles #Tanko
I told Tanko about my principles:

1) focus on cash payout rate around 6% as current income. I have a blogpost on 6% being the highest realistic return for long-term.
2) decent prospect of principal preservation over a 10Y horizon, worst case 20Y to recover 
3) Resist the temptation of windfall. Maintain a healthy detachment.

Note #2 is a personal conviction, because most of my chosen assets are actually illiquid without real time mark-to-market.

Q: why so few people in my age group follow similar principles. 
A(Tanko): many don't have enough free cash like 500k. 
A(Tanio): many investors prefer to see their 500k (if available) staying safe in a bank account, rather than fluctuating in an investment account.
A: I said a fundamental reason is that dividend yield is widely seen as insignificant compared to windfall.

-- new: t-spend on burn rate Control
jolt
is my monthly exp recon too time-consuming?

In terms of ROTI, monthly exp recon beats investment analysis in stocks and funds.

need4reflect?
the time spent on burn rate control (including exp recon) is rather high, perhaps higher than parenting analysis, QQ..
However, this t-spend is among the most practical, fruitful and time-honored.

I think most oridnary folks don't have my level of patience, interest, determination.

Remember that burn rate is among my top 5 unique strengths, my top 3 long-term livelihood shields, my top 5 cancer-stress relieves.. The huge value come at a high tCost.

-- financial health of wq.l
bought a 120sqm home for 750k. 30Y mtg, serviced entirely by CPF. When there's surplus CPF balance, they would pay down the mtg.

School costs are very low (until college). Kids' clothing cost is low accoring to him. The burden of parenting is mostly energy/time, not financial. This is stark contrast to the mainstream perception "raising one more kid in Singapore possibly costs more than a $1million."

A telltale sign of his strain -- WQ.l feels college cost would be much higher, even with the subsidies and student loans. Even before that phase, Tanko may say that unplanned events could derail their low-cost lifestyle for the next few years.

I think they are a frugal family. I think the mother has to go out and earn a salary.

No property investment. No tuition.

-- fuxi: the $8 spent in simlim earphone was an honest mistake. If we are too cautious about these spends, then we could become paranoid and too slow in our buying.

Changing to the adapter was a reasonable choice as it was not something unneeded, and I didn't know where to find cheaper versions.

-- fuxi jolt: even though I spent $10 on a new iPhone8 screen protector and it cracked around christmas, it was worth $10 simply because I didn't need to feel guilty about my smash. 
At a deeper level, the guilt was bigger than $10.

The christmas crack was not due to negative emotion, poor quality etc, so the $10 cost was easily accepted.

--fuxi or new: longevity health is ellusive but financial health, in contrast, can be strengthened. Key drivers are 1) higher current income and 2) burn rate control 3) maintain salary (a topic for another blog)

Buy more :
* risky high-yield assets, like Energy12
* safer low-yield assets
* risky low-yield high-growth assets, like SIA

dividend stocks? I have been thinking of 10k-100k allocation to T:US

Jill's products do not provide truly reliable current income. They are high-yield junk bonds.

Properties... no target. I should probably diversify to stocks

gold?

-- jolt: At my current income level,
* the running cost of dhost is negligible but I hate any negligent waste of money.
* DIY projects don't show significant cost saving but DIY is a life-enhancing, deeply satisfying experience

Besides, current income level is not yet enough assurance for financial livelihood. Therefore, I still feel the need to control burn rate. 

-- consolidate my "suggestions" to kondoko billing into one blogpost?
First tag the emails.

--fuxi: again and again, I'm facing the same dilemma:
if each decision is 20k+, then risk of mistake feels unbearable.
If each decision is 1k-, then I feel the oth, obsession, .

Can we strike a balance? I think we may need to be confident.

.. case: properties
.. case: T:US: I think we can sink in large amounts like 3k due to my prev xp
.. case: SIA: due to the commission, I think we should commit 7k+ from SRS
.. case: divAdv fund. Thanks to my prev xp I think we can commit 5k, perhaps from SRS
.. case: gold: thanks to my extensive analysis and due to the large bid/ask spread, i think we can commit bigger amounts like 3K+
