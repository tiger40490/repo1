--Q: our predicted burn rate with maid? 7k
saving rate target: 5k. Be kind to yourself. 

Both targets are useful and valuable. but we need different attitudes.

I'm generally competent at saving but stress can still happen

--fuxi: ocbc 
for ATM access, i will put my own money, not kid's money in this account.. Same as mayb. 
--fuxi: Q: what's the best use of additional 100k?
Some will actually spend it on fancy vacations
some will actually save it up to support top school districts or educational programs
I will consider
* lower-paying job with more satisfaction
* more time with grandparents
* vacations at nearby locations

Many fellow parents (plan to) spend so much on their kids because .. they want-to not pressured-to. Chinese parents feel good about martyrdom -- saving up and spending it on kids education. 

Labor of love... However, Some (33 to 50%) of my peers appear to be under pressure to spend such huge amounts, due to peer pressure and societal expectation like a "norm".

How am I different?
I don't plan to spend on branded college, so there's a 50/50 chance I won't start saving until 4Y before college
I don't want to spend on luxury vacations as an "education" -- unnecessary and too costly
I do consider taking lower jobs to spend more time with kids.
I plan to spend on kids' non-academic pursuits, as Jenny on swimming
