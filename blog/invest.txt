This analysis takes effort. Here's a modest start. I think without in-depth and comprehensive anslysis, my bare-bones ffree is naive and built on shaky ground.

country risk -- what if Cambodia or Philippines gets into trouble and property market collapses?

SG country risk -- what if medishield fails to deliver?

Currency risk -- suppose I'm retired in Singapore, and PHP or USD weakens

inflation risk -- Singapore is hopefully well-managed

credit risk -- CPF-based medical insurance 

for my bare-bones ffree set-up, One of the biggest uncertainties is predictability of in/out cash-flow . 
Every investment has uncertainties aka risks. 
Experienced investors often categorize dozens of known risks into some 5 categories. 
The grouping is mostly conceptual and arbitrary.

As Wallace Xu said, rental prop mgmt probably needs the owner to stay local and learn the legwork.

--new: ##eg@costly-unsatisfying
alcoholic drinks tend to be fancy
fresh foods
famous beef as the most expensive meat on the market
smart phone with fancy cameras
laptops with fast processors or huge memory
cinemas with leather seats 
dwellings with a sea view
limo with a drink table by the seat

--Ashish's INR CD 
convert SGD->INR, invest for 1Y for 7%, convert back to SGD.
cost: bank FX spread
risk: FX ~ 2% a year
tcost is very low. Just transfer $1k to Ashish

--consider investing CPF-OA balance into U.S. 
Should be able to beat 2.5%
no guilt no hurry

* If recreational amount, then too much tcost.
* If 20k, then I need to convince myself to take the plunge. I would say that long term prospect is good.

--sugg: transfer some 5k from OA to SA just to live through it.
Ask CPF to compute the additional interest earned each year
Can do this during lunch break
