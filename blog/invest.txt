--new: envious of U.S. superior income
I tend to look up towards U.S. and HK as high-income countries. Here's my critical assessment
* for tech professionals: Yes U.S. (not HK) is much higher than SG, but BR is also higher, so brbr is unclear.
* for WallSt techies: Yes U.S. and HK are higher-income than SG and many more jobs, but BR is higher. Brbr is probably inferior to SG.
* for main street: U.S. (not HK) is higher-income than SG, but BR is higher. Brbr is unclear.

cashflow stress is the biggest livelihood stress for most people. FIRE discussions reinforce this common notion. I think it is only slightly exaggerated, like by 0.1%

family harmony, wellness ... can become more serious stressors.

FOMO/kiasu/exclub/inferiority and waste-of-talent are common stressors but void

properties outperformed. Even without appreciation, the rental savings alone translates to at least 4% net return
my unit trusts -- probably 2-4%
Private equity -- I managed to recover from a big loss (Airtropolic), so barely positive return overall

A rigorous calc would include unrealized pnl from mark-to-market, ...

I have a blogpost on the highest returns achieved. I think it's in compound

--fuxi: FCF and big investments
Some higih-earning individuals are unable to buy a home. I think my ex-colleagues Damien, Pinsky might be among them. I imagine they don't give it priority. 

They could pay a high rent (up to 40% of their income), take a car loan to drive an expensive car, ... basically spend 99% of their salary every year. It's never hard to find ways to spend money.

Big investments don't necessarily require high brbr, but require savings i.e. FCF.

--fuxi: what FSM funds are suitable for wife's 5k portfolio?
high risk high return equity funds. US funds? but now might be a wrong time to go in.
SIA is better

-- fuxi or update blogpost on brbr?
Compared to 2016, my burn rate is down by 2-3k, partly due to pre-school, airfare, ...

Now i feel $1k to $2k reduction in burn rate means a lot to my (brbr and) sense of confidence, peaceful leisure, wealth. I think this reveals a fundamental difference between me and my peers.

Exclub wealth? Not enhanced by brbr improvement.
