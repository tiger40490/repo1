-- new: age 50 asset allocation 
more US stocks including indices, up to 10%
more international equity funds including ETF
more gold, up to SGD 100k
more SRS, perhaps invested in SGD stocks

--new: how much liquid cash to hold
200k might be too much

--fuxi: in last Ikea meal, I criticized wife for a tiny $2.60 cheese tart (meimei didn't eat more than one bit), but I spent a much larger $16 on the lamb shank for boy

--fuxi:
After moving to Becky Ma's place at Boston beside Tuft's hospital, I predicted it would be the best rental home for us ever.

Now I predict that the current Hib19 carefree ezlife is the best ever, due to brbr and other things.

--fuxi: first state div advantage: Rebecca said this fund can hold long-term.
If I put in 10k and hold 20Y, then it's kinda reward for her work

--fuxi: again and again, I'm facing the same dilemma:
if each decision is 20k+, then risk of mistake feels unbearable.
If each decision is 1k-, then I feel the oth, obsession, .

Can we strike a balance? I think we may need to be confident.

.. case: properties
.. case: T:US: I think we can sink in large amounts like 3k due to my prev xp
.. case: SIA: due to the commission, I think we should commit 7k+ from SRS
.. case: divAdv fund. Thanks to my prev xp I think we can commit 5k, perhaps from SRS
.. case: gold: thanks to my extensive analysis and due to the large bid/ask spread, i think we can commit bigger amounts like 3K+
