-- next visit to Cambodia
Visit Cambodia after next payout in Feb 2020 -- Withdraw all USD in big notes and bring to SG.

--some lux items, highlighting diverging personal priorities
Japan vacation with kids -- is probably the most visible lux items. I may need to say No. Consider postponing it to my 60's when they grow up.
top schools (+school district) -- fraction of a million. Simply beyond my means

full-day interview -- costs me a day of billing, but no more than 3 days a year

--review aviva shield payment?
LGpp I trust their system

--Q: our predicted burn rate with maid? 7k
Q: is it even constructive to set a target?
I usually need (and benefit from) certainty, control, clarity ... --> assurance and confidence, but it can take a lot of effort (I ended up doing it only twice a year) and generate some stress.

young saver's account will have min balance only when meimei reaches 18

for ATM access, i will put my own money, not kid's money in this account.. Same as mayb. Alternatively, I can make do without ATM access.

--Q: what's the best use of additional 100k?
Some will actually spend it on fancy vacations
some will actually save it up to support top school districts or educational programs
I will consider
* lower-paying job with more satisfaction
* more time with grandparents

--new blogpost
Many fellow parents (plan to) spend so much on their kids because .. they want-to not pressured-to. Chinese parents feel good about martyrdom -- saving up and spending it on kids education. 

Labor of love... However, Some (33 to 50%) of my peers appear to be under pressure to spend such huge amounts, due to peer pressure and societal expectation like a "norm".

How am I different?
I don't plan to spend on branded college, so there's a 50/50 chance I won't start saving until 4Y before college
I don't want to spend on luxury vacations as an "education" -- unnecessary and too costly
I do consider taking lower jobs to spend more time with kids.
I plan to spend on kids' non-academic pursuits, as Jenny on swimming
--fuxi: port liberty is inferior to newport in terms of connectivity ...
--fuxi: I have no time for frequent exp tracking but need to feel the outflow...Avoid card payment. 
However, need to carry less cash.... reduce mental load. Leave $50 in office drawer and $100 in home drawer, so carry $100 until I get used to it
