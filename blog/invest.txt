--update blogpost on kids,,,deprivation
The spending habits of my wife and kids imply a burn rate that is 50% higher than the $3k/M estimate in my bare-bones ffree.

I have reason to believe that once kids grow up, that burn rate will drop.

--update blog on 3ffree :
if living with grandma in my 60's, then my burn rate would be higher by ... 1k? but grandma would join us with her savings.

--fuxi: Genn
make your wife feels that she could spend her money any way she wants. The 100k is her money just like her own salary. 

Trust that she won't overspend. She is not a teenager.

--wife's allowance
1800 increased to 2500 due to maid
now should go back to 1800 but she has no salary. 
I will pay for all enrichments (perhaps $1k/m)

split 11k her-30/70-me so that she receives $1k/m during Jan to Nov

Clawback $700 for Jan allowance.

Point of future adjustment -- monthly allowance

..11k transfer:
done: $1k from 198 to OCBC
done: simultaneously recording 30k for gp

--update blog: other derailers of my ffree
All of these adversities demand financial resources and can drain my reserve.
major investment loss like a property devaluation. 
divorce
wife's health
kids' health
kids' injury
