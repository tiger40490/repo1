concerns
62 -- before this age, withdrawals will incur 5% early withdrawal penalty (no minimum). The other 95% will be consider assessable income
after 62. 50% of the withdrawal amount goes into asessable income

Here's my withdrawal plan, Assuming I still have high salary in the U.S. but not in SG:

before 62 I can withdraw around 20k/Y. I pay 5% early withdrawal penalty. The other 19k goes into assessible income and hopefully incur no tax.
after 62 I can withdrawl up to 40k/Y. Half of it will be assessable income to IRAS. 20k chargeable will incur 0 tax

CPF top-up is an alternative

-- compared to condos, sg landed prop has even lower rental yield and demand.
Most renters won't need such a big home.
Also, most renters don't want to drive every day. Landed properties usually lack public transport connectivity.

In SG the hawker center stalls are not popular with the younger generation of stall owners.  This trend could translate to nutrition inflation. 

However, foreigners owners might be taking over the stalls.

My friend K Hu's email is quite in-depth. I can see that he still works hard for long-term family livelihood. 

( I guess Ashish is more carefree, due to bachelor's life. )

I'm older and more mellow in terms of Brbr, exclub/FOLB, ambition, career growth... 
Wellness, lifestyle adjustment, healthcare, choice of home country, retirement planning are more important as I grow older.

Cashflow is a factor (sometimes a minor factor) in each topic above.
However, cashflow should not dominate every topic.

--fuxi: envious of U.S. superior income
I tend to look up towards U.S. and HK as high-income countries. Here's my critical assessment
* for tech professionals: Yes U.S. (not HK) is much higher than SG, but BR is also higher, so brbr is unclear.
* for WallSt techies: Yes U.S. and HK are higher-income than SG and many more jobs, but BR is higher. Brbr is probably inferior to SG.
* for main street: U.S. (not HK) is higher-income than SG, but BR is higher. Brbr is unclear.

However, there are many other factors such as social safety net, job opportunities, edu options,

I feel the long-term burn rate is SGD 5k including bx premiums, taxes, airtickets

-- fuxi: %%avg return rate
properties outperformed. Even without appreciation, the rental savings alone translates to at least 4% net return
my unit trusts -- probably 2-4%
Private equity -- I managed to recover from a big loss (Airtropolic), so barely positive return overall

A rigorous calc would include unrealized pnl from mark-to-market, ...

I have a blogpost on the highest returns achieved. I think it's in compound

--fuxi: FCF and big investments
Some higih-earning individuals are unable to buy a home. I think my ex-colleagues Damien, Pinsky might be among them. I imagine they don't give it priority. 

They could pay a high rent (up to 40% of their income), take a car loan to drive an expensive car, ... basically spend 99% of their salary every year. It's never hard to find ways to spend money.

The high rent, of course, goes down the drain. 

Big investments don't necessarily require high brbr, but require savings i.e. FCF.

--fuxi: t-budget for [[irrational exuberance]]?
Probably no impact on my investment decisions.

--fuxi: what FSM funds are suitable for wife's 5k portfolio?
high risk high return equity funds. US funds? but now might be a wrong time to go in.
SIA is better

-- fuxi or update blogpost on brbr?
Compared to 2016, my burn rate is down by 2-3k, partly due to pre-school, airfare, ...

Now i understand that $1k to $2k reduction in burn rate means a lot to my (brbr and) sense of confidence, peaceful leisure, wealth. I think this reveals a fundamental difference between me and my peers.

Exclub wealth? Not enhanced by brbr improvement.
