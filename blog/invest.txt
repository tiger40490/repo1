--fuxi or update one of my many tanbinvest blogposts like carefree
looking at my age group and younger peers and beyond, why am i financially carefree but they aren't?
#1 current Brbr
#2 long-term medical (including nursing) fund, retirement fund, inflation protection
#3 Fuller wealth: sizeable nonwork income on adequate assets, as measured by burn rate

But some non-financial factors are fundamental to the financial equation -- wellness, stable marriage, the country

--fuxi: at my age, how important is investment analysis
I told  Rebecca that investment analysis is an obsession among some friends I met recently. 
I think my biggest tcosts and worst ROTI was in stock/FSM

I told Rebecca that health and career longevitiy (job security) are more important.
I guess the underlying message was -- my wealth mgmt job is basically done.

Rebecca pointed out most of the spare cash can (had better be) invested, not "left in the bank account" earning 2%

-- fuxi: allocation between stocks, ETF and mutual funds
Rebecca said many people among her clients (and also her own parents) allocate more to mutual funds than stocks. Why? distraction, obsession, and volatility.

I asked about index ETF and she had nothing bad to say. I think for U.S. market, ETF is the default choice.

-- first state div advantage: Rebecca said this fund can hold long-term.
If I put in 10k and hold 20Y, then it's kinda reward for her work

-- again and again, I'm facing the same dilemma:
if each decision is 20k+, then risk of mistake feels unbearable.
If each decision is 1k-, then I feel the oth, obsession.

Can we strike a balance? I think we need to be confident.

.. case: properties
.. case: T:US: I think we can sink in large amounts like 3k due to my prev xp
.. case: SIA: due to the commission, I think we should commit 7k+ from SRS
.. case: divAdv fund. Thanks to my prev xp I think we can commit 5k, perhaps from SRS
.. case: gold: thanks to my extensive analysis and due to the large bid/ask spread, i think we can commit bigger amounts like 3K+

--no blog
XH felt $2M asset would support a comfortable burn rate without salary. I said that's too hard for most people. However, I think he is not obsessed and fixated on that target... fortunately for him.

Retirement country's economy is a crucial factor.
My parents are receiving increasing pension. The China system is showing no risk of bankruptcy.

SG's system is mostly based on self-contribution, but the government invests the cpf fund to generate decent return for us. The SGD's strength is based on the local economy.

U.S. system appears to be broken. The social security money we contributed are pooled and distributed based on needs, not based on contribution :(
