if living with grandma in my 60's, then my burn rate would be higher by ... 1k?

make your wife feels that she could spend her money any way she wants. The 100k is her money just like her own salary. 

Trust that she won't overspend. She is not a teenager.


--wife's allowance
1800 increased to 2500 due to maid
now should go back to 1800 but she has no salary. 
I will pay for all enrichments (perhaps $1k/m)

split 11k her-30/70-me so that she receives $1k/m during Jan to Nov

..11k transfer:
11k all to wife would require
$1k from 198 to 153
$10k from 108 -> 153, simultaneously recording 30k for gp

--update blog: other derailers of my ffree
major investment loss like a property devaluation. 
medical condition
divorce
