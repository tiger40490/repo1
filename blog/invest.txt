--new:covid19 inflation risk
Most of my properties' valuations have a positive correlation with inflation. Like bond coupons, my GRR nonwork income would suffer from inflation, but long-term rental growth may speed up.

Dividend stocks would probably protect me from inflation risk.

Endowment policy holders among my friends would probably suffer from inflation.

--new: cryptocurrency as a combo of gold+mastercard
I feel this currency is like gold, with a limited supply, and chosen as a medium of excahnge

The supply of a given currency is limited, artifically. Increasing demand would bid up the valuation, until another crypotocurrency (a new kid on the block) is born with a 100B initial circulation.

Like gold, mastercard became a medium of exchange. 

Each system enhancement on a given currency could increase its competitive chance of becoming the next mastercard.
