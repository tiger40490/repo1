--new: too much cash saved for legacy
My "challenge" in this blogpost is not having too little left for my kids, but having too much cash now, 50Y before my expected end of life. This is a minor challenge compared to all my other challenges.

Default plan is not donation but legacy to my 2 children and grandchildren (if I'm lucky). If something happens to them and my wife goes before me, then donation is an acceptable default.

Most important-yet-neglected factors within my control -- 1) longevity and career longevity 2) what my kids become. These controllable factors ought to be my focus.

Next, keep an eye on the long-horizon risks, beyond inflation. See my blogpost on "financial protections: powerless against some rare disasters"

Next question: what asset classes are suitable for holding long-term beyond 50Y.

If I have more confidence about holding long-term, then I can afford to take more risks. However, I hate long troughs (see the other blogpost)
* gold, 
stocks, 
properties

--no blog: any spare cash now can go into
* cpf SA towards ERS, but illiquid till 65
* cpf OA -- illiquid till 55
* gold -- might suffer a 10Y trough 
* US stocks -- might suffer a 5Y trough

-- Hi my sister,
othRisk

Re your "vague" question of what I want to achieve with my investment effort, I have a longer answer now, hopefully not so vague ;)

Indeed I still spend several weeks each quarter on investment research/review/decisions. I adjust my views (more often than my portfolio) rather actively.

Even though I feel almost "job done" (i.e. I can retire to a thrifty retirement), there's still some cashflow anxiety beneath the surface.

First goal I want to achieve with my investment is relief from that anxiety. Comparatively, I'm on a very comfortable cashflow "high ground", so my anxiety is less than other people's. Specifically, I will say there's risk that we could fall sick, or suffer an investment loss or make other oversized mistakes. Additional incomes (hopefully diversified and without 10Y wait) are the relief.

The Second (very specific) goal I want to achieve with my investment is relief from long commute, which  is a common pain in NY area. Most people seem to put up with it but I hate long commute. With more investment income, I can afford to live closer to office, or take lower-paying jobs closer to home.

Another goal I want to achieve with my investment is extra reserve to support big ticket items such as college. I don't need an even bigger home, but my wife has persuaded me to consider a bigger home. Vacations are unnecessary to my simple life, but my wife would appreciate them.

As I said, most of my peers (Chinese professionals in finance) set a target to save more than a million dollars for top school-district housing and top colleges. These are luxury items, not suitable for lower-middle class like me. To them I say NO Thanks.

-- fuxi or update blogpost on brbr?
Compared to 2016, my burn rate is down by 2-3k, partly due to pre-school, airfare, ...

Now i feel $1k to $2k reduction in burn rate means a lot to my (brbr and) sense of confidence, peaceful leisure, wealth. I think this reveals a fundamental difference between me and my peers.

Exclub wealth? Not enhanced by brbr improvement.

--update blogpost on 3 likely derailers of current carefree easy life
My current carefree phase has lasted more than a year since late 2018. 

Q: what are the derailers observed so far, based on facts, not forecasts not sentiments?
A: The only brief derailers were ah-boy's math weakness and the lockdown pains. In terms of sentiments I worried briefly about PIP

Perhaps the academic pressure can be considered a long-term worry

Let's put on the red and black hats, and throw open this question to get more ideas

I think this is a short-horizon analysis, not so valuable. Beware othRisk -- Most of the major identifiable derailers are probably listed in the blogpost already. 

Some major derailers are hard to foresee. How about
* family harmony disrupted
* something broken at home
* something lost
* conflicts with colleagues
* medical conditions
* injuries
* accidents
