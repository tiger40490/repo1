--sugg: transfer some 10k from OA to SA ?
Ask CPF to compute the additional interest earned each year

--I used to feel a pressure, an obligation to periodically review and update my portfolio. 
Now I feel robinhood and fsm portfolios are small and should not interfere with my life. 
I prefer to look at them as recreation and only when free.

--now I feel my FSM process is low-efficiency
slow selection
distraction
if I invest more, distraction would grow. 
If I invest less, the profit potential would remain low.. low roti. Just recreational investing.

Shall I control it so I invest bigger amounts provided I don't do anything during office hours. Perhaps set sms to wife's number

--China funds
now is good time to invest my SGD to buy China stocks?

--new: ffree=unrealistic4some Chinese middle-class
talking to Jack Zhang and Henry Yin, I feel the stereotypical Chinese middle class (my own peer group) is basically hopeless to achieve ffree. 
Their idea of "enough" non-work income is something like USD10k/month. 

I feel that's naive. Here we are talking about affluence rather than ultra-rich, so our concept of ffree is not "spending-as-much-as-we-want". ffree rests upon responsible, disciplined spending, budgeting, making-ends-meet.

Responsible is the keyword -- review, account for and adjust our monthly/quarterly spend. If you don't enjoy this "responsibility", then ffree will be a pain 

For many years, I believe my wif and I can be realistically satisfied with SGD 3k non-work income. (4k as a family of 4)

Location is key. Housing, medical cost and education are some of the biggest concerns. I achieved my basic ffree precisely because I have my answers to each question.

The early-retirement-extreme author also has answers to each question.

i feel good not conceited about my burn rate + savings rate. Also proud of my passive income. This is a constant wellspring of positive feeling. Hopefully no attachment. 

I mention my ffree to many people and I start to feel positive about it, hopefully not losing my feet on the ground.

If we keep control over our burn rate, basic ffree is not unrealistic, largely thanks to medishield.

--non-work income is more encompassing than passive income. IN my blog, should Use it more 

--fuxi: SG is a consumer city. Sooo many low-cost or high-cost "goods" including heavy marketing of overseas vacation destinations. I believe overseas vacations are very expensive, lavish and not worthwhile at all.

I need to stand my ground and accept only SEA destinations. No Japan please

--grandpa$$+me: maintain in google drive? higher privacy than github?

--I need reliable history of the realized dividend yield for each stock
Robinhood doesn't provide it. Might be a good thing -- less distraction ...

--Ashish's INR CD
