-- update blogpost on bluechips vs mufu
Q: if a mufu like DIVA can pay 4% dividend, what's the advantage of MOETF hitting DYOC 4% after tax?
A: I doubt a mufu can generate 4% DYOC consistently without eroding NAV. I don't think I have seen any. Let's check out DIVA
A: an ETF will probably beat the mufu in terms of annual fees
A: MOETF will beat ETF on a few fronts. Financially, I could liquidate individual constituent stocks.

However, I do agree that dividend tax is a disadvantage of MOETF. Luckily, as U.S. tax payer, my annual income would be so low that my marginal tax rate would be far below 20%.

Tcost is another disadvantage but as an recreational investor I treat it as recreation and learning.

-- SRS .. can buy annuity .. less tax :)
But I don't know any annuity to buy.

t-spend on burn rate Control
jolt
is my monthly exp recon too time-consuming?

In terms of ROTI, monthly exp recon beats investment analysis in stocks and funds. 

need4reflect?
the time spent on burn rate control (including exp recon) is rather high, perhaps higher than parenting analysis, QQ..
However, this t-spend is among the most practical, fruitful and time-honored.

I think most oridnary folks don't have my level of patience, interest, determination.

Remember that burn rate is among my top 5 unique strengths, my top 3 long-term livelihood shields, my top 5 cancer-stress relieves.. The huge value come at a high tCost.

--no blog Q: shall I increase number of FSM holdings but keep each amount low?
I used to have that but then I sold most of them to simplify my life. They do become a distraction.

As recreation investing, they are less distractive than stocks.

--fuxi: contingency cash reserve
How much is reasonable?
Park where? DBM multipler? No
FSM? 

-- fuxi: stock CDY is not a valuable criteria because
price can change fast, invalidating the CDY figure, due to SnD
div amount can change (dramatically) next quarter due to profit and management 

Instead I would focus more on DYOC, dividend stability.

As to mufu, NAV is not driven by SnD.

-- fuxi: Cambodia and BGC rEstate mkt: both driven by Chinese hot money
--fuxi: terminate dbs ccard 3M after confirming the end of multiplier bonus? Terminate to keep my life simpler.
also transfer most of the fund to FSM, but keep the multipler account as just another bank account.

-- correlation of psf and d2mrt is not so clear. 
I think the count of interested buyers for each unit is very small, unlike gold.
We rarely have 2 identical units only different in terms of d2mrt, unlike commodities.

-- financial health of wq.l
bought a 120sqm home for 750k. 30Y mtg, serviced entirely by CPF. When there's surplus CPF balance, they would pay down the mtg.

School costs are very low (until college). Kids' clothing cost is low accoring to him. The burden of parenting is mostly energy/time, not financial. This is stark contrast to the mainstream perception "raising one more kid in Singapore possibly costs more than a $1million."

A telltale sign of his strain -- WQ.l feels college cost would be much higher, even with the subsidies and student loans. Even before that phase, Tanko may say that unplanned events could derail their low-cost lifestyle for the next few years.

I think they are a frugal family. I think the mother has to go out and earn a salary.

No property investment. No tuition.

-- new deliverymen's brbr #free agent
t_fomo^livelihood 
t_jolt
(This blogpost is mostly about finance..)

[a=at or above my idea of barebones livelihood, something of a luxury]

looking at the deliverymen and Uber drivers I think these free agents have to work relatively long hours in reality.

What if he only needs to work a minimum of 0-4 hours a day, as extra hours become leisure? 

(As with Tanko's brothers) Let's further assume _basic_ healthcare, housing and education are provided by government. 

Q: Is this (comparable to my) carefree ezlife, based on excellent brbr? 

His burn rate would be much lower than his cohort, as he rejects FOMO such as
* [a] top schools
* [a] big car, or any car
* [a] overseas vacations. The low-income, big families tend to prefer staycation
* [a] restaurants

[a] I would say these are luxury items unnecessary for a happy fulfilling life on earth. 

Q: How is his lifestyle different from FIRE?
A: nonwork income like investment payout is instrumental to FIRE. Note long-horizon windfall profit doesn't help.
A: FIRE is about removing depednency on salary. The deliveryman still needs salary to make ends meet.

Q: How does his lifestyle compare to the Khmer villagers?
A: [!a] healthcare, [!a] edu, [!a] housing provisions, even [!a] food security is not great in today's Cambodia.

Q: how is XH.Fu's life different with 2 kids and lots of free time?
A: I think XH's income is comparable to (not lower than) his cohort. XH trades [a] job security for abundance of free time.

Actually the free agents enjoy limited job security, and worry about sudden job loss, sick leave, medical bills etc.

Q (side question): with his spare time, does he adopt a healthier lifestyle than his cohort?
A: I think most adults have just enough leisure time to lead a healthier life, so time is a factor but not a limiting factor. Motivation is the real limiting factor.

--update blogpost on brbr
barber's 压力 is presumably brbr. If they earn 2k and spend only $500, then no ground for complaint.

FOMO is probably another factor. The essential needs are probably $500/M
