.. concerns
before 62, withdrawals will incur 5% early withdrawal penalty (no minimum). The other 95% will be considered assessable income

after 62. No penalty, 50% of the withdrawal amount goes into asessable income

.. simple plan: Assuming I still have high salary in the U.S. but not in SG:
Lock up 10k in 2020 to save $1.5k as cash payout. When not working in SG, withdraw $10k (up to 20k) and pay 5% penalty ($500).

If no investment return then the 10% gain would be too low to compensate for the loss of liquidity over the intervening years? 

I think I am likely to invest it, but for now, let's assume laziness and LGpp.

.. slightly bigger plan
before 62 I can withdraw around 20k/Y. I pay 5% early withdrawal penalty. The other 19k goes into assessible income and hopefully incur no tax.
after 62 I can withdrawl up to 40k/Y. Half of it will be assessable income to IRAS. 20k chargeable will incur 0 tax

CPF top-up is an alternative, but more severe liquidity constraint

-- new: $1k reduction ] burn rate

Exclub wealth? Not enhanced by brbr improvement.

--fuxi: envious of U.S. superior income
I tend to look up towards U.S. and HK as high-income countries. Here's my critical assessment
* for inet tech professionals: Yes U.S. (not HK) is much higher than SG, but BR is also higher, so brbr is unclear.
* for WallSt techies: Yes U.S. and HK are higher-income than SG and offer many more jobs, but BR is higher. Brbr is probably inferior to SG.
* for main street techies: U.S. (not HK) is higher-income than SG, but BR is higher. Brbr is unclear.

However, there are many other factors such as social safety net, job opportunities, edu options, 

-- fuxi: %%avg return rate
properties outperformed. Even without appreciation, the rental savings alone translates to at least 4% net return
my unit trusts -- probably 2-4%
Private equity -- I managed to recover from a big loss (Airtropolic), so barely positive return overall

A rigorous calc would include unrealized pnl from mark-to-market, ...

I have a blogpost on the highest returns achieved. I think it's in compound
