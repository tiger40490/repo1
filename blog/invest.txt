To improve my commute flexibility, am willing to accept a 5m cycling trip from home to the rail station.
This could help my wife's or kids' commutes.

Note my evening commute is much less stressful.

Financial health is more affected by brbr than income or asset. 

Financial health is far less important than health.

"revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator." according to https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-life-lfc-great-value-165004399.html.

I think book value is also less manipulated including assets and liabilities.

Profits i.e. earnings, dividends are all easier to manipulate by accountants.

-- new or fuxi: boost MOETF DYOC
Right now, my diversification effort is not boosting aggregate DYOC

Should I cut some low-yield positions and top up on some high-yield stocks?

-- new: stocks are always high risk high return.
i think the stereotypical retail investors would consider stocks only for growth, not passive income. To them, a stock is either high return or nothing. They hear about dividend investors' stories, and also value-investing, but most of them decide to focus on high growth stocks.

Kun.H said "dividend is a secondary attraction/motivation." The main reason to consider any stock is invariably capital appreciation, hopefully a windfall. Kun is more intellectual and more analytical than other retail investors. His comments are articulate. 

Tian Jue said many investors have a reasonable, human desire beyond stable, dependable dividend. I guess it's a higher desire for ... windfall profit. I guess it's similar to higher desires like lottery, bigger home, top college,,,,, These higher desires drive up valuation to unreasonable levels.

Because these desires are based mostly on emotion, they can become irrational. Compare to Vallue investing.

Consider investing $500 into 25 growth stocks. To support firewall and buy-n-forget, I would need to limit each position to below $20.
Beware of the risk of temptation like tasty foods.

-- new HY stock^bonds
I now feel 4% DYOC stocks beat 6% high-yield bonds.

Granted the bonds guarantee the payment rate but look at credit quality, reliability and appreciation.

if a bond has 6% coupon rate, then credit risk and dependability is questionable

if a bond is relatively safe with, eg 4% coupon rate, then I would say a 3% DYOC stock would be quite possibly comparable quality.

In all cases, the stock has chance of appreciation/depreciation.

A 4% CDY aristocrat beats most of the bonds out there.

MOETF return is likely lower than Buffett, which is likely no better than sp500
Do I envy those with higher annual returns? Typically we are seeing BTC or growth stock investors.

buffett: better risk-adjusted return than sp500

-- update: I guess ETFs mostly invest in popular stocks. 
The steady increase in ETF participation probably leads to more concentration more gravitation to the big index-component stocks. 
As ETFs become increasingly popular vis-a-vis stock-picking, the popular stocks probably receive even more mindshare and volume than before. 
These hot stocks probably become more volatile due to retail hot money.

Last time was eq mufu. In hindsight, I didn't learn a lot. Actually, I was not able to. The mufu funds are almost opaque and rigid. I couldn't follow my views on individual companies.

Canadian stocks are not the only ones with withholding tax. Year-end 1099-DIV form has the most reliable data

Luckily, some (or all) the withholding taxes are recoverable if you file a US tax return.

--update 
utility stocks including T:US need to pay high CDY as they are seen as low growth, which dampens investor demand

VZ is seen as higher growth

a payout of 70–80% of FFO is the industry average, regardless of taxable income.


-- fuxi or new: %% favorate assets=seldom very-mainstream
I shun SG condos. I favor SEA emerging market rEstate.
I shun growth stocks. My dividend stocks are supposed to be mainstream among retirees, but my cohort are not retirees and I don't know anyone interested in my low-growth dividend stocks.
I favor a large number of often unknown stocks.
I shun new HDB flats.

I have repeatedly halved my mufu allocation. Mufu is probably more mainstream than stock-picking

t-spend on burn rate Control
is my monthly exp recon too time-consuming?

need4reflect?
the time spent on burn rate control (including exp recon) is rather high, perhaps higher than parenting analysis, QQ..
However, this t-spend is among the most practical, fruitful and time-honored.

I think most oridnary folks don't have my level of patience, interest, determination.

Remember that burn rate is among my top 5 unique strengths, my top 3 long-term livelihood shields, my top 5 cancer-stress relieves.. The huge value come at a high tCost.

Roaming retirement in cheaper cities would reduce my food + transport 

-- update blogpost on inflation
but which post?
Most reputable authors from U.S., China, and other countries present inflation risk as one of the most serious risks for retirees. However, SG trec is much much better. However, my friend Tianjue disagrees...

I think the count of interested buyers for each unit is very small, unlike gold.
We rarely have 2 identical units only different in terms of d2mrt, unlike commodities.
