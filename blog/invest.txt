-- new: %% favorate assets=never very-mainstream
I shun SG condos. I favor SEA emerging market rEstate.
I shun growth stocks. My dividend stocks are supposed to be mainstream among retirees, but my cohort are not retirees and I don't know anyone interested in my low-growth dividend stocks.
I favor a large number of often unknown stocks.
I shun new HDB flats.

I have repeatedly halved my mufu allocation. Mufu is probably more mainstream than stock-picking

t-spend on burn rate Control
is my monthly exp recon too time-consuming?

need4reflect?
the time spent on burn rate control (including exp recon) is rather high, perhaps higher than parenting analysis, QQ..
However, this t-spend is among the most practical, fruitful and time-honored.

I think most oridnary folks don't have my level of patience, interest, determination.

Remember that burn rate is among my top 5 unique strengths, my top 3 long-term livelihood shields, my top 5 cancer-stress relieves.. The huge value come at a high tCost.

-- correlation of psf and d2mrt is not so clear. 
I think the count of interested buyers for each unit is very small, unlike gold.
We rarely have 2 identical units only different in terms of d2mrt, unlike commodities.

-- fuxi: financial health of LZ.Yu
mortgage outsanding is about 50% of the purchase price. I didn't ask the purchase price.

LZ.Yu said he has only one salary + some small investment income. He emphasized the reliance on his savings. 
His wife can, if so desired, find a job.

LZ needs to bankroll daughter's education beyond bachelor's because he believes Master is necessary.

If we compare property net income. Mine is probably $2k+ but his is negative.

-- fuxi: financial health of wq.l
bought a 120sqm home for 750k. 30Y mtg, serviced entirely by CPF. When there's surplus CPF balance, they would pay down the mtg.

School costs are very low (until college). Kids' clothing cost is low accoring to him. The burden of parenting is mostly energy/time, not financial. This is stark contrast to the mainstream perception "raising one more kid in Singapore possibly costs more than a $1million."

A telltale sign of his strain -- WQ.l feels college cost would be much higher, even with the subsidies and student loans. Even before that phase, Tanko may say that unplanned events could derail their low-cost lifestyle for the next few years.

I think they are a frugal family. I think the mother has to go out and earn a salary.

No property investment. No tuition.
