--new: windfall->legacy
I think some property investors focused on windfall are hoping to build a legacy for their kids.

Legacy is valuable to some extent but is a low priority to me.

Property markets and my offspring's priorities are too hard to predict, over the long horizon.

--new: quality@edu!=measured by college(research)prestige
My first hand experience on quality of eduction : 
UChicago uses all master grads as tutors while NUS strictly employes only PhD holders as tutorial teachers.

MSFM: Two of the most important lecturers were PhD candidates

NUS tutorial class size is up to 20 students, as the 200+ students were divided into tutorial groups. In contrast, UChicago has one big tutorial class.

UChicago has 3-hour lectures, clearly lower quality than the hourly lectures at NUS.

Job interviewers mostly guage aptitudes and to a lesser extent communications/personality. The aptitute needs learning and growing. The primary factor is motivation (beside talent). For this reason, quality of education matters.

For my son, internship would be part of "quality@edu".

--update blogpost
My 2009 Roth401k voluntary contribution was a regrettable decision. The money is now locked-up when I need it (now).

When the money someday gets unlocked, I won’t need it as much as now.

--new: looking at BGC, Phnom Penh, I now feel Singapore (and perhaps Hongkong) will not be overtaken by these cities. There's no visible risk. The probability of that event is close to zero.

I feel KL is much better but still lightyears behind.

I might be biased in favor of Singapore.

--new: ##derailers@current ffree "easy life"
My ffree "easy life" would become tough if I face PIP.

If no PIP, then job search obstacles (Re Deepak, CSY, Pinsky, XR) would be the next biggest headache. I would feel trapped and unwanted.

If no such obstacle, then kids' grades would be the next headache.

In contrast, I now believe long commute is actually not such a pain. I somehow got used to the Bayonne 3-segment commute.

Back to ffree state-of-mind... Can I feel comfortable about a SGD 2k burn rate? The more comfortable, the more confident.

--wife still feels we need higher earning because we still feel the strain of parenting due to limited financial resources.

In the U.S. I would feel the strain of long commute.

Family will probably find our home small and old.

I could invest in renovation (comfort) rather than size (appreciation). 

--fuxi
I allow myself to feel superior about my burn rate and Fuller wealth, but I Don’t want to fall into the trap of benchmarking with the high earners.

--fuxi: the BGC agency search is a valuable hard-lesson experience. I foresee I would have similar situations and requirements going forward.

--fuxi: Ashish's INR CD 
convert SGD->INR, invest for 1Y for 7%, convert back to SGD.
cost: bank FX spread
risk: FX ~ 2% a year
tcost is very low. Just transfer $1k to Ashish

--sugg: consider investing CPF-OA balance into U.S. 
Should be able to beat 2.5%
no guilt no hurry

* If recreational amount, then too much tcost.
* If 20k, then I need to convince myself to take the plunge. I would say that long term prospect is good.

--sugg: transfer some 1k from OA to SA just to live through it.
Ask CPF to compute the additional interest earned each year
Can do this during lunch break
