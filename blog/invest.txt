--wife's allowance

make your wife feels that she could spend her money any way she wants. The 100k is her money just like her own salary. 

Trust that she won't overspend. She is not a teenager.

1800 increased to 2500 due to maid
now should go back to 1800 but she has no salary. 
I will pay for all enrichments (perhaps $1k/m)

Clawback $700 for Jan allowance.

Point of future adjustment -- monthly allowance

..11k transfer:
done: $1k from 198 to OCBC
done: simultaneously recording 30k for gp

--involve boy in FSM investment analysis and decision
This is more realistic, applied math
