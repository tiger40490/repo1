--two definitinos of wealth
Fuller wealth -- based on minimalist burn rate 
ExclusiveClub wealth -- based on comparing with the Joneses -- power to lift the same heavy weights as the strongmen. Heavy weights like nice homes, branded college, nice vehicles, first-class vacations

I feel in everyday conversation, wealth refers to the 2nd meaning, but once a while, many people actually refer to Fuller wealth.

For a resident in a given country, free education, free healthcare, subsidized housing, Denmark-style income security ... contribute to Fuller wealth, but none of these contribute to your ExclusiveClub wealth.

Similarly, local inflation affects your Fuller wealth but doesn't really affect exclusiveClub wealth because inflation affects everyone.

--update blogpost on 3likely derailers of current carefree easy life
My current carefree phase has lasted years since late 2018. 

Q: what are the derailers observed so far, based on facts, not forecasts?
A: The only brief derailers were ah-boy's math weakness and the lockdown pains.

Perhaps the academic pressure can be considered a long-term worry

Let's put on the red and black hats, and throw open this question to get more ideas

I think this is a short-horizon analysis, not so valuable. Beware othRisk -- Most of the major identifiable derailers are probably listed in the blogpost already. 

Some major derailers are hard to foresee. How about
* family harmony disrupted
* something broken at home
* something lost
* conflicts with colleagues
* medical conditions
* injuries
* accidents
