-- new jolt: while cutting nonessential spends, where Not to cut
i decided to cut burn rate on tuition, piano learning, Siloso ... to keep burn rate under 4k.

Q: so where DO we allow ourselves to spend more? A lifestyle creep question.
A: (default answer) probably nowhere. 

I think for many inviduals, this question is extremely tempting and powerful. Many would feel deprived if they see a windfall investment gain (or bonus), small investment gains accumulating, or months of regular savings... but somehow unable to spend it.

Singapore past reserves is a semi-relevant case study. PAP government refuse to spend the reserve. I think every year's investment return is split 50/50 so half of it is spendable.

As a family, it's important to recognize we are not a country, so I am much more frugal with my growing reserve.

PAP government was proven right when the past reserve had to be deployed (not depleted) in rainy days. Without the fiscal discipline over the decades, it would have been depleted earlier.

-- update blogpost on burn rate exclusions: 
I have a consistent definition of monthly burn rate, which enabled me to see a trend.

exclude invisible spend by wife
include tax monthly 

-- new: t-spend on burn rate Control
need4reflect?
the time spent on burn rate control (including exp tracking) is rather high, perhaps higher than parenting analysis, QQ..
However, this t-spend is among the most practical, fruitful and time-honored.

I think most oridnary folks don't have my level of patience, interest, determination.

Remember that burn rate is among my top 5 unique strengths, my top 3 long-term livelihood shields, my top 5 cancer-stress relieves
It does come at a price.

--fuxi or new: longevity health is ellusive but financial health, in contrast, can be strengthened. Key drivers are 1) higher current income and 2) burn rate control 3) maintain salary (a topic for another blog)

Buy more :
* risky high-yield assets, like Energy12
* safer low-yield assets
* risky low-yield high-growth assets, like SIA

dividend stocks? I have been thinking of 10k-100k allocation to T:US

Jill's products do not provide truly reliable current income. They are high-yield junk bonds.

Properties... no target. I should probably diversify to stocks

gold?

-- jolt: At my current income level,
* the running cost of dhost is negligible but I hate any negligent waste of money.
* DIY projects don't show significant cost saving but DIY is a life-enhancing, deeply satisfying experience

Besides, current income level is not yet enough assurance for financial livelihood. Therefore, I still feel the need to control burn rate. 

-- consolidate my "suggestions" to kondoko billing into one blogpost?
First tag the emails.

--fuxi: again and again, I'm facing the same dilemma:
if each decision is 20k+, then risk of mistake feels unbearable.
If each decision is 1k-, then I feel the oth, obsession, .

Can we strike a balance? I think we may need to be confident.

.. case: properties
.. case: T:US: I think we can sink in large amounts like 3k due to my prev xp
.. case: SIA: due to the commission, I think we should commit 7k+ from SRS
.. case: divAdv fund. Thanks to my prev xp I think we can commit 5k, perhaps from SRS
.. case: gold: thanks to my extensive analysis and due to the large bid/ask spread, i think we can commit bigger amounts like 3K+
