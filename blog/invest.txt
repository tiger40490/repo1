-- update blogpost...
why I wrote so many blogposts comparing my barebones ffree with my peers?

Because since my teenage years I have observed the vast majority of adults (99% of the people around me) and witnessed their struggle and stress, and later experience the same myself. 
Since 2017 I started seeing some reasons to feel free -- surreal. It demands a clarification. 

There are a few specific /identifiable/ differences (btw me and peers) not only in attitude but in the cashflow situation 
--jolt: basketball buying
I find it hard to accept that we bought so many and he didn't like those and insisted on a more suitable one.

Look in the mirror. I had the exact same experience with tablets and with cameras. Difference -- zsms

--need to set aside USD 101,400 for Flatiron
+ PGM warehouse
+ Peak rental income 
+ convert CNH
+ possibly some tax refund
+ Robinhood liquidate at profit
+ sell some FSM funds

With my low burn rate of, say, 3-5k, what if my wife earns $3k and I earn 6k from work? In theory my carefree easy life would be sustainable but would I really feel peace? 

--new: The most wasteful small purchases:
* basketball -- bought four so far. But there are many less visible wastes.
* board games, legos
* toys
* boy's stationeries
* kitchen utensils

Given these decisions are made consciously each time, they are much better than the invisible wastes.

Given the small sums, these wastes don't really threaten my bare-bones ffree, but they are fundamentally related to my views on deprivation, lavish etc

More damaging is buying harmful foods. We not only waste money, but also harm our health.

.. now some of the best small spends below ..
group workout
cheap exercise equipment
fancy fruits
salads
fancy dressing for raw reg
smoothie + chia
congee + chia

--fuxi: The names of many U.S. cities conjure up romatic images in my head, but to visit or retire there, main factor is 1) cost and 2) climate, 3) Chinese community

Therefore, I should consider Penang, Jiande only

--sugg: consider investing CPF-OA balance into U.S. stocks
Should be able to beat 3.5%
no guilt no hurry

* If recreational amount, then too much tcost.
* If 20k, then I need to convince myself to take the plunge. I would say that long term prospect is good.

Do I rather owe IRS a few thousand or be owed a few thousand?

I think IRS interest rate is low (like 3%), so I don't mind owing them.
