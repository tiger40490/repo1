-- stock picking
I spent tons of hours on FSM cherry-picking but underwhelming ROTI

Stock picking ? XR did that for a long time but not so spectacular

Just reading the newspapers alone would take lots of mental energy

-- new: ffree: j4 peer-comparison analysis
aboutOth

Q: Why writing so many blogposts comparing my ffree with peers?

Because since my teenage years I have observed the vast majority of adults (99% of the people around me) and witnessed their struggle and stress, and later experience the same myself. 
Since 2017 I started seeing some reasons to feel free -- surreal. It demands a clarification. 

There are a few specific /identifiable/ differences (btw me and peers) not only in attitude but in the cashflow situation 

Another j4 this comparative analysis -- FOMO esp. due to brank (game lost)

A secondary j4 -- rationalize my U.S. housing decision

--car ownership in SG
I used to feel inferior to those with a car.
Now I feel I don't need a car in SG. The flexibility benefit is minimal.

Previsouly, my sense of inadequacy regarding car ownership is based on naivity, but such naivity is universal just like perceived weakness in self-control. As I told Bindi, everyone is weak, but the 10-year old tan bin doesn't know it.

--updated blogpost on SG citizenship
oth
If SG citizenship offers so many tantalizing ffee/carefree features, then why are they unattractive to so many shrewd Chinese professionals?

A: citizenship is hard to get
A: even if we agree that SG citizenship contributes to a bare-bones ffree far out in the future, the contribution is small and unattractive to most people
A: At our age, to abandon the current home country (US or ..) and try out a small SEA country is highly questionable, risky and long shot

--jolt: basketball buying
I find it hard to accept that we bought so many and he didn't like those and insisted on a more suitable one.

Look in the mirror. I had the exact same experience with tablets and with cameras. Difference -- zsms

--new: The most wasteful small purchases:
* basketball -- bought four so far. But there are many less visible wastes.
* board games, legos
* toys
* boy's stationeries
* kitchen utensils

Given these decisions are made consciously each time, they are much better than the invisible wastes.

Given the small sums, these wastes don't really threaten my bare-bones ffree, but they are fundamentally related to my views on deprivation, lavish etc

More damaging is buying harmful foods. We not only waste money, but also harm our health.

.. now some of the best small spends below ..
group workout
cheap exercise equipment
fancy fruits
salads
fancy dressing for raw reg
smoothie + chia
congee + chia

--fuxi: The names of many U.S. cities conjure up romatic images in my head, but to visit or retire there, main factor is 1) cost and 2) climate, 3) Chinese community

Therefore, I should consider Penang, Jiande only

--sugg: consider investing CPF-OA balance into U.S. stocks
Should be able to beat 3.5%
no guilt no hurry

* If recreational amount, then too much tcost.
* If 20k, then I need to convince myself to take the plunge. I would say that long term prospect is good.

Do I rather owe IRS a few thousand or be owed a few thousand?

I think IRS interest rate is low (like 3%), so I don't mind owing them.
