--FCF and big investments
Some higih-earning individuals are unable to buy a home. I think my ex-colleagues Damien, Pinsky might be among them. I imagine they don't give it priority. 

They would pay a high rent (up to 40% of their income), take a car loan to drive an expensive car, ... basically spend 99% of their salary every year. It's relatively easy to find ways to spend money.

The high rent, of course, goes down the drain. 

Big investments don't necessarily require high brbr, but require savings i.e. FCF.

Probably no impact on my investment decisions.

-- what FSM funds are suitable for wife's 5k portfolio?

--new: too much cash saved for legacy
othRisk
My "challenge" in this blogpost is not having too little left for my kids, but having too much cash now, 50Y before my expected end of life. This is a minor challenge compared to all my other challenges.

Default plan is not donation but legacy to my 2 children and grandchildren (if I'm lucky). If something happens to them and my wife goes before me, then donation is an acceptable default.

Most important-yet-neglected factors within my control -- 1) longevity and career longevity 2) what my kids become. These controllable factors ought to be my focus.

Next, keep an eye on the long-horizon risks, beyond inflation. See my blogpost on "financial protections: powerless against some rare disasters"

Next question: what asset classes are suitable for holding long-term beyond 50Y.

If I have more confidence about holding long-term, then I can afford to take more risks. However, I hate long troughs (see the other blogpost)

-- Hi my sister,
othRisk

Re your "vague" question of what I want to achieve with my investment effort, I have a longer answer now, hopefully not so vague ;)

Indeed I still spend several weeks each quarter on investment research/review/decisions. I adjust my views (more often than my portfolio) rather actively.

Even though I feel almost "job done" (i.e. I can retire to a thrifty retirement), there's still some cashflow anxiety beneath the surface.

First goal I want to achieve with my investment is relief from that anxiety. Comparatively, I'm on a very comfortable cashflow "high ground", so my anxiety is less than other people's. Specifically, I will say there's risk that we could fall sick, or suffer an investment loss or make other oversized mistakes. Investment incomes (hopefully diversified and without a 10-year wait) are the relief I need.

The Second (specific) goal I want to achieve with my investment is relief from long commute, which is a common pain in NY/NJ area. Most people seem to put up with long commute but I hate it. With more investment income, I can afford to live closer to office, or take lower-paying jobs closer to home.

Another goal I want to achieve with my investment is extra reserve to support big ticket items such as college. I don't need an even bigger home, but my wife has persuaded me to consider a bigger home. Vacations are unnecessary to my simple life, but my wife would appreciate them.

As I said, most of my peers (Chinese professionals in finance or technology) set a target to save more than a million dollars for top school-district housing and top colleges. These are luxury items, not suitable for lower-middle class like me, with only a single income and two kids). To them I say NO Thanks.

Many of them consider the school-district home purchase (USD 700k+) an investment, but the monthly cost is heavy, including mortgage, property tax and maintenance, adding up to 4k to 6k.

-- fuxi or update blogpost on brbr?
Compared to 2016, my burn rate is down by 2-3k, partly due to pre-school, airfare, ...

Now i feel $1k to $2k reduction in burn rate means a lot to my (brbr and) sense of confidence, peaceful leisure, wealth. I think this reveals a fundamental difference between me and my peers.

Exclub wealth? Not enhanced by brbr improvement.

--update blogpost on 3 likely derailers of current carefree easy life
My current carefree phase has lasted more than a year since late 2018. 

Q: what are the derailers observed so far, based on facts, not forecasts not sentiments?
A: The only brief derailers were ah-boy's math weakness and the lockdown pains. In terms of sentiments I worried briefly about PIP

Perhaps the academic pressure can be considered a long-term worry

Let's put on the red and black hats, and throw open this question to get more ideas

I think this is a short-horizon analysis, not so valuable. Beware othRisk -- Most of the major identifiable derailers are probably listed in the blogpost already. 

Some major derailers are hard to foresee. How about
* family harmony disrupted
* something broken at home
* something lost
* conflicts with colleagues
* medical conditions
* injuries
* accidents
