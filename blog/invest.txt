buffett: better risk-adjsted return than sp500

-- new or update
For decades, I never perceived equity as a suitable investment for me. Too volatile. A long trough could last 10Y+, so I couldn't invest more than $1k.

Even now, when I look at the 100 well-known stocks across my familiar countries, I see the same unstable trend.

My eqMufu journey was long and wide. It confirmed the "theories". Instinctively, I always cash out at some small profit, because I knew that the profit is fleeting. Now I think the expRatio is forever erosive. 2% over 5Y means 10% erosion.

Then in 2013 that I realized US stocks have much better long-term trend than other regional markets. I still don't know why.

Only in 2020 did I find my "system" based on DYOC

I think very few single-name stocks have a primary listing outside the big4: NYSE, NSDQ, Amex, OTC*

In terms of volume, Bats might be the #3, but the number of names listed there is probably 300 only, and mostly ETFs

Re the stressor profiles

Once a few months I hit an all-at-once situation

MOETF return is likely lower than Buffett, which is likely no better than sp500
Do I envy those with higher annual returns? Typically we are seeing BTC or growth stock investors.

Is DIVA an arbitrage, sure-win?
Is Singapore condo a sure-win? I think many investors use maximum leverage  to invest in Singapore condos. Sure-win due to Ponzi nature. 

-- the base of my portfolio is HDB + rental properties. Insurance can't be the base because it is nonproductive. I liken insurance premium to option premium

gold as insurance against inflation (currency depreciation)
Few people expect to make money when buying insurance. If you by gold, don't keep looking at its market value. Put it aside just as you would do with an insurance policy.

Now I feel limit order placed outside trading hours is better than night-time active trading. 
Save time and energy.

Position a few fishing poles and check the status once a while.

-- hearing the taobao discussion in the C-epa team.. I feel spare-cash-rich people have a tendency to splurge on small fancy goods of acceptable quality.

Imagine you bring home 10k/M and saves 90%. Would you feel a urge to spend a bit more on those small "fancy" items like accessories?

An honest review may show that those small spends add up to, say $2k - $8k a month. Over 250M (20Y), it adds up to $500k to $2000k
-- stocks are high risk high return.
i think the stereotypical retail investors would consider stocks only for growth, not passive income. To them, a stock is either high return or nothing. They hear about dividend investors' stories, and also value-investing, but most of them decide to focus on high growth stocks.

Kun.H said "dividend is a secondary attraction/motivation." The main reason to consider any stock is invariably capital appreciation, hopefully a windfall. Kun is more intellectual and more analytical than other retail investors. His comments are articulate.Â 

Tian Jue said many investors have a reasonable, human desire beyond stable, dependable dividend. I guess it's a higher desire for ... windfall profit. I guess it's similar to higher desires like lottery, bigger home, top college,,,,, These higher desires drive up valuation to unreasonable levels.

Because these desires are based mostly on emotion, they can become irrational. Compare to Vallue investing.

Consider investing $500 into 25 growth stocks. To support firewall and buy-n-forget, I would need to limit each position to below $20.
Beware of the risk of temptation like tasty foods.

Last time was eq mufu. In hindsight, I didn't learn a lot. Actually, I was not able to. The mufu funds are almost opaque and rigid. I couldn't follow my views on individual companies. 

-- I guess ETFs mostly invest in popular stocks. 
The steady increase in ETF participation probably leads to more concentration more gravitation to the big index-component stocks. 
As ETFs become increasingly popular vis-a-vis stock-picking, the popular stocks probably receive even more mindshare and volume than before. 
These hot stocks probably become more volatile due to retail hot money.

-- fuxi or new: %% favorate assets=seldom very-mainstream
I shun SG condos. I favor SEA emerging market rEstate.
I shun growth stocks. My dividend stocks are supposed to be mainstream among retirees, but my cohort are not retirees and I don't know anyone interested in my low-growth dividend stocks.
I favor a large number of often unknown stocks.
I shun new HDB flats.

I have repeatedly halved my mufu allocation. Mufu is probably more mainstream than stock-picking

t-spend on burn rate Control
is my monthly exp recon too time-consuming?

need4reflect?
the time spent on burn rate control (including exp recon) is rather high, perhaps higher than parenting analysis, QQ..
However, this t-spend is among the most practical, fruitful and time-honored.

I think most oridnary folks don't have my level of patience, interest, determination.

Remember that burn rate is among my top 5 unique strengths, my top 3 long-term livelihood shields, my top 5 cancer-stress relieves.. The huge value come at a high tCost.

-- jolt: correlation of psf and d2mrt is not so clear. 
I think the count of interested buyers for each unit is very small, unlike gold.
We rarely have 2 identical units only different in terms of d2mrt, unlike commodities.
