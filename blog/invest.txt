-- new: SRS
benefit: reduce chargeable income. marginal tax rate more likely 15% than 11.5%

SRS balance... can invest in gold, ETF@SGX, a few stocks@SGX. accrual 0.05% per year if not invested.

.. concerns
before 62, withdrawals will incur 5% early withdrawal penalty (no minimum). The other 95% will be considered assessable income

after 62. No penalty, 50% of the withdrawal amount goes into asessable income

.. simple plan: Assuming I still have high salary in the U.S. but not in SG:
Lock up 10k in 2020 to save $1.5k as cash payout. When not working in SG, withdraw $10k (up to 20k) and pay 5% penalty ($500).

If no investment return then the 10% gain would be too low to compensate for the loss of liquidity over the intervening years? 

I think I am likely to invest it, but for now, let's assume laziness and LGpp.

.. slightly bigger plan
before 62 I can withdraw around 20k/Y. I pay 5% early withdrawal penalty. The other 19k goes into assessible income and hopefully incur no tax.
after 62 I can withdrawl up to 40k/Y. Half of it will be assessable income to IRAS. 20k chargeable will incur 0 tax

CPF top-up is an alternative, but more severe liquidity constraint
