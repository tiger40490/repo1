-- update blogpost on stock picking distractions
I once spent tons of hours on FSM cherry-picking but underwhelming ROTI

Stock picking analysis? I did that for a while on Robinhood. Not impressive

Just reading the newspapers alone would take lots of mental energy

-- I feel value investing requires absorbency and is not for everyone. 
Picking undervalued stocks using so much data is a tedious job, and you may be in a way competing with some "strong" players who analyze the same data.

--update : ffree ^ envy+FOMO
Other people's envy is the damper of my bare-bones ffree.
If we don't compare to the (wrong) peer group we can feel pretty comfortable and carefree. So why do we compare?

On one hand, minimum acceptable food cost is dropping and I have more than enough income to survive. On the other hand I feel lousy seeing my "peers" earning 10 times more than that minimum. Every one of them seems to complain about cost level.

Q: what's enough? Philip Che said $5k for a family of 4. Wife said 4-5k for my family of 4.

I'm confronting the paradox. In search of a rational perception, I have a chance to restore some balance.

I feel Theordore Rubin's books shed some light

-- I feel undervalued stocks are more visible than overseas properties.
I think properties in "famililar" cities still get less mindshare than undervalued stocks. 

Therefore, I feel the likelihood of finding an undervalued stock is lower.

-- new: moat
Economic moat is popularized by Buffett and is an element of (value) stock picking

-- update blogpost on SG inflation
For long-term burn rate management, inflation (along with medical) is one of the biggest concerns.

3% SG official inflation rate?
My own burn rate record-keeping is the most reliable and relevant data source
If we exclude flights, kids, bx, rental cost, then the "couple core burn rate" is showing very low inflation

In fact, I sense a deflation due to price reduction in food and clothing. Also electronics, flights, haircut show deflation.

long-term (30Y) prediction of inflation is unreliable. 3k/M burn rate growing by 100% over 20Y or 30Y is unreliable.

--new: cashcow^passive^nonwork income
"Cash cow" can be passive or active mgmt, but is reliable, not diminishing
"nonwork income" can be passive or active.

truly passive income beside my GRR: 
div stock is more passive than rental property active mgmt
rental income is the best inflation-proof passive income. Dividends are also effective.

In contrast, insurance products don't provide good inflation protection.

-- keeping up with the Joneses
i once hoped that for most folks passive income would relieve bulk of the pressure of this modern life.
This hope was based on the universal observation that burn rate is the primary source of pressure in modern life. (See separate blogpost)

Now I feel burn rate is half the "stressor profile" in me and my peers. 
My non-work income is rising steadily to "close the gap", among other burn-rate relieves[1]. 
This rise has given me a precious lense that's rare among my peers. 
Through this lense I find peer comparison as a chronic, pervasive source of pressure. You can call it keeping up with the Joneses.

[1] Also shield plans, stable inflation, well-managed healthcare cost,,,

If (consider Raymond) I had consistent $6k/M nonwork income, I would still feel the peer pressure. I must accept a simpler lifestyle than the peers' lifestyle
* without vacations to Europe, Japan
* without latest smartphones
* smaller home, in an average school district
* small cars
* fewer yoga classes
* less dining out

I think this tunnel vision ignores some fundamental factors such as
* health and wellness
* family harmony
* lifetime income
* career longevity

--new: ffree: j4 peer-comparison analysis
aboutOth

Q: Why writing so many blogposts comparing my ffree with peers?
A: since my teenage years I have observed the vast majority of adults (99% of the people around me), and witnessed their struggle and stress, and later experienced the same myself. 
Since 2017 I started seeing some reasons to feel free -- surreal. It demands a clarification. 

There are a few /identifiable/ differences (btw me and peers) not only in attitude but in the actual cashflow situation 

Another j4 this comparative analysis -- FOMO esp. due to brank (a lost game)

A secondary j4 -- rationalize my U.S. housing decision. The mainstream choice is a $800k school district home.


--new: bare-bones ffree=far from carefree

--fuxi: The most wasteful small purchases:
* basketball -- bought four so far. But there are many less visible wastes.
* board games, legos
* toys
* boy's stationeries
* kitchen utensils

Given these decisions are made consciously each time, they are much better than the invisible wastes.

Given the small sums, these wastes don't really threaten my bare-bones ffree, but they are fundamentally related to my views on deprivation, lavish etc

More damaging is buying harmful foods. We not only waste money, but also harm our health.

.. now some of the best small spends below ..
group workout
cheap exercise equipment
fancy fruits
salads
fancy dressing for raw reg
smoothie + chia
congee + chia

--sugg: consider investing CPF-OA balance into U.S. stocks
Should be able to beat 3.5%
no guilt no hurry

* If recreational amount, then too much tcost.
* If 20k, then I need to convince myself to take the plunge. I would say that long term prospect is good.
AT&T is good
