--Raymond on retirement destinations
Raymond plans to stay rented in A then B then C for a year each time, perhaps including China.

Healthcare is key. If not so healthy, then better stay near home base i.e. sg.

--SRS account in DBS/posb
$15,300/Y max deposit into this account as tax exempt income. Tax saving of more than $2.4k/Y 
After 5Y (say 2030) can withdraw as 2030 income but my tax bracket in 2030 would be the lowest, because first 40k in 2030 is not taxed in Singapore.

Before 2030, During the 5Y lock-in, withdrawal penalty is 5%. Without withdrawal, we can freely invest the SRS balance into FSM not stocks.

better deposit close to end of the tax year, so most of the year I enjoy the liquidity.

Also invest some cpf OA balance into FSM

--some bargains for my long-term cashflow
* bike
* yoga classes .. used to cost me $150/M. Now I see it as $15/session
* healthy foods like raw veg, fruits
* new laptops

--for my barebones ffree set-up, One of the biggest uncertainties is predictability of in/out cash-flow . 
Every investment has uncertainties aka risks. 
Experienced investors often categorize dozens of known risks into some 5 categories. 
The grouping is mostly conceptual and arbitrary.

As Wallace Xu said, rental prop mgmt probably needs the owner to stay local and learn the legwork.

--this 4D3N experience living in BGC is a immersion training / dress rehearsal / internship for a MY retirement.

Now I think MY retirement plan is based on logical reasoning + insufficient facts. It has slightly fewer uncertainties due to proximity to Singapore.

I need friends and similar people (mostly Chinese) living in the same community.

--sound-bytes from ERE author
* favor free sight-seeing locations like walk/cycling in the natural
* small home is easier to maintain
* learn to live without car, even in U.S.
* learn to cook simple yet healthy. 
** Jack He singled out steaming; I like microwave
** raw veg
** fish is the best animal food -- not cheap but easy to cook

This author had a lot to say about "where to spend the time after retirement meaningfully" esp. if travel and grandchildren are out of the picture

--plan how to let grandpa pay for the maid cost
wait for them to arrive first.

--consider investing CPF-OA balance into U.S. 
Should be able to beat 2.5%
no guilt no hurry

* If recreational amount, then too much tcost.
* If 20k, then I need to convince myself to take the plunge. I would say that long term prospect is good.

--consider USD 5k into FX robot after earning Citi.NA bonus

--sugg: transfer some 5k from OA to SA just to live through it.
Ask CPF to compute the additional interest earned each year
Can do this during lunch break

--fuxi: I used to feel a pressure, an obligation to periodically review and adjust my portfolio. 

Now I feel robinhood and fsm portfolios are small so luckily I don't get hit by their interference with my life. 
I prefer to review them as recreation and only when free.

--fuxi: now I feel my FSM process is low-efficiency
slow selection
distraction
if I invest more, distraction would grow. 
If I invest less, the profit potential would remain low.. low roti. Just recreational investing.

Shall I control it so I invest bigger amounts provided I don't do anything during office hours. Perhaps set sms to wife's number

--fuxi: SG is a consumer city. Sooo many low-cost or high-cost "goods" including heavy marketing of overseas vacation destinations. I believe overseas vacations are very expensive, lavish and not worthwhile at all.

I need to stand my ground and accept only SEA destinations. No Japan please

--I need reliable history of the realized dividend yield for each stock
Robinhood doesn't provide it. Might be a good thing -- less distraction ...

--fuxi: For someone like Gary in his 30's, there are lots of upcoming big-ticket items weighing on the mind
* kids education -- easily USD 1M
* provide housing for children when they turn 25 or something. Nowadays China parents take up this extra responsibility because they feel their children are hopeless to save up enough by themselves.
* medical

Since there's no reliable estimates on these bit-ticket costs, they tend to feel their "worries/burdens" are real.

--(LG-oth)what to do with boy's 5k balance? a single FSM fund or keep as a reserve, while investing more fund from 108? transfer boy's SGD 5000.00 to wife's FSM? 

--fuxi: bgc is high maintenance; FX robot might be better. Both are affecting my laser-gun.

--fuxi:
Any high-return products not audited could be a vehicle for money laundering
The criminals are willing to pay a fee (say 22%) to wash their black money into white money. The 22% becomes profit for the investment firm so the firm can generate high return for retail investors like me.

--Ashish's INR CD 
convert SGD->INR, invest for 1Y for 7%, convert back to SGD.
cost: bank FX spread
risk: FX ~ 2% a year
tcost is very low. Just transfer $1k to Ashish
