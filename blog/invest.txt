if living with grandma in my 60's, then my burn rate would be higher by ... 1k?

--fuxi: 8% curent income, assumed by Shou is highly unrealistic.

Difference between 8% and 7% is huge if you rely on it as current income.

if the Cambodia developer were a prestigious builder operating in the U.S., offering their assets as a REIT, the GRR would be much lower, due to credibility. 

Credibility translates to higher demand and lower "discount" in the form of GRR.

--wife's allowance
1800 increased to 2500 due to maid
now should go back to 1800 but she has no salary. 
I will pay for all enrichments (perhaps $1k/m)

split 11k her-30/70-me so that she receives $1k/m during Jan to Nov

..11k transfer:
11k all to wife would require
$1k from 198 to 153
$10k from 108 -> 153, simultaneously recording 30k for gp
