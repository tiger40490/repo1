--wife still feels we need higher earning because we still feel the strain of parenting due to limited financial resources.

In the U.S. I would feel the strain of long commute.

Family will probably find our home small and old.

I could invest in renovation (comfort) rather than size (appreciation). 

--fuxi
I allow myself to feel superior about my burn rate and Fuller wealth, but I Donâ€™t want to fall into the trap of benchmarking with the high earners.

--fuxi: the BGC agency search is a valuable hard-lesson experience. I foresee I would have similar situations and requirements going forward.

--fuxi: Ashish's INR CD 
convert SGD->INR, invest for 1Y for 7%, convert back to SGD.
cost: bank FX spread
risk: FX ~ 2% a year
tcost is very low. Just transfer $1k to Ashish

--sugg: consider investing CPF-OA balance into U.S. 
Should be able to beat 2.5%
no guilt no hurry

* If recreational amount, then too much tcost.
* If 20k, then I need to convince myself to take the plunge. I would say that long term prospect is good.

--sugg: transfer some 1k from OA to SA just to live through it.
Ask CPF to compute the additional interest earned each year
Can do this during lunch break
