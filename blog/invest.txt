To prevent /lifestyle creep/ and to give you the cashflow you need to invest towards your retirement goals, you need to set and commit to a budget. A popular rule-of-thumb would be to save or invest 20% of your income, leaving 50% for necessities and 30% for non-essential spending like shopping trips and dining out.

"Lifestyle creep" is a useful short phrase, further explained in a related  article https://www.syfe.com/magazine/your-30s-are-the-best-time-to-build-wealth-these-5-things-will-get-you-there/

--new: covid19 $handout: family burn rate #bare-bones
covid19 rescue budgets by the rich nations often feature a one-time cash handout up to $3k/family.

This figure suggests a bare-bones monthly family burn rate of $1k/family. 

To the authorities, realistic median family burn rate is estimated at well below 5k/M. That median is an unknown quantity we have to estimate. Even a 3k/M burn rate estimate would render the handout amount as useless as a drop in a bucket.

Not completely irrational. There are rational reasons, perhaps subconscious.

--update blogpost on MYS
It takes lots of time to try out retirement locations in MYS. 

There's a growing likelihood that we would retire in SG. In such a scenarios, we would only explore MYS for economical (long) vacation (like 1-12M) so we would try it out right before we retire, not now.

My favorite -- reliable current income on top of stable (ideally protected) NAV

Shop units (offices, hotels..) are the first asset class to meet the above criteria. Now I feel dividend cashcow stocks are somewhat similar. To understand this asset class, we must compare it to those rockstar tech stocks.

* dividend stocks are usually less glamourous partly because they don't show fast or windfall appreciation 
* my favorite dividend stocks are usually household names, just as the rockstars. 
* Unlike commercial properties, dividend stocks do fluctuate in valuation. This means buying at low price is more "possible" than in real estates
* credit risk is higher with properties because dividend aristocrats are known to keep paying.
