Fact: thanks to globalization, food and clothing cost is reducing world wide, so is the minimum cost of living (at least in SG)

Q: but why is our monthly burn rate not reducing?
A: I would say as a bachelor, my burn rate is probably lower than before, but as a family, we all want the same level of "pleasure" as our neighbors.
We FEEL impoverished and deprived if we only consume at the same level as 10Y ago (which has become cheaper than 10Y ago)

This question has implications on FIRE and bare-bones ffree

--new: barebones burn rate during retirement
Conceptually, assuming $0 accomodation, barebones monthly burn rate would be 50% allocated to food. I would say SGD 500 out of SGD 1k.

food + public transport + public utilities would be 2/3 of that burn rate.

Wildcard is healthcare. In Singapore, outpatient cost might be $50-$100/month

Across developed countries, food cost is rather low relative to income. Public transport and utilities are supposed to be provided at low cost. 

--update blogpost on deprivation
wife, as a mainstream consumer, wants to feel affordability when considering some everyday "lifestyle" spend like a toy, food, home fixture...

If her friends can afford something, but I tell her "not necessary", she would feel deprived.

To me these "lifestyle" items are all unnecessary, but I'm no purist.... 

At my abstinence level, my projected family burn rate is 3k. At wife's spending level, it is probably 3k additional, due to
* travel and dining
* personal items

She wants freedom to spend any way she wants, without asking for approval.

I kind of believe I can be comfortable with, say, 5k burn rate, but for her, the 'comfortable' level is possibly 10k. The ERE author is much lower.

--wife's allowance
make your wife feels that she could spend her money any way she wants. The 100k is her money just like her own salary. 

Trust that she won't overspend. She is not a teenager.

1800 increased to 2500 due to maid
now should go back to 1800 but she has no salary. 
I will pay for all enrichments (perhaps $1k/m)

Clawback $700 for Jan allowance.

Point of future adjustment -- monthly allowance

--involve boy in FSM investment analysis and decision
This is more realistic, applied math
