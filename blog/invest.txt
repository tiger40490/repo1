peak usd 127.946 after discount

PeakRetail is around SGD 1k psf
Flatiron is SGD 766 psf

--10Y GRR 82% over 10 years. #before taxes, 5% 6% ... 14%
10Y GRR is quarterly bank deposit
current office space rental yield is 7-8%, lower than shops

--MIH 
Ascott is the manager for the hotel portion only
Grade-A offices are managed by MIH

Skylar 5Y GRR paid since 2018
Ascott partnership since 2017

Flatiron, AsiaProperties and Energy12 are high yield bonds that could default like Majestic Village.

--new: reliability ranking of passive incomes
As mentioned in other bloposts, seeking 100% reliability is futile, disappointing, ,,
CPF Life
HDB rental -- I know the market, the location, currency
divdidend stocks
PeakRetail -- CapitalLand, currency, asset-country risk
BridgeRetail --  
MIH -- grade-A office has lower rental yield than shops; less mature location
BGC rental -- currency, asset-country risk

--new: inflation eroading GRR^windfall
GRR hates inflation, but property appreciation is often boosted by inflation.

Worst scenario -- inflation hits GRR, but somehow doesn't lead to property appreciation. How likely? 

--new: default risks affecting passive incomes
I think even an AA bond has a non-zero risk of default.

A junk bond has a higher risk, but still below 5% probability. 

My PeakRetail probably has a higher credit rating. BridgeRetail is slightly lower. Flatiron’s credit rating is mostly due to Ascott.

My Ritz junk bond did default.

Energy12 has a low credit rating.

..protections:
protection: health and in-demand skills
Protection: diversify the passive incomes
Protection: CPF Life
protection: HDB rental
protection: BGC rental

--GRR should not be perceived as guaranteed like cpf-Life
In my ffree projection, it's dangerously naive to treat GRR as guaranteed like cpf-Life.
We need to factor in the credit risk and market risk.

--fuxi: 
4% title fees for both PeakRetail and Flatiron

--fuxi: wife still feels we need higher earning because we still feel the strain of parenting due to limited financial resources.

In the U.S. I could feel the strain of long commute.

Family will probably find our home small and old. I would invest in renovation (comfort) rather than size (appreciation). We are lucky to be used to a small home.

--fuxi
I allow myself to feel superior about my burn rate and Fuller wealth, but I Don’t want to fall into the trap of benchmarking with the high earners.

--fuxi: Ashish's INR CD 
convert SGD->INR, invest for 1Y for 7%, convert back to SGD.
cost: bank FX spread
risk: FX ~ 2% a year
tcost is very low. Just transfer $1k to Ashish

--sugg: consider investing CPF-OA balance into U.S. 
Should be able to beat 3.5%
no guilt no hurry

* If recreational amount, then too much tcost.
* If 20k, then I need to convince myself to take the plunge. I would say that long term prospect is good.

--sugg: transfer some 1k from OA to SA just to live through it.
Ask CPF to compute the additional interest earned each year
Can do this during lunch break
