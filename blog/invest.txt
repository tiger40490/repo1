After moving to Becky Ma's place at Boston beside Tuft's hospital, I predicted it would be the best rental home for us ever.

Now I predict that the current Hib19 carefree ezlife is the best ever, due to brbr and other things.

-- first state div advantage: Rebecca said this fund can hold long-term.
If I put in 10k and hold 20Y, then it's kinda reward for her work

-- again and again, I'm facing the same dilemma:
if each decision is 20k+, then risk of mistake feels unbearable.
If each decision is 1k-, then I feel the oth, obsession.

Can we strike a balance? I think we need to be confident.

.. case: properties
.. case: T:US: I think we can sink in large amounts like 3k due to my prev xp
.. case: SIA: due to the commission, I think we should commit 7k+ from SRS
.. case: divAdv fund. Thanks to my prev xp I think we can commit 5k, perhaps from SRS
.. case: gold: thanks to my extensive analysis and due to the large bid/ask spread, i think we can commit bigger amounts like 3K+
