After we relocate to U.S. we will have some SGD reserve, growing thanks to rental income. What use do we have? No idea. 
* perhaps as wife's reserve. I think she prefers SGD
* perhaps to top up CPF 
* Perhaps to hedge against USD devaluation. 
* Perhaps convert to USD to invest in US or Asia.

Until the relocation, I think my USD would be in surplus. 

Any property big buy is likely in USD, but unlikely in SG 

However, when USD is on the rise, I have a chance to gain "access" to it by converting to SGD. Worst case it goes up further and never comes down, so i would put my surplus SGD into CPF at age 55.

Leaving USD bank notes at home is not ideal

Many fellow parents (plan to) spend so much on their kids because .. they want to. Chinese parents feel good about martyrdom -- saving up and spending it on kids education. However, Some (33 to 50%) of my peers appear to be under pressure to spend such huge amounts, due to peer pressure and societal expectation like a "norm".

How am I different?
I don't plan to spend on branded college, so there's a 50/50 chance I won't start saving until 4Y before college
I don't want to spend on luxury vacations as an "education" -- unnecessary and too costly
I do consider taking lower jobs to spend more time with kids.
I plan to spend on kids' non-academic pursuits, as Jenny on swimming

--new blogpost: %%peers' burn rate: y higher
I discussed with grandpa about a huge difference between me and my colleagues' burn rates. 
This difference is rooted in their long-term optimism about their earning growth and stock market returns. 

(In contrast, my self-confidence about my salary sustainability is based on IV.)

One thing easy and really useful to do with money matters is break-down analysis. 
I can see my younger (and some in 40's) colleagues spending more than I do on food, rent, mortgage, car, vacations, entertainment, gadgets, kids' enrichment .. 
These are often big-ticket items or creature-comfort spending and clearly luxury IMO

Many believe food is never a big ticket item, but I think they spend $40/D i.e. $15k/Y vs my 4k/Y.

Note I can't (allow myself to) cut further down below my peers because my family would then feel deprived.

--update blogpost on 
Again, why my peers don't feel ffree
* For their USD 90k burn rate without company health benefit, at 4% reliable return, they need 2.25M invested.
* For my SGD 40k burn rate with medishield, at 6% rental yield, I only need SGD 700k invested

My advantages are 1) burn rate 2) yield
