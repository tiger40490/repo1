-- I feel value-investing requires absorbency and is not for everyone. 
Picking undervalued stocks using so much data is a tedious job, and you may be in a way competing with some "strong" players who analyze the same data.

-- I feel undervalued stocks are 10 times more visible than overseas properties.
I think properties in "familiar" cities still get less mindshare than the most obscrue undervalued stocks. 

Thousands of automated systems collect, compare, disseminate financial data on All stocks. If there's some hidden gem in an undervalued stock, it won't stay unnoticed.

Therefore, I feel the likelihood of finding an undervalued stock is lower.

Economic moat is popularized by Buffett and is an element of (value) stock picking

--new: big ticket spends of FOMO
update blogpost on ffree^fomo

If I benchmark with those earning 200k, my wife and kids would want vacations to Japan, Europe.

They would want a bigger home. I can accept a small home, but prime location!

They might want a brand new car, not pre-owned.

Wife would want a top school district.

When I tell them "not necessary", they might feel impoverished? Not sure.

It could be useful to zoom into the biggest discretionary spends. 

Figures below are monthly outlays.
.. USD 5k/M mortgage + prop tax. USD 4k-6k
.. USD 2k/M/child private school 
.. USD 1k/M private car. Figure is total cost, depends on usage
.. USD 1k/M/child enrichments. Figure varies a lot.

--new: keeping up with the Joneses #FOMO
i once hoped that, for most folks, passive income would relieve bulk of the pressure of this modern life.
This hope was based on the universal observation that burn rate is the primary source of pressure in modern life. (See separate blogpost)
Now I feel burn rate is half the "stressor profile" in me and my peers. 
My non-work income is rising steadily to "close the gap", with the help of other burn-rate relieves, such as shield plans, stable inflation, well-managed healthcare cost, robust rental demand,,

This rise has given me a precious lense that's rare among my peers. 
Through this lense I find peer comparison as a chronic, pervasive source of pressure. You can call it keeping up with the Joneses.

Note non-work income does cushion the impact of PIP...

If (consider Raymond) I had a consistent $6k/M nonwork income + zero salary, I would still feel impoverished, mostly due to peer pressure.

Better accept a simpler lifestyle than the peers' lifestyle
* without vacations to Europe, Japan
* without latest smartphones
* smaller home, in an average school district
* small cars
* fewer yoga classes

I think this tunnel vision ignores some fundamental factors such as
* health and wellness
* family harmony
* lifetime income
* career longevity

--fuxi: The most wasteful small purchases:
* basketball -- bought four so far. But there are many less visible wastes.
* board games, legos
* toys
* boy's stationeries
* kitchen utensils

Given these decisions are made consciously each time, they are much better than the invisible wastes.

Given the small sums, these wastes don't really threaten my bare-bones ffree, but they are fundamentally related to my views on deprivation, lavish etc

More damaging is buying harmful foods. We not only waste money, but also harm our health.

.. now some of the best small spends below ..
group workout
cheap exercise equipment
fancy fruits
salads
fancy dressing for raw reg
smoothie + chia
congee + chia

Should be able to beat 3.5%

* If recreational amount, then too much tcost.
* If 20k, then I need to convince myself to take the plunge. I would say that long term prospect is good.
AT&T is good
