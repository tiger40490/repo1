If you don't prepare in advance, can you cope with ths burn rate?

It would require a savings rate of 60k+/Y. If you receive 30k nonwork income, then it would help.

When I told him that I would try to think less of the bonus amount, he pointed out his 30k+ annual burn rate. Clearly this amount is quite heavy for him.

t-spend on burn rate Control
jolt
is my monthly exp recon too time-consuming?

In terms of ROTI, monthly exp recon beats investment analysis in stocks and funds. 

need4reflect?
the time spent on burn rate control (including exp recon) is rather high, perhaps higher than parenting analysis, QQ..
However, this t-spend is among the most practical, fruitful and time-honored.

I think most oridnary folks don't have my level of patience, interest, determination.

Remember that burn rate is among my top 5 unique strengths, my top 3 long-term livelihood shields, my top 5 cancer-stress relieves.. The huge value come at a high tCost.

--update blogpost on exp recon (https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=13923&action=edit)

.. annual budgets? I have two alternatives.
1) I tend to have a long-term savings target i.e. what share of my salary (eg 100k) is saved to banks or invested. Not exactly a savings target, I have a spreadsheet tracking couple's NAV.

2) I tend to rely on my expense recon. One practical value is setting an expectation for the "outlays over next 3M". As such, expense recon largely displaces annual budget.

In theory, it's useful to set a simple, single number as the annual budget excluding investments, but in reality, it's time consuming to separate out investments, transfers etc.

--no blog Q: shall I increase number of FSM holdings but keep each amount low?
I used to have that but then I sold most of them to simplify my life. They do become a distraction.

As recreation investing, they are less distractive than stocks.

--fuxi: contingency cash reserve
How much is reasonable?
Park where? DBM multipler? No
FSM? 

-- fuxi: CDY is not a valuable criteria because
price can change fast, invalidating the CDY figure, due to SnD
div amount can change (dramatically) next quarter due to profit and management 

Instead I would focus more on DYOC, dividend stability.

-- fuxi: Cambodia and BGC rEstate mkt: both driven by Chinese hot money
--fuxi: terminate dbs ccard 3M after confirming the end of multiplier bonus? Terminate to keep my life simpler.
also transfer most of the fund to FSM, but keep the multipler account as just another bank account.

-- tanko vs HF.Sun
I can tell both feel the pressure of livelihood (with/out kids). Both are suffering from workload, work stress, work life balance.

i feel tanko doesn't want to but feels pressured to work into old age, until he feels he has saved enough.
He doesn't believe in cpf-life providing sufficient cash payout for his golden years. I won't bother to ask him why.

In contrast, I feel confident to stop working any time but I choose to work full time till my 70's and possibly part-time till my 80's.

--new: Y few peers adopt my investment principles #Tanko
I told Tanko about my principles:

1) focus on cash payout rate around 6% as current income. I have a blogpost on 6% being the highest realistic return for long-term, but that's a return rate. A payout rate of 6% is much harder.
2) decent prospect of principal preservation over a 10Y horizon, worst case 20Y to recover 
3) Resist the temptation of windfall. Maintain a healthy detachment.

Note #2 is a personal conviction, because most of my chosen assets are actually illiquid without real time mark-to-market.

Q: why so few people in my cohort follow similar principles. 
A(Tanko): many don't have enough free cash like 500k (Tanko's figure). I guess many have oversized property assets paying out very little (or negative) DYOC -- i.e. non-productive assets
A(Tanko): many investors prefer to see their 500k (if available) staying safe in a bank account, rather than fluctuating in an investment account.
A(I told Tanko): a fundamental reason is that dividend yield is widely seen as insignificant compared to windfall.

-- correlation of psf and d2mrt is not so clear. 
I think the count of interested buyers for each unit is very small, unlike gold.
We rarely have 2 identical units only different in terms of d2mrt, unlike commodities.

-- financial health of wq.l
bought a 120sqm home for 750k. 30Y mtg, serviced entirely by CPF. When there's surplus CPF balance, they would pay down the mtg.

School costs are very low (until college). Kids' clothing cost is low accoring to him. The burden of parenting is mostly energy/time, not financial. This is stark contrast to the mainstream perception "raising one more kid in Singapore possibly costs more than a $1million."

A telltale sign of his strain -- WQ.l feels college cost would be much higher, even with the subsidies and student loans. Even before that phase, Tanko may say that unplanned events could derail their low-cost lifestyle for the next few years.

I think they are a frugal family. I think the mother has to go out and earn a salary.

No property investment. No tuition.

-- new deliverymen's brbr #free agent
t_fomo^livelihood t_jolt
(This blogpost is mostly about finance..)

[a=at or above my idea of barebones livelihood, something of a luxury]

looking at the deliverymen and Uber drivers I think these free agents have to work relatively long hours in reality.

What if he only needs to work a minimum of 0-4 hours a day, as extra hours become leisure? 

(As with Tanko's brothers) Let's further assume _basic_ healthcare, housing and education are provided by government. 

Q: Is this (comparable to my) carefree ezlife, based on excellent brbr? 

His burn rate would be much lower than his cohort, as he rejects FOMO such as
* [a] top schools
* [a] big car, or any car
* [a] overseas vacations. The low-income, big families tend to prefer staycation
* [a] restaurants

[a] I would say these are luxury items unnecessary for a happy fulfilling life on earth. 

Q: How is his lifestyle different from FIRE?
A: nonwork income like investment payout is instrumental to FIRE. Note long-horizon windfall profit doesn't help.
A: FIRE is about removing depednency on salary. The deliveryman still needs salary to make ends meet.

Q: How does his lifestyle compare to the Khmer villagers?
A: [!a] healthcare, [!a] edu, [!a] housing provisions, even [!a] food security is not great in today's Cambodia.

Q: how is XH.Fu's life different with 2 kids and lots of free time?
A: I think XH's income is comparable to (not lower than) his cohort. XH trades [a] job security for abundance of free time.

Actually the free agents enjoy limited job security, and worry about sudden job loss, sick leave, medical bills etc.

Q (side question): with his spare time, does he adopt a healthier lifestyle than his cohort?
A: I think most adults have just enough leisure time to lead a healthier life, so time is a factor but not a limiting factor. Motivation is the real limiting factor.

--update blogpost on brbr
barber's 压力 is presumably brbr. If they earn 2k and spend only $500, then no ground for complaint.

FOMO is probably another factor. The essential needs are probably $500/M
