--update Tianjue.Lin blogpost
In my younger days, I had to put in consistent effort over decades to improve my status for the mating competition.  When I first had kids, I didn't believe the experience of the likes of WQ.Luo. I was driven to improve my housing, engage in the arms race with other parents.

Simiarly, the inflation fear was a widespread brainwash.

Medical cost inflation fear was driven by my own parents...

Therefore, I felt perhaps $3M would be needed. Those around me who gave up on ffree were seen as _quitters_.

-- update "ffree is a state of mind"
What's the real difference between me and my cohort in terms of ffree ?

I record/reconcile my burn rate over decades, and have high confidence in my forecast.
I have a reliable nonwork income in cpfLife and HDB rental, not counting other rental properties.
I say and feel I can stop working any time .. Statement 1
I say both parents can stop working indefinitely (and my family can live a reasonable, comfortable life) .. Statement 2. 
I sometimes say that I have more money than I need for my lifetime .. Statement 3. 
^^^ My circle of a few dozen friends never say these things. Am I serious? Yes. I didn't say what kind of family lifestyle Statement 2/3 entail. 

I often feel free to (and actually did) choose lower jobs. I don't think many in my cohort feel that same level of freedom.

I have no worries about medical, retirement income, long-term inflation. I think many of my cohort are not so care-free. These are big components of long-term ffree.

--new: index investing relies on the index-admin as stock-picker
I think US index funds show far better returns than other regional indices. When we say mutual funds can't beat the index, we only mean the U.S. broad indices.

The admin of the indices are the real stock pickers and portfolio managers for those passive funds. 

-- new: which aspiration is not LG2
So far, all the blogposts on this broad topic (..) have singled out aspirations that are non-consequential.

Branded college
SDXQ
Spacious home
Car ownership

Q: Is there one middle-class aspiration that I do subscribe to?
safe, conducive school? 
Safe, clean street? No. This is not just for middle-class

-- new or fuxi: Why ibanks "support" bccy
Ibank's advertized business model is client facilitation. 
Ibanks may hold an inventory of popular bccy, and may also accept service fee payment in bccy. In such a scenario, the ibank would trade bccy for its own position, even though the claim to trade bccy only for hedging. 

In other words, ibanks are dealers rather than pure-play brokers.

Prop trading is a secret business model of ibanks.

Canada is an attractive emigration destination due to healthcare. However, the Singapore integrated shield basically provides a comparable healthcare.
