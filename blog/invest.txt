Top schools (in all countries), top colleges (esp. medical-school education), private tuition, enrichment programs... can be considered as luxuries that lower middle class (like me) can't afford easily. I would have to struggle, sacrifice, endure a lot to afford them

My barebones ffree is insufficient for this type of luxury.

Before college phase, I think luxury education could be 70% of the total budget. This luxury alone can derail my carefree life.

Similar experience -- the idea of a 700k home (with property tax + mortgage) became a threat to my cashflow carefree /position/, until I devised the lease-spread /idea/. 

-- consider putting USD 60k to FSM to earn higher interest, but tcost a bit too high?
Find out FSM interest rate

-- update blogpost on distraction
Robinhood proved very distractive. It became substance addiction similar to the wrong-time temptation

-- looking at Rahul, P.Mullins etc -- Capable but their minimum burn rate create a burden on their shoulders. 

I think the value-investing seminar audience also feel a similiar burden -- how to sustain my "BASIC" $8k/M family lifestyle if I don't want to work so hard for 30Y and then sustain the same beyond retirement? Problem is really the burn rate.

Am blessed with a frugal wife, SG citizenship ..
