* basketball -- bought four so far
* board games, legos
* toys
* boy's stationeries
* kitchen utensils

Given these decisions are made consciously each time, they are much better than the invisible wastes.

Given the small sums, these wastes don't really threaten my bare-bones ffree, but they are fundamentally related to my views on deprivation, lavish etc

More damaging is buying harmful foods. We not only waste money, but also harm our health.

group workout
cheap exercise equipment
fancy fruits
salads
fancy dressing for raw reg
smoothie + chia
congee + chia

--sugg: consider investing CPF-OA balance into U.S. stocks
Should be able to beat 3.5%
no guilt no hurry

* If recreational amount, then too much tcost.

I think IRS interest rate is low (like 3%), so I don't mind owing them.
