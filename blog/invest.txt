car ownership in old age -- (not based on data) feels like dangerous and high maintenance

--new: med^tax rate: SG,US,, 
U.S. healthcare is more expensive than Canada bit tax is lower.

However, SG is superior in both tax rate (much lower) and healthcare cost (lower).

--high-div sectors: oil, telco, motor,

-- G3 criteria for small buys

* dining at a known place is prudent
* dining at a fancy new restaurant? High chance of overspend

Not completely irrational. There are rational reasons, perhaps subconscious.

--update blogpost on MYS
It takes lots of time to try out retirement locations in MYS. 

There's a growing likelihood that we would retire in SG. In such a scenarios, we would only explore MYS for economical (long) vacation (like 1-12M) so we would try it out right before we retire, not now.

My favorite -- reliable current income on top of stable (ideally protected) NAV

Shop units (offices, hotels..) are the first asset class to meet the above criteria. Now I feel dividend cashcow stocks are somewhat similar. To understand this asset class, we must compare it to those rockstar tech stocks.

* dividend stocks are usually less glamourous partly because they don't show fast or windfall appreciation 
* my favorite dividend stocks are usually household names, just as the rockstars. 
* Unlike commercial properties, dividend stocks do fluctuate in valuation. This means buying at low price is more "possible" than in real estates
* credit risk is higher with properties because dividend aristocrats are known to keep paying.
