I said most of my friends invest in u.s. index funds. xh.fu felt approved of it

XH felt $2M asset would support a comfortable burn rate. I said that's too hard for most people. However, I think he is not obsessed and fixated on that target... fortunately for him.

I still believe that on the secondary market, stocks and bonds generate income out of thin air.

For stocks, there's also a general trend of long-term appreciation. We can use official closing price as a fair valuation.

I believe options, swaps and futures do not have such trends and therefore zero-sum. I would say for all of these derivatives, there's no income generated out of thin air like bond coupons.

How about physical gold coin? If you keep it at home for 50Y, then it is likely to appreciate. This likelihood is the same if the gold coin changes hands over the 50Y. Therefore, trading gold is not zero-sum game.

If, hypothetically, the bond coupon is so low as to be wiped out by transactino costs, then between the buyer and seller, this is a zero-sum game.

CSY's son has a 60k/Y college fee (similar to Ivy League). 50% paid by parents i.e. 2500/M. With that burn rate, my idea of  "lower stress, lower pay" easy job is impractical.

Retirement country's economy is a crucial factor.
My parents are receiving increasing pension. The China system is showing no risk of bankruptcy.

SG's system is mostly based on self-contribution, but the government invests the cpf fund to generate decent return for us. The SGD's strength is based on the local economy.

U.S. system appears to be broken. The social security money we contributed are pooled and distributed based on needs, not based on contribution :(
