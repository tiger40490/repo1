--now I feel the FSM process is poor efficiency
slow selection
distraction
if I invest more, distraction would grow. 
If I invest less, the profit potential would remain low.. low roti. Just recreational investing.

without going to BGC, I doubt Chun Tih would do anything. But better confirm with him before going

--new Q: what's the best use of additional 100k (assuming you can't invest it)?
I will consider
* lower-paying job with more satisfaction
* more frq visits with grandparents
* vacations at nearby locations. There are plenty of world class yet low-cost destinations in SEA and China. No Japan no Korea please -- luxury and unnecessary. Our family life isn't less complete without them.

Many fellow parents (plan to) spend disproportionately on their kids because .. they want-to not pressured-to. Chinese parents feel good about martyrdom -- saving up and investing on kids education. 

Labor of love... However, Some (33 to 50%) of my peers appear to be under pressure to put up such huge amounts, due to peer pressure and societal expectation like a "norm".

How am I different?
I don't plan to spend on branded college, so there's a 50/50 chance I won't start saving until 4Y before college
I don't want to spend on luxury vacations as an "education" -- unnecessary and too costly
I do consider taking lower jobs to spend more time with kids.
I plan to spend on kids' non-academic pursuits, as Jenny on swimming, piano, coding, camps

Q: prediction: my visible burn rate with mindchamps without tax without air-tickets? 5k, excluding anything from wife's account
saving rate target after allowance payout: 5k. Be kind to yourself. 

Both targets are useful and valuable. but we need different attitudes towards each.

I'm generally competent at saving but stress can still happen

i feel good not conceited about my burn rate + savings rate. Also proud of my passive income. This is a constant wellspring of positive feeling. Hopefully no attachment. 

I mention my ffree to many people and I start to feel positive about it, without losing my feet on the ground.

If we keep control over our burn rate, basic ffree is not unrealistic, largely thanks to medishield.

--after hibernation, need to keep paying medishield since I will need it when back in SG

--SG is a consumer city. Sooo many low-cost and high-cost "goods" including heavy marketing of overseas vacation destinations. I believe overseas vacations are very expensive, lavish and not worthwhile at all.

I need to stand my ground and accept only SEA destinations. No Japan please

--fuxi: 
in SG more than U.S., financial organizations assume everyone has a local smart phone. ...  major headache when I'm overseas !

--update blogpost: eg@SG gov service #retirement destination
* cpf retirement roadshow -- no such thing in the U.S.
* health promotion roadshows
* gov public service hot lines -- takes a few seconds to reach a live person
* renovated exercise corners in HDB estates
