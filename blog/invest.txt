Fact: thanks to globalization, food and clothing cost is reducing world wide, so is the minimum cost of living, at least in SG.

Q: but why is our monthly burn rate not reducing?
A: I would say as a bachelor, my burn rate is probably lower than before, but as a family, we all want the same level of "pleasure" as our neighbors. We FEEL impoverished and deprived if we only consume at the same level as 10Y ago (which has become cheaper than 10Y ago)

This question has implications on FIRE and bare-bones ffree.

Wife, as a mainstream consumer, wants to feel "affordable" when considering certain everyday "lifestyle" spend like a toy, personal care, home fixture, fancy food... 
If her friends can afford something, but I tell her "not necessary", she would feel deprived.
To me these "lifestyle" items are all unnecessary, but I'm no purist myself .... 

At my abstinence level, projected family burn rate is SGD 2k. In contrast, at wife's spending level, she told me 4-5k excluding housing, major medical and travel

She wants freedom to spend any way she wants, without asking for approval.

I kind of believe I can be truly *comfortable* at, say, 4k burn rate (excluding housing + major medical + college tuition), but for her, the 'comfortable' level is possibly 8k. The ERE author is much lower.
