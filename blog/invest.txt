Home upgrade is probably the best choice

In all cases below, mainstream preference is not an accurate reflection of my preference. It's crucial to honor my own preference (and wife's) rather than other people's preferences.

In overpriced markets, rental is relatively underpriced and represents a real bargain, but the Chinese has a deep preference for ownership and doesn't perceive the bargain as such.

How about sdxq homes? Poor bargain in terms of rental demand and commute
