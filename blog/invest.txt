There are many very strong and convincing blue-chips paying low CDY or unstable dividend amount. I hestitate as buy-n-forget is hard .. If price climbs then starts falling, I may be forced to babysit my position.

-- LZ.Yu and wife did a lot of cash->cpf top-up ..

-- LZ.Yu said he has only one salary + some small investment income. He emphasized the reliance on his savings. 
His wife can, if so desired, find a job.

-- LZ.Yu's wife said many times at least SGD 300k to complete NYU. But she said the  published figure by the university may not be enough.

my ffree is still barebones.

cash -> OA -> SA prevents people from wasting their hard-earned savings on wrong investments, including top schools.
--update blogpost on windfall
I asked only a few peer investors. I feel most of them are not only dreaming but aiming at a $500k windfall (often much higher), over 5-10Y. My wife might be one of them.

Q: So how much risk capital are they committing? 100k? 200k?

Q: is that level of return realistic? I guess only tech stocks can deliver 30%/Y compound return
I don't want to overthink this question, since it affects only them, not me.

Q: Did I ever try that and how did I decide to stop?
A: perhaps I was never so ambitious so hungry for windfall, after I become an investor. 

--new too much SGD?
cpf transfer?
convert to usd?

--fuxi: London home price
GBP 50k-100k is needed to buy an "average" home in London. Presumably, the down payment. I think this is higher than Singapore.

--update blogpost on MOETF
with ETF or mufu, I can't exclude a stock when I buy the fund. That stock could be too expensive, or low-yield or speculative.

If I were in charge of a fund, I might exclude 88% of theose stocks. Therefore, most of my money invested in the fund is not aligned to my personal needs, risk appetite and selection criteria.

t-spend on burn rate Control
jolt
is my monthly exp recon too time-consuming?

In terms of ROTI, monthly exp recon beats investment analysis in stocks and funds. 

need4reflect?
the time spent on burn rate control (including exp recon) is rather high, perhaps higher than parenting analysis, QQ..
However, this t-spend is among the most practical, fruitful and time-honored.

I think most oridnary folks don't have my level of patience, interest, determination.

Remember that burn rate is among my top 5 unique strengths, my top 3 long-term livelihood shields, my top 5 cancer-stress relieves.. The huge value come at a high tCost.

--no blog Q: shall I increase number of FSM holdings but keep each amount low?
I used to have that but then I sold most of them to simplify my life. They do become a distraction.

As recreation investing, they are less distractive than stocks.

--fuxi: terminate dbs ccard 3M after confirming the end of multiplier bonus? Terminate to keep my life simpler.

-- correlation of psf and d2mrt is not so clear. 
I think the count of interested buyers for each unit is very small, unlike gold.
We rarely have 2 identical units only different in terms of d2mrt, unlike commodities.

-- financial health of wq.l
bought a 120sqm home for 750k. 30Y mtg, serviced entirely by CPF. When there's surplus CPF balance, they would pay down the mtg.

School costs are very low (until college). Kids' clothing cost is low accoring to him. The burden of parenting is mostly energy/time, not financial. This is stark contrast to the mainstream perception "raising one more kid in Singapore possibly costs more than a $1million."

A telltale sign of his strain -- WQ.l feels college cost would be much higher, even with the subsidies and student loans. Even before that phase, Tanko may say that unplanned events could derail their low-cost lifestyle for the next few years.

I think they are a frugal family. I think the mother has to go out and earn a salary.

No property investment. No tuition.

--update blogpost on brbr
barber's 压力 is presumably brbr. If they earn 2k and spend only $500, then no ground for complaint.

FOMO is probably another factor. The essential needs are probably $500/M
