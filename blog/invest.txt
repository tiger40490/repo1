Even safe bond funds on FSM involve much higher effort than my Robinhood process.

* problem: the amounts are too large, tyically 10k. Sugg: reduce to 1k
* risk/diligence: when I sell, I have to stay alert and ensure I don't sell the wrong lot i.e. from the wrong account
* the profit has to be recorded in my exp recon s/s
* I check the PnL for each position too often. 
* my tolerance is too low for large cash balance. sugg: accept 30k cash balance in cash account

cpfLife ERS provides about $2200/M, considered adequate. I think this is a reasonable, sensible assessment. 

What if many of your cohort are building nest eggs to provide $10k/M of retirement income? Would you feel the pressure to match up? This pressure is comparable to the pressure to buy a SDXQ home [Orchard mansion]

.. Personal Training
At OneNorth, I visited a fitness center that only offers personal training. Minimum membership is $1800/12 PT sessions. If you work nearby and earn a decent salary, then you would probably consider this package.

Now, suppose many of your colleagues have signed up. They tell you various reasons. You accept some of those reasons, but overall unconvinced. Now you assess your choices. You could try jogging on the street near office (unappealing to me). You could do some simple workout in office, or at home. You could join a regular gym somewhere for $100/M.

I would say it's really important to justSayNo. Even if I earn 20k/M, this salary would decline in X years so I need to spend like ordinary locals and save. PT is unsustainable. Their business model (designed for the super rich) is unsuitable for the nearby office professionals.

Similar story on yoga centers membership and U.S. SDXQ homes which resemble Orchard mansions.

why I feel so effective, rewarding, satisfactory ... about my cash-flow, more so than wellness, work-life-balance, QQx, life-long learning...?

Reason: battery/accumulation is more effective in family finance than the other areas
I have gravitated towards C and SQL precisely due to accumulation.

Reason: less monitoring or refresh needed. I have my exp recon routine + cash pile mgmt strategies. In contrast, wellness, tech learning ... require on-going effort.

Reason: my numerical analytical advantage is clearer in personal-finance than most areas. QQ and coding drill are also similar.

It's crucial to be clear what exactly we want out of stock trading. Many valid priorities of other investors are not important to us. In fact, these OPPs (other people's priorities) may get in our way. 

* when you add those OPP, your life becomes more complicated, when it can be simpler like mine. You may have to babysit your positions. Your firewall is strained.
* when you add those OPP, your priority list would see some of your true priorities pushed down. Analog: carry-on luggage vs checked luggage.
* when you add those OPP, you may take on more risks.

when stock picking is an active recreation, then novelty becomes a non-trivial selection criteria. That favors international exotic names, and new names. 

However, I have bought a lot of high-yield names. The remaining names tend to be low-yield. Hard to find any suitable stocks.

-- slow-cooking new: high-yield, low growth, blue chips
T:US is probably a leading example.
Singtel is another well-known example.

How about the red chips? 
My view on gov red chips has changed. They seem to pay good dividends to compensate for very poor long-term trend.
Gary felt red chips are profitable businesses, but widely perceived as low efficiency, low margin.
U.S. dividend stocks offer better long-term prospect. The red chips don't qualify for my income ptf.

best China index
You can collect the count of tracking ETFs for each index. The most popular index is MSCI China.

Gary singled out FTSE A50.

Gary believed China ADR stocks are correlated with China index much more than SP500.

jolt: China is the growing economic superpower, rivaling U.S., but in terms of stocks potential, it lacks all of the power, trec, market support that's available in U.S. stocks.

SG, Germany, Australia ... also have strong, competitive economies but lack the same strengths of the U.S. stocks.

-- slow-cooking update livelihood blogs (S.Liu or Maslow)
[[Nomadland]] and many other movies and songs portray the livelihood pressures (even hardships) of ordinary people in relatively affluent locations (affluent as defined by global standard). For example, most Singaporeans would feel some livelihood pressure. 

For these individuals, my ezlife on the cash flow high ground is .. dream. 

I like mathematical criteria for that high ground, such as brbr, Fuller Wealth. By these criteria, my ezlife and my high ground are realistic for some of them, but they lack something to achieve the same.

So far, all the blogposts on this broad topic (..) have singled out aspirations that are non-consequential:

Branded college
SDXQ
Spacious home
Car ownership
..

Q: Is there one middle-class aspiration that I do subscribe to?
safe, conducive school? This is not just for middle-class
Safe, clean street? No. This is not just for middle-class

appreciation is slow in most locations. Don't believe agents who boast their appreciation potential.

Foreigner demand is dampened by ABSD, esp. in non-prime locations. These locations are mostly sold to local buyers.
