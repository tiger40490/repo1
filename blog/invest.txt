-- port liberty is inferior to newport in terms of connectivity ...

-- I have no time for frequent exp tracking but need to feel the outflow...Avoid card payment. 
However, need to carry less cash.... reduce mental load. Leave $50 in office drawer and $100 in home drawer, so carry $100 until I get used to it

--Q: our predicted burn rate with maid? 7k
Q: is it even constructive to set a target?
I usually need (and benefit from) certainty, control, clarity ... --> assurance and confidence, but it can take a lot of effort (I ended up doing it only twice a year) and generate some stress.

--Jill Lim? Leave it as i can't do nothing.

--too much SGD or USD?
After we relocate to U.S. we will have some SGD reserve, growing thanks to HDB rental income. What use do we have for this growing pile of SGD? 
* perhaps as wife's reserve. I think she prefers SGD
* perhaps to top up CPF 
* Perhaps to hedge against USD devaluation. 
* Perhaps convert to USD to invest in US or Asia.
* put my surplus SGD into CPF-life at age 55.

Until the relocation, I think my USD would be in surplus. 
However, any property big buy is likely in USD, but unlikely in SG

When USD is on the rise, I have a chance to gain "access" to it by converting to SGD. Worst case it goes up further and never comes down

--fuxi: ocbc 
young saver's account will have min balance only when meimei reaches 18

for ATM access, i will put my own money, not kid's money in this account.. Same as mayb. Alternatively, I can make do without ATM access.

--Q: what's the best use of additional 100k?
Some will actually spend it on fancy vacations
some will actually save it up to support top school districts or educational programs
I will consider
* lower-paying job with more satisfaction
* more time with grandparents

--new blogpost
Many fellow parents (plan to) spend so much on their kids because .. they want-to not pressured-to. Chinese parents feel good about martyrdom -- saving up and spending it on kids education. 

Labor of love... However, Some (33 to 50%) of my peers appear to be under pressure to spend such huge amounts, due to peer pressure and societal expectation like a "norm".

How am I different?
I don't plan to spend on branded college, so there's a 50/50 chance I won't start saving until 4Y before college
I don't want to spend on luxury vacations as an "education" -- unnecessary and too costly
I do consider taking lower jobs to spend more time with kids.
I plan to spend on kids' non-academic pursuits, as Jenny on swimming
