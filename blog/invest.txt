cashflow stress is the biggest livelihood stress for most people. FIRE discussions reinforce this common notion. I think it is only slightly exaggerated, like by 0.1%

family harmony, wellness ... can become more serious stressors.

FOMO/kiasu/exclub/vanity are common stressors but void, empty

If I receive $100k windfall right now (Not 5 years in the future), I might use it to improve my commute. For commute I feel current income is more effective than a windfall far out

If I receive $1m windfall, I would use it to strengthen my shields and relieve my anxieties.

For Mr Money Mustache, appparently the windfall doesn't mean anythig to him, but I doubt it.

Malaysia retirement remains an important backup option.
If feasible, then it is likely to reduce my crbr (couple retirement burn rate) by 20%.

My default crbr is SGD 3k. Housing is a $0 net cost. If I live in a remote outskirt of SG, then housing can be a net profit due to lease spread. Suppose it is 10% lower/better than default.

Malaysia retirement is a natural extension of outskirt SG. It should produce even better crbr and brbr. 

Remember, during retirement, brbr stil matters esp. if I descend to cash flow low ground.

-- fuxi: %%avg return rate
properties outperformed. Even without appreciation, the rental savings mean 4% net return
my unit trusts -- probably 2-4%
Private equity -- I managed to recover from a big loss (Airtropolic), so barely positive return overall

A rigorous calc would include unrealized pnl from mark-to-market, ...

I have a blogpost on the highest returns achieved. I think it's in compound

--fuxi: FCF and big investments
Some higih-earning individuals are unable to buy a home. I think my ex-colleagues Damien, Pinsky might be among them. I imagine they don't give it priority. 

They could pay a high rent (up to 40% of their income), take a car loan to drive an expensive car, ... basically spend 99% of their salary every year. It's never hard to find ways to spend money.

The high rent, of course, goes down the drain. 

Big investments don't necessarily require high brbr, but require savings i.e. FCF.

--t-budget for [[irrational exuberance]]?
Probably no impact on my investment decisions.

--new: too much cash saved for legacy
othRisk
My "challenge" in this blogpost is not having too little left for my kids, but having too much cash now, 50Y before my expected end of life. This is a minor challenge compared to all my other challenges.

Default plan is not donation but legacy to my 2 children and grandchildren (if I'm lucky). If something happens to them and my wife goes before me, then donation is an acceptable default.

Most important-yet-neglected factors within my control -- 1) longevity and career longevity 2) what my kids become. These controllable factors ought to be my focus.

Next, keep an eye on the long-horizon risks, beyond inflation. See my blogpost on "financial protections: powerless against some rare disasters"

Next question: what asset classes are suitable for holding long-term beyond 50Y.

If I have more confidence about holding long-term, then I can afford to take more risks. However, I hate long troughs (see the other blogpost)
* gold, 
stocks,

-- retirement destination
YJL said he would stay close to the child. I think it is actually practical. They can help out and also receive help when they are old.
For my wife and me, perhaps the more important criteria is job. I want to have a dev job till my 70's. Not likely in Singapore.
-- fuxi or update blogpost on brbr?
Compared to 2016, my burn rate is down by 2-3k, partly due to pre-school, airfare, ...

Now i feel $1k to $2k reduction in burn rate means a lot to my (brbr and) sense of confidence, peaceful leisure, wealth. I think this reveals a fundamental difference between me and my peers.

Exclub wealth? Not enhanced by brbr improvement.

--update blogpost on 3 likely derailers of current carefree easy life
My current carefree phase has lasted more than a year since late 2018. 

Q: what are the derailers observed so far, based on facts, not forecasts not sentiments?
A: The only brief derailers were ah-boy's math weakness and the lockdown pains. In terms of sentiments I worried briefly about PIP

Perhaps the academic pressure can be considered a long-term worry

Let's put on the red and black hats, and throw open this question to get more ideas

I think this is a short-horizon analysis, not so valuable. Beware othRisk -- Most of the major identifiable derailers are probably listed in the blogpost already. 

Some major derailers are hard to foresee. How about
* family harmony disrupted
* something broken at home
* something lost
* conflicts with colleagues
* medical conditions
* injuries
* accidents
