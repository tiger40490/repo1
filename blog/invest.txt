--new: income eq-funds: my take
I feel most of the big fund houses probably avoid the high-yield, high-risk stocks such as U.S. REITs.

I guess for them, 4% div is considered high. I assume the fund dividend payout comes strictly from stock dividend, not position liquidation. Therefore, a typical “high-income” equity fund can only pay 5% average. In reality it could swing between 3% and 7%

--new:covid19 inflation risk
Most of my properties' valuations have a positive correlation with inflation.

Dividend stocks would probably protect me from inflation risk.

--new: cryptocurrency as a combo of gold+mastercard
I feel this currency is like gold, with a limited supply, and chosen as a medium of excahnge

The supply of a given currency is limited, artifically. Increasing demand would bid up the valuation, until another crypotocurrency (a new kid on the block) is born with a 100B initial circulation.

Like gold, mastercard became a medium of exchange. 

Each system enhancement on a given currency could increase its competitive chance of becoming the next mastercard.
