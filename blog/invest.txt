In the U.S. branded college is comparable to medical school or top MBA schools or Joseph Schooling's expensive training. 

U.S. SDXQ homes are comparable to Orchard road mansions.

I feel well-off and Fuller-wealthy precisely because I don't aim at unaffordable luxuries.

-- new: typical return of my various portfolios
t_othRisk

With my China real estate, return is mostly in appreciation. Annual appreciation is fluctuating. Average return is an "unknown positive".

With my SEAsia real estate, return is mostly in renetal. Typically 3-6% net rental yield. Appreciation is hard to estimate with any confidence. I won't estimate.

With my Singapore real estate, return is mostly in rental. Typically 4% net rental yield. Average annual appreciation is a small positive.

With my CPF savings (Singapore's version of 401k), guaranteed non-taxable return is around 4% compound, guaranteed by the full faith of the Singapore government.

With my bond funds, dividend + appreciation return (annualized, net of fees) is typically 1-3%

With my small but growing equity portfolio, usually there's no management fee. Return is a mix of dividend and appreciation. Probably 4-8% pre-tax. I can refine my estimate, but it would take too much analysis. 

With my tiny portfolio of private equities, there's no appreciation. Return is strictly in coupons, but I have hit some capital losses. Overall return is around zero.

It's invalid and misleading to compare with a hot asset portfolio (cryptos or growth stocks), for various reasons.

-- new: 5m cycling from home to rail station
To improve my inflexibility about commute, am willing to accept up to 5m cycling trip from home to the rail station.
This could help my wife's or kids' commutes.

Note my evening commute is much less stressful.

-- fuxi: boost MOETF DYOC
Right now, my diversification effort is not boosting aggregate DYOC

Should I cut some low-yield positions and top up on some high-yield stocks?

-- new: safe div stock: comparable to corp bonds
I now feel 4% DYOC stocks beat 6% high-yield bonds.

Granted the bonds guarantee the payment rate but look at credit quality, reliability and appreciation.

if a bond has 6% coupon rate, then credit risk and dependability is questionable

if a bond is relatively safe with, eg 4% coupon rate, then I would say a 3% DYOC stock would be quite possibly comparable quality.

In all cases, the stock has chance of appreciation/depreciation.

A 4% CDY aristocrat beats most of the bonds out there.

Last time was eq mufu. In hindsight, I didn't learn a lot. Actually, I was not able to. The mufu funds are almost opaque and rigid. I couldn't follow my views on individual companies.

Canadian stocks are not the only ones with withholding tax. Year-end 1099-DIV form has the most reliable data

Luckily, some (or all) the withholding taxes are recoverable if you file a US tax return.

-- update blogpost on inflation
perhaps https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/2020/08/08/inflation-discrediting-high-savings-ratebrbr/ or https://tanbinvest.dreamhosters.com/2021/02/03/dbs-seminar-on-saving4retirement/

Most reputable authors from U.S., China, and other countries present inflation risk as one of the most serious risks for retirees. However, SG trec is much much better. However, my friend Tianjue disagrees...

-- jolt: correlation of psf and d2mrt is not so clear. 
I think the count of interested buyers for each unit is very small, unlike gold.
We rarely have 2 identical units only different in terms of d2mrt, unlike commodities.
