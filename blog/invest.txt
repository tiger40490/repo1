if I meet Shuo in person and reveal my cash flow higher ground (carefree over the foreseeable future)
* SG citizenship esp. medical, CPF, 
* low burn rate in SG
* career longevity on Wall St
.. I think he would feel 'Fuck! This guy is doing better than most of us. Can retire now". I would get negative jealousy. 

Many of my peers are still working hard to climb up, but in reality, how long can they stay at that level? Probably not beyond 60. At a mid-level, they may need to make way in a few years, at age 55 perhaps.

--new cash flow high-ground^low-ground
I like the loose but visual concept of "cashflow higher ground"
Each househould can move between lower ground and higher ground as major events take place. Even a country can go through the same, as SG did during covid19.

On a low ground, household outlays exceed income, debts exceed assets, debt servicing becomes a major expense, or salary income stability is in doubt. Some households sink lower and lower, apparently unable to get out. Jack Zhang lost his job and then hit the pandemic, but thanks to his savings and low burn rate, he probably didn't sink further.

Personal prognosis -- If I were to take on a USD 700k school-district house, I would slide into lower ground, partly due to high interest and property taxes.

In a down turn such as a pandemic, the lower grounds are more at risk of overrun.

On the higher ground, I feel a need to build up my defense, strengthen my foundation, and raise the ground even higher.

What type of insurance is relevant? Not endowment, not life insurance. My focus is Disaster insurance such as major medical and eldershield. These are rare events so hopefully successful claim rate is low and premium is low. Such low-cost insurance plans help strengthen the foundation of my high ground. Recall the tallboy vs K3 story?

On the lower ground, people struggle to cope. On the higher ground, you can enjoy, relax and live in relative peace and comfort.

Invest in property iFF you believe local economy will grow long term.

--div yield on cost = DY over initial cost

--pre-retirement burn rate SGD 2k/person/month is considered decent.

--new: income eq-funds: my take
I feel most of the big fund houses probably avoid the high-yield, high-risk stocks such as U.S. REITs.

I guess for them, 4% div is considered high. I assume the fund dividend payout comes strictly from stock dividend, not position liquidation. Therefore, a typical “high-income” equity fund can only pay 5% average. In reality it could swing between 3% and 7%

What's the lifetime risk that my family may fall on hard times and needs belt-tightening? Not zero. My parents experienced that. Some affulent families can't cope with such a change. My family is not well-to-do and I feel relatively confident we can cope.
* healthcare including bx -- we can rely on policlinics + TCM clinics.
* nutrition -- see blogpost on basic healthy 
* kids' enrichment -- would become a luxury to live without

--fuxi: why I spend so much disposable time on personal finance, mostly ressearch and decision making? More than tech or wellness
Not completely irrational. There are rational reasons, perhaps subconscious.

--new:covid19 inflation risk
Most of my properties' valuations have a positive correlation with inflation. 

Endowment policy holders among my friends would probably suffer from inflation. Likewise, my GRR nonwork income would hurt by inflation, but long-term rental growth may benefit.

Dividend stocks would probably protect me from inflation risk.

Reliable div is more important than index-beating appreciation.

Consistent div usually comes from a defensive stock

--new: cryptocurrency as a combo of gold+mastercard
I feel this currency is like gold, with a limited supply, and chosen as a medium of excahnge

The supply of a given currency is limited, artifically. Increasing demand would bid up the valuation, until another crypotocurrency (a new kid on the block) is born with a 100B initial circulation.

Like gold, mastercard became a medium of exchange. 

Each system enhancement on a given currency could increase its competitive chance of becoming the next mastercard.
