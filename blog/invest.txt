-- update livelihood blogs (S.Liu or Maslow)
[[Nomadland]] and many other movies and songs portray the livelihood pressures (even hardships) of ordinary people in relatively affluent locations by global standard. (For example, most Singaporeans would feel some livelihood pressure.) For them, my ezlife on the cash flow high ground is .. dream. 

I like mathematical criteria for that high ground, such as brbr, Fuller Wealth. By these criteria, my ezlife and my high ground are realistic for some of them, but they lack something to achieve the same.

-- new or update gold^U.S.eq^rEstate: long-term strength
gold offers inflation hedge only over the long term. 

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/08/gold-as-an-inflation-hedge-history-suggests-otherwise.html

"If you look at the very long term, gold should hold its value against inflation. But in any shorter period, it may or may not be a good hedge,"

Am sure there are multiple analyses on the limitation of gold as an inflation hedge.

Even U.S. inflation is not so bad in the short term.

-- new: some retirees do worry about inflation eroding nest egg
https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/heres-an-option-to-protect-your-portfolio-from-inflation.html says Inflation is a top concern as investors fret about the rising cost of groceries, housing, gasoline and other living expenses.

Q: Is this widespread in the U.S. or Singapore?
A: I have limited insight. I would assume this is a top concern among some retirees in every country.

We can look at actual inflation. One of the biggest complaints of Chinese citizens is inflation in everyday purchases (excluding housing). SG is not bad as discussed in several blogposts. 

Q: is SGD 3k CRBR realistic? 
A: I still feel confident. 

-- fuxi: Singapore HDB locations
Yishun central HDB estate has nearly everything, but lower valuation mostly due to the affluent favoring d2city (how about Holland Village?). I guess Tampines, JurongEast are similar.

Bishan has worse d2city than TPY, but has better connectivity, library, jogging track.. In X years, I would not care about some of these factors.

-- MOETF rebalance
Many high-yield bluechips should get higher allocation
concentration risk -- increase allocation on low concentration sectors
* consumer
* telco
* mining, usually international

Increase international stocks without heavy U.S. presence

Some sectors are interest-rate sensitive. Need to avoid topping up, but they have DYOC

--update Tianjue.Lin blogpost
In my younger days, I had to work hard over decades to improve my status for the mating competition.  When I first had kids, I didn't believe the likes of WQ.Luo. I was driven to improve housing, education resources... for my kids, engaging in the arms race with millions of other parents.

Simiarly, the inflation fear was a widespread brainwash.

Medical cost inflation fear was driven by my own parents...

All of these "struggles" are taught to every young men as part of Chinese enculuration.

Therefore, I felt perhaps $3M would be needed. Those around me who gave up on ffree were seen as _quitters_.

-- update "ffree is a state of mind"
What's the real difference between me and my cohort in terms of ffree ?

I record/reconcile my burn rate over decades, and have high confidence in my forecast.
I have a reliable nonwork income in cpfLife and HDB rental, not counting other rental properties.
I say and feel I can stop working any time .. Statement 1
I say both parents can stop working indefinitely (and my family can live a reasonable, comfortable life) .. Statement 2. 
I sometimes say that I have more money than I need for my lifetime .. Statement 3. 
^^^ My circle of a few dozen friends never say these things. Am I serious? Yes. I didn't say what kind of family lifestyle Statement 2/3 entail. 

I often feel free to (and actually did) choose lower jobs. I don't think many in my cohort feel that same level of freedom.

I have no worries about medical, retirement income, long-term inflation. I think many of my cohort are not so care-free. These are big components of long-term ffree.

buy-n-forget SP500_ETF relies on the index admin as stock pickers to adjust the portfolio

buy-n-forget a single stock doesn't involve exit-timing. Can rarely beat SP500_ETF.

Other ETFs, like sector ETF or other countries' ETF are usually less successful than SP500_ETF

--new: index investing relies on the index-admin as stock-picker
I think US index funds show far better returns than other regional indices. When we say mutual funds can't beat the index, we only mean the U.S. broad indices.

The admin of the indices are the real stock pickers and portfolio managers for those passive funds. 

-- new: which middle-class aspiration â‰  LG2
t_cmcUS
So far, all the blogposts on this broad topic (..) have singled out aspirations that are non-consequential:

Branded college
SDXQ
Spacious home
Car ownership
..

Q: Is there one middle-class aspiration that I do subscribe to?
safe, conducive school? This is not just for middle-class
Safe, clean street? No. This is not just for middle-class

-- update blogpost on SG retirement location
I used to focus on d2stadium, d2lib. Now only d2mrt is important. In my older days, even d2mrt would be less important. Remote parts of SG is best.
