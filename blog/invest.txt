-- fuxi or update post on U.S. eq market strength
jolt: China is the growing economic superpower, rivaling U.S., but in terms of stocks potential, it lacks all of the power, trec, market support that's available in U.S. stocks.

SG, Germany, Australia ... also have strong, competitive economies but lack the same strengths of the U.S. stocks.
-- update ...
when I told Sheng.Zeng about SG healthcare/nursing cost in SG^Chn, he pointed out unqualified doctors (庸医), more of a problem in China
-- which China bank position to downsize? BOC ?
Agr is best performer among them

== update lifestyle creep
When a family's disposable income grows, they break traditional guidelines of simple life

eg: "family car" -> 2 cars per family still not enough
eg: "sharing a bedroom between 2 kids" -> one bed room per kid
eg: "Aircon in bedrooms only" -> a/c in living room and kitchen

-- CpfLife ERS amount won't be enough.
-- which level of ffree? well above Level 5 ffree

It's crucial to be clear what exactly we want out of stock trading. Many valid priorities of other investors are not important to us. In fact, these OPPs (other people's priorities) may get in our way. 

* when you add those OPP, your life becomes more complicated, when it can be simpler like mine. You may have to babysit your positions. Your firewall is strained.
* when you add those OPP, your priority list would see some of your true priorities pushed down. Analog: carry-on luggage vs checked luggage.
* when you add those OPP, you may take on more risks.

-- new: 
when stock picking is an active recreation, then novelty becomes a non-trivial factor. That favors international exotic names, and new names. 

However, I have bought a lot of high-yield names. The remaining names tend to be low-yield. Hard to find any suitable stocks.

-- new: high-yield, low growth, blue chips
T:US is probably a leading example.
Singtel is another well-known example.

How about the red chips? 
My view on gov red chips has changed. They seem to pay good dividends to compensate for very poor long-term trend.

U.S. dividend stocks offer better long-term prospect. The red chips don't qualify for my income ptf.

best China index
You can collect the count of tracking ETFs for each index. The most popular index is MSCI China.

Gary singled out FTSE A50.

-- update blogpost on (de)stressor..
buy-n-forget SP500_ETF relies on the index admin as stock pickers to adjust the portfolio. Other ETFs, like sector ETF or other countries' ETF are usually less successful than SP500_ETF

(buy-n-forget a single stock doesn't involve exit-timing. Can rarely beat SP500_ETF.)

-- slow-cooking update livelihood blogs (S.Liu or Maslow)
[[Nomadland]] and many other movies and songs portray the livelihood pressures (even hardships) of ordinary people in relatively affluent locations (affluent as defined by global standard). For example, most Singaporeans would feel some livelihood pressure. 

For these individuals, my ezlife on the cash flow high ground is .. dream. 

I like mathematical criteria for that high ground, such as brbr, Fuller Wealth. By these criteria, my ezlife and my high ground are realistic for some of them, but they lack something to achieve the same.

-- slow-cooking new: which middle-class aspiration ≠ LG2
t_cmcUS
t_sharpQ
So far, all the blogposts on this broad topic (..) have singled out aspirations that are non-consequential:

Branded college
SDXQ
Spacious home
Car ownership
..

Q: Is there one middle-class aspiration that I do subscribe to?
safe, conducive school? This is not just for middle-class
Safe, clean street? No. This is not just for middle-class

-- fuxi: Jun.Z on SG condo
t_misperception
appreciation is slow in most locations. Don't believe agents who boast their appreciation potential.

Foreigner demand is dampened by ABSD, esp. in non-prime locations. These locations are mostly sold to local buyers.

-- fuxi: Jun.Z on cars
German cars are expensive if new, but cheaper than Japanese as a used car. He felt by design Japanese cars can go for many years after first 10Y.

So I had the misperception that German cars are designed better, stronger.

I think this is really a brainwash by my friends. 

I suspect there's a similar brainwash against wood houses.

--fuxi: index investing relies on the index-admin as stock-picker
I think US index funds show far better returns than other regional indices. When we say mutual funds can't beat the index, we only mean the U.S. broad indices.

The admin of the indices are the real stock pickers and portfolio managers for those passive funds. 

-- fuxi: why I feel so effective, rewarding, satisfactory ... about my cash-flow, more so than wellness, work-life-balance, QQx, life-long learning...?

Reason: accumulation is more effective in family finance than the other areas
I have gravitated towards C and SQL precisely due to accumulation.

Reason: less monitoring or refresh needed. I have my exp recon routine + cash pile mgmt strategies. In contrast, wellness, tech learning ... require very high on-going effort.

Reason: my numerical analytical advantage is clearer in per-finance than most areas. QQ and coding drill are also similar.
