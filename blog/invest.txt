pre-clear large qty like $1k/name
If I have many names to trade at the same time, then risk of oversight is higher. Avoid working while trading.
small (even fractional) orders are still safer than big orders.

It's crucial to be clear what exactly we want out of stock trading. Many valid priorities of other investors are not important to us. In fact, these OPPs (other people's priorities) may get in our way. 

* when you add those OPP, your life becomes more complicated, when it can be simpler like mine. You may have to babysit your positions. Your firewall is strained.
* when you add those OPP, your priority list would see some of your true priorities pushed down. Analog: carry-on luggage vs checked luggage.
* when you add those OPP, you may take on more risks.

-- new: gov red chips
My view on gov red chips has changed. They seem to pay good dividends to compensate for very poor long-term trend.

U.S. dividend stocks offer better long-term prospect. The gov red chips don't qualify for my income ptf.

GNI measures income earned by the nationals regardless of location.

Those are the high-level concepts. The actual subtractions/additions are important and are sometimes imprecise.

Earn/Save/Invest: avoid peer comparison. Some people would be good at all 3, but usually there's not much to learn from them.

So the peer comparison would be counterproductive.

-- new: entry/exit: stick to proven rule@@
t_critiq
I often hear authors advocate discipline -- "Set your own rules and follow them consistently." However, why do we need to monitor the market rather than program a computer to do so?

More importantly, how do I know when to (turn on override and) modify my rule?

I think in reality, what we can realistically do is "follow personal rules 95% of the time"

What percentage of retail investors have the descipline to achieve that? One in 10? Among these millions of investors, their numeric rules are all different and therefore create millions of "free agents" that power the free market.

-- new or update: personal system4stock-picking 
if you want to gradually develop a personal stock-picking "system", then you need to make a large number of small but real decision, over different times. A few big trades won't grow your confidence fast enough.

To become an experienced stock investor, you also need to make many informed decisions and learn from that experience.

Q: how much retrospective analysis needed?
A: not about how many hours but how much traction you gain (not wheel-spinning). You should cut down the review when you notice dimishing return.

Quick learning is an advantage of stock vis-a-vis other investments.

-- MOETF rebalance
Many high-yield bluechips should get higher allocation
concentration risk -- increase allocation on low concentration sectors
* consumer
* telco
* mining, usually international

Increase international stocks without heavy U.S. presence

Some sectors are interest-rate sensitive. Need to avoid topping up, but they have DYOC

buy-n-forget SP500_ETF relies on the index admin as stock pickers to adjust the portfolio

buy-n-forget a single stock doesn't involve exit-timing. Can rarely beat SP500_ETF.

Other ETFs, like sector ETF or other countries' ETF are usually less successful than SP500_ETF

-- new: few]%%cohort have a global branded degree
In their 20's, China was poorer than now, very few could get a scholarship to a branded college overseas, so they have to settle for a lower-tier.

After a certain age like 30, a low single-digit percentage would see enough justification for the high cost of a branded degree. 
Most of the Chinese peers already had a postgrad degree in their 20's. Hard to justify another postgrad degree. 

If they were unable to earn a branded degree, then I think that's one reason why so many of them have unrealistic evaluations of a branded degree.

-- update "branded car"
as I age, I see more and more similarities between branded college and branded clothing. The consumer here is the parent. Parents spend very large amount of disposable income on these status items.

inflation (beyond CPI) is largely driven by exclub.
fancy food, branded clothing, residential property, luxury car, branded college ... 

As exclub demand increases, vendors increase prices. I think governments can't do much about this demand, except property cooling measures.

Even U.S. inflation is not so bad in the short term.

-- new: some retirees do worry about inflation eroding nest egg
https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/heres-an-option-to-protect-your-portfolio-from-inflation.html says Inflation is a top concern as investors fret about the rising cost of groceries, housing, gasoline and other living expenses.

Q: Is this widespread in the U.S. or Singapore?
A: I have limited insight. I would assume this is a top concern among some retirees in every country.

We can look at actual inflation. One of the biggest complaints of Chinese citizens is inflation in everyday purchases (excluding housing). SG is not bad as discussed in several blogposts. 

Q: is SGD 3k CRBR realistic? 
A: I still feel confident. 

-- slow-cooking update livelihood blogs (S.Liu or Maslow)
[[Nomadland]] and many other movies and songs portray the livelihood pressures (even hardships) of ordinary people in relatively affluent locations (affluent as defined by global standard). For example, most Singaporeans would feel some livelihood pressure. 

For these individuals, my ezlife on the cash flow high ground is .. dream. 

I like mathematical criteria for that high ground, such as brbr, Fuller Wealth. By these criteria, my ezlife and my high ground are realistic for some of them, but they lack something to achieve the same.

So far, all the blogposts on this broad topic (..) have singled out aspirations that are non-consequential:

Branded college

Q: Is there one middle-class aspiration that I do subscribe to?
safe, conducive school? This is not just for middle-class
Safe, clean street? No. This is not just for middle-class

appreciation is slow in most locations. Don't believe agents who boast their appreciation potential.

Foreigner demand is dampened by ABSD, esp. in non-prime locations. These locations are mostly sold to local buyers.

-- fuxi: Jun.Z on cars
German cars are expensive if new, but cheaper than Japanese as a used car. He felt by design Japanese cars can go for many years after first 10Y.

So I had the misperception that German cars are designed better, stronger.

I think this is really a brainwash by my friends. 

I suspect there's a similar brainwash against wood houses.

--fuxi: index investing relies on the index-admin as stock-picker
I think US index funds show far better returns than other regional indices. When we say mutual funds can't beat the index, we only mean the U.S. broad indices.

The admin of the indices are the real stock pickers and portfolio managers for those passive funds. 

-- fuxi: why I feel so effective, rewarding, satisfactory ... about my cash-flow, more so than wellness, work-life-balance, QQx, life-long learning...?

Reason: accumulation is more effective in family finance than the other areas
I have gravitated towards C and SQL precisely due to accumulation.

Reason: less monitoring or refresh needed. I have my exp recon routine + cash pile mgmt strategies. In contrast, wellness, tech learning ... require very high on-going effort.

Reason: my numerical analytical advantage is clearer in per-finance than most areas. QQ and coding drill are also similar.
