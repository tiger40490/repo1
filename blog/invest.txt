-- new (gz or invest?): regaining the lead
(tag: t_brank11)
Imagine the scene if I reunion with my OC boss or one of those ambitious ex-classmates of Shiyan, and over a coffee reveal a bit of my cash flow higher ground --
* carefree through retirement age and through my twilight years
* SG citizenship esp. medical, CPFLife, housing,  
* low burn rate in SG/MYS, lower than U.S.
* career longevity on Wall St

The mroe he knows, the more likely he would feel 'Fuck! This guy is getting ahead of most of us. Can retire now". I would get negative jealousy. He might even avoid me or wish me bad luck.

Many of my same-age "peers" are still working hard to climb up, but in reality, how long can they stay at that level? Probably not beyond 60. At a mid-level, they may need to make way in a few years, at age 55 perhaps.

In contrast, I'm in a kind of "easy" maintenance mode -- "going all the way to the end", as described in another blogpost

A major part (but not the only major part) of the situation is the relative importance of cash flow freedom, brank peer comparison/FOLB, immigration choices etc. I was left behind on the slow track for many years, left behind by those manager types, but on other fronts I have progressively moved ahead of them. 

Now I have accepted that I'm not a manager type. I now see many limitations of the manager career path. I don't envy them as much as before.

--new: income eq-funds: my take
I feel most of the big fund houses probably avoid the high-yield, high-risk stocks such as U.S. REITs.

I guess for them, 4% div is considered high. I assume the fund dividend payout comes strictly from stock dividend, not position liquidation. Therefore, a typical “high-income” equity fund can only pay 5% average. In reality it could swing between 3% and 7%

--update blogpost on theoretical-min retirement burn rate
What's the lifetime risk that my family may fall on hard times and needs belt-tightening? Not zero. My parents experienced that. Some affulent families can't cope with such a change. My family is not well-to-do and I feel relatively confident we can cope.
* healthcare including bx -- we can rely on policlinics + TCM clinics.
* nutrition -- see blogpost on basic healthy 
* kids' enrichment -- would become a luxury to live without

--fuxi: why I spend so much disposable time on personal finance, mostly ressearch and decision making? More than tech or wellness
Not completely irrational. There are rational reasons, perhaps subconscious.

--new:covid19 inflation risk
Most of my properties' valuations have a positive correlation with inflation. 

Endowment policy holders among my friends would probably suffer from inflation. Likewise, my GRR nonwork income would hurt by inflation, but long-term rental growth may benefit.

Dividend stocks would probably protect me from inflation risk.

Reliable div is more important than index-beating appreciation.

Consistent div usually comes from a defensive stock

--new: cryptocurrency as a combo of gold+mastercard
I feel this currency is like gold, with a limited supply, and chosen as a medium of excahnge

The supply of a given currency is limited, artifically. Increasing demand would bid up the valuation, until another crypotocurrency (a new kid on the block) is born with a 100B initial circulation.

Like gold, mastercard became a medium of exchange. 

Each system enhancement on a given currency could increase its competitive chance of becoming the next mastercard.
