-- next HDB home: 
buy first (am picky on the buy)
This will save us the trouble of moving twice.

Possibility of renting out some extra rooms.

-- consider top-up to cpf OA
If I need it for housing I can take it out, right?

Go to CPF service center to confirm.

On the same trip, transfer some 1k from OA to SA just to live through it.
Ask CPF to compute the additional interest earned each year

--consider the FWD heart+cancer insurance
tbudget -- 2-4H

--update blogpost on 3likely derailers of current carefree easy life
My current carefree phase has lasted more than a year since late 2018. 

Q: what are the derailers observed so far, based on facts, not forecasts not sentiments?
A: The only brief derailers were ah-boy's math weakness and the lockdown pains. In terms of sentiments I worried briefly about PIP

Perhaps the academic pressure can be considered a long-term worry

Let's put on the red and black hats, and throw open this question to get more ideas

I think this is a short-horizon analysis, not so valuable. Beware othRisk -- Most of the major identifiable derailers are probably listed in the blogpost already. 

Some major derailers are hard to foresee. How about
* family harmony disrupted
* something broken at home
* something lost
* conflicts with colleagues
* medical conditions
* injuries
* accidents
