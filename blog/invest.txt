-- update blogpost on stock picking distractions
I once spent tons of hours on FSM cherry-picking but underwhelming ROTI

Stock picking analysis? XR did that for a long time but not so spectacular

Just reading the newspapers alone would take lots of mental energy

-- update blogpost on... in a decline, favor companies with 
* div
* massive balance sheet
* stable biz model

-- I feel value investing requires absorbency and is not for everyone. 
Picking undervalued stocks using so much data is a tedious job, and you may be in a way competing with some "strong" players who analyze the same data.

-- I feel undervalued stocks are more visible than overseas properties.
I think properties in "famililar" cities still get less mindshare than undervalued stocks. 

Therefore, I feel the likelihood of finding an undervalued stock is lower.

-- Beyond the 20 most visible stocks in each country or "market", most stocks don't receive a lot of attention. So there might be good value stocks undervalued.

However, I think some "sophisticated" investors use algorithms to analyze published financial statements

Economic moat is popularized by Buffett and is an element of (value) stock picking

-- updated blogpost on SG inflation
3% SG official inflation rate?
My own burn rate record-keeping is the most reliable data source
If we exclude flights, kids, bx, rental cost, then the "couple core burn rate" is not showing any inflation

In fact, I sense a deflation due to price reduction in food and clothing

long-term (30Y) prediction of inflation is unreliable. 3k burn rate growing by 100% over 20Y or 30Y is unreliable.

--update blogpost on Macq economist
 buy property only if you are convinced the local economy would grow over the long term.
In such a context, property is a good inflation protection.

-- update blogpost on compound return 
I think this is exaggerated. 
How many percent of the average investor can achieve, say, 10% compound return over 10Y? I would say one in 10,000.

Risk-free compound return rate is 2%, so 10% is not easy and not common.

More realistic is 4% compound return.

-- new: ffree: j4 peer-comparison analysis
aboutOth

Q: Why writing so many blogposts comparing my ffree with peers?

Because since my teenage years I have observed the vast majority of adults (99% of the people around me), and witnessed their struggle and stress, and later experienced the same myself. 
Since 2017 I started seeing some reasons to feel free -- surreal. It demands a clarification. 

There are a few /identifiable/ differences (btw me and peers) not only in attitude but in the actual cashflow situation 

Another j4 this comparative analysis -- FOMO esp. due to brank (a lost game)

A secondary j4 -- rationalize my U.S. housing decision. The mainstream choice is a $800k school district home.

--fuxi: The most wasteful small purchases:
* basketball -- bought four so far. But there are many less visible wastes.
* board games, legos
* toys
* boy's stationeries
* kitchen utensils

Given these decisions are made consciously each time, they are much better than the invisible wastes.

Given the small sums, these wastes don't really threaten my bare-bones ffree, but they are fundamentally related to my views on deprivation, lavish etc

More damaging is buying harmful foods. We not only waste money, but also harm our health.

.. now some of the best small spends below ..
group workout
cheap exercise equipment
fancy fruits
salads
fancy dressing for raw reg
smoothie + chia
congee + chia

* If recreational amount, then too much tcost.
* If 20k, then I need to convince myself to take the plunge. I would say that long term prospect is good.
AT&T is good
