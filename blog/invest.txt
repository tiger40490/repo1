--fuxi: Q: what's the best use of additional 100k?
I will consider
* lower-paying job with more satisfaction
* more frq visits with grandparents
* vacations at nearby locations. There are plenty of world class yet low-cost destinations. No Japan no Korea please -- luxury and unnecessary. Our family life isn't less complete without them.

Many fellow parents (plan to) spend disproportionately on their kids because .. they want-to not pressured-to. Chinese parents feel good about martyrdom -- saving up and investing on kids education. 

Labor of love... However, Some (33 to 50%) of my peers appear to be under pressure to put up such huge amounts, due to peer pressure and societal expectation like a "norm".

How am I different?
I don't plan to spend on branded college, so there's a 50/50 chance I won't start saving until 4Y before college
I don't want to spend on luxury vacations as an "education" -- unnecessary and too costly
I do consider taking lower jobs to spend more time with kids.
I plan to spend on kids' non-academic pursuits, as Jenny on swimming, piano, coding, camps

Q: prediction: my visible burn rate with mindchamps without tax without air-tickets? 5k, excluding anything from wife's account
saving rate target with allowance payout: 5k. Be kind to yourself. 

Both targets are useful and valuable. but we need different attitudes towards each.

I'm generally competent at saving but stress can still happen
