--new: envious of U.S. superior income
I tend to look up towards U.S. and HK as high-income countries. Here's my critical assessment
* for tech professionals: Yes U.S. (not HK) is much higher than SG, but BR is also higher, so brbr is unclear.
* for WallSt techies: Yes U.S. and HK are higher-income than SG and many more jobs, but BR is higher. Brbr is probably inferior to SG.
* for main street: U.S. (not HK) is higher-income than SG, but BR is higher. Brbr is unclear.

However, there are many other factors such as social safety net, job opportunities, edu options, 

--update blogpost on "half the stressor"
cashflow stress is the biggest livelihood stress for most people. FIRE discussions reinforce this common notion. I think it is only slightly exaggerated, like by 0.1%

family harmony, wellness ... can become more serious stressors.

FOMO/kiasu/exclub/inferiority and waste-of-talent are common stressors but void

I feel the long-term burn rate is SGD 5k including bx premiums, taxes, airtickets

-- fuxi: %%avg return rate
properties outperformed. Even without appreciation, the rental savings alone translates to at least 4% net return
my unit trusts -- probably 2-4%
Private equity -- I managed to recover from a big loss (Airtropolic), so barely positive return overall

A rigorous calc would include unrealized pnl from mark-to-market, ...

I have a blogpost on the highest returns achieved. I think it's in compound

--fuxi: FCF and big investments
Some higih-earning individuals are unable to buy a home. I think my ex-colleagues Damien, Pinsky might be among them. I imagine they don't give it priority. 

They could pay a high rent (up to 40% of their income), take a car loan to drive an expensive car, ... basically spend 99% of their salary every year. It's never hard to find ways to spend money.

The high rent, of course, goes down the drain. 

Big investments don't necessarily require high brbr, but require savings i.e. FCF.

Probably no impact on my investment decisions.

--new: too much cash saved for legacy
othRisk
My "challenge" in this blogpost is not having too little left for my kids, but having too much cash now, 50Y before my expected end of life. This is a minor challenge compared to all my other challenges.

Default plan is not donation but legacy to my 2 children and grandchildren (if I'm lucky). If something happens to them and my wife goes before me, then donation is an acceptable default.

Most important-yet-neglected factors within my control -- 1) longevity and career longevity 2) what my kids become. These controllable factors ought to be my focus.

Next, keep an eye on the long-horizon risks, beyond inflation. See my blogpost on "financial protections: powerless against some rare disasters"

Next question: what asset classes are suitable for holding long-term beyond 50Y.

If I have more confidence about holding long-term, then I can afford to take more risks. However, I hate long troughs (see the other blogpost)

stocks, 
properties

-- fuxi or update blogpost on brbr?
Compared to 2016, my burn rate is down by 2-3k, partly due to pre-school, airfare, ...

Now i feel $1k to $2k reduction in burn rate means a lot to my (brbr and) sense of confidence, peaceful leisure, wealth. I think this reveals a fundamental difference between me and my peers.

Exclub wealth? Not enhanced by brbr improvement.
