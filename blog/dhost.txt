--fuxi: keep the victan6.dreamhost.com as it shows a default wpress install
--new: to install wp on an existing "website", 
panel->domains->oneClickInstalls or
panel->wpress->learnMore&install
-- fuxi: my dreamhosters.com subdomains are treated (by the panel) as my domains
--fuxi: 
panel->support->dataCenters has a technical and definitive listing of all my web sites (identified by FQDN), all my databases, all my ssh user accounts.

--fuxi: 2 days after sign-up, I can feel the 97D deadline! 30D would be much worse
--greplace hyperlinks after migration?
Can we do go live with the dhost wpress first?
