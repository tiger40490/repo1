-- new: criteria@chen2mi2
I tend to use (daily) gaming hours; wife tend to use total screen time.
The 2 criteria may or may not cause confusion, but it's better to clarify and be explicit.

My criteria is sometimes unfair as many "more academic" kids have longer gaming hours.
Wife's criteria is sometimes unfair as many people young and old have longer hours but in socially acceptable ways.

I told counseller CM.C that without restraint, boy may hit 10H/day screen time. (can ask boy to predict.) 
CM.C pointed out the pent-up demand -- Boy would spend excessive hours for a few initial days.

So our criteria are all questionable, imprecise and incomplete.

counsellor gave a few additional criteria
* escape from reality such as difficult subjects, exam fear/setbacks, demanding parents, bullying, broken family, 
* shut off from friends and family. cold shoulders to parents. 
* detriment to physical wellbeing
** sleep deprivation
** diet out of controll
* withdrawal symptom .. unable to cope without those "things". But what "things"? Relying on screens for .. blogging is not considered chen2mi2 !

She said we are not close to that stage yet. We can monitor and be proactive. Would it be too late? She didn't say yes or no. I feel no.

wife experiences a subconscious fear so she overacts to boy watching gamer-talks.

-- new: how much total screen time is excessive?
I have 10H+/day and I feel dependent on blogg ... but not considered exessive !

double-standdard?

e-book is the default among the cohort below 40, so any screen time on e-books could be classified as productive screen time like learning.

How do we know the composition of his screen time?
We need to demonstrate trust on boy's integrity. 
This trust is something rare and invaluable. 
I remember my parents trust on me when handing over large sums of money.

Wife and I have complaints about eye sight, physical workout, motivation for studies, but look, majority of 13-year-olds have similar issues and their parents are not deseparate or fearful. 

-- counseller CM.C pointed out that we (boy and family) are lucky that whenever one parent is upset, the other parent is available, and the kid can go to the other parent.
I told her that I cherish the open door (open communication), because in many families, there's a shut door between father and son.

-- new: reasonable screen time
Based on my observation, I doubt there's reasonable screen time with my son. 

I once said "half an hour screen time beside gaming time as controlled by mom", but he is so far unable to ..

I don't care about other people's definitin of addiction ...
I feel if he spends more than 90m/day looking at the phone screen, it's addiction.

--new:
ask boy (and wife) what things dad can do with boy each week, partly to replace the screen time.
It could be a memorable routine.

I may have a bigger role to play in reducing his screen addiction

--new: owning phone 
Q1: what evidence would convince me that my son is ready to carry a phone
A: If I see that he doesn't care when it's given to him.

Q1b: but is it realistic and reasonable demand of a parent?

choice: remove battery, but boy would not have a chance to show improvement
choice: some still-tougher policy, but boy would demand reasons

-- new: smartphone can be acceptable for boy #OPL
Pearleen Ong on 19 Oct suggested that smartphone is widely considered a semi-necessity, so it's probably not necessary to delay the handover

I said some S1 students do not have a smartphone. She said these students may feel left out, perhaps due to poverty.

.. at some age, boy may save up and buy a smartphone himself. This is more likely to happen if there's insufficient agreement among the 3 of us.
The open communications channel is priceless. I feel it's built on trust.
