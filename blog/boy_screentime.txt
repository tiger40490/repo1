-- let's email to XMS to ask how to lock out boy.

-- fuxi: need to repeat to boy:
Some people play games 3 hours a day but somehow score higher in exams.
Some people smoke, drink alcohol, take drugs, but live longer than us who don't. Reality remains -- those things are harmful to their health.

-- new: criteria@chen2mi2
I tend to use (daily) gaming hours; wife tend to use total screen time.
The 2 criteria may or may not cause confusion, but it's better to clarify and be explicit.

My criteria is sometimes unfair as many "more academic" kids have longer gaming hours.
Wife's criteria is sometimes unfair as many people young and old have longer hours but in socially acceptable ways.

I told counseller CM.C that without restraint, boy may hit 10H/day screen time. (can ask boy to predict.) 
CM.C pointed out the pent-up demand -- Boy would spend excessive hours for a few initial days.

So our criteria are all questionable, imprecise and incomplete.

counsellor CM.C gave a few additional criteria
* escape from reality such as difficult subjects, exam fear/setbacks, demanding parents, bullying, broken family, 
* shut off from friends and family. cold shoulders to parents. 
* detriment to physical wellbeing
** sleep deprivation
** diet out of controll
* withdrawal symptom .. unable to cope without those "things". But what "things"? Relying on screens for .. blogging is not considered chen2mi2 !

She said we are not close to that stage yet. We can monitor and be proactive. Would it be too late? She didn't say yes or no. I feel no.

-- new: reasonable/excessive screen time@@
Based on my observation, I doubt there's reasonable screen time with my son. 

I have 10H+/day and I feel dependent on blogg ... but not considered exessive !

double-standdard?

e-book is the default among the cohort below 40, so any screen time on e-books could be classified as productive screen time like learning.

How do we know the composition of his screen time?
We need to demonstrate trust on boy's integrity. 
This trust is something rare and invaluable. 
I remember my parents trust on me when handing over large sums of money.

Wife and I have complaints about eye sight, physical workout, motivation for studies, but look, majority of 13-year-olds have similar issues and their parents are not deseparate or fearful. 

-- counseller CM.C pointed out that we (boy and family) are lucky that whenever one parent is upset, the other parent is available, and the kid can go to the other parent.
I told her that I cherish the open door (open communication), because in many families, there's a shut door between father and son.

--fuxi: counsellor chat on meimei phone addiction
family outing to reduce screen addiction. Cycling with dad is similar. watching a movie at home together could be counted as family time, and perhaps much better than "phone screen time".

My discipline on meimei is looser than ah-boy, but it could be a good thing, as my strict confrontational stance /breeds/ anger. Anger breeds loss of control.

I tend to feel that the common advice and strategies won't help, but look at this case.

-- fuxi: smartphone can be acceptable for boy #OPL
Pearleen Ong on 19 Oct suggested that smartphone is widely considered a semi-necessity, so it's probably not necessary to delay the handover

I said some S1 students do not have a smartphone. She said these students may feel left out, perhaps due to poverty.

.. at some age, boy may save up and buy a smartphone himself. This is more likely to happen if there's insufficient agreement among the 3 of us.
The open communications channel is priceless. I feel it's built on trust.
