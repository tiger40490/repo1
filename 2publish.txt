--instance field as char-array without terminating null
This is recommended if those char-arrays are short and this class gets instantantiated frequently.

Drawback -- when you print this field, the printing function would keep printing beyond the field boundary looking for the terminating null. I saw this in my nyse-intg parser

So as a personal best practice I often saves the terminating null in my char-array field

--empty parens
cout<<fun3() // is perfectly fine
cout<<MyClass2() // probably bad form

Calling a ctor with an empty parens is ... not common. If you want to invoke the no-arg ctor, better drop the redundant parens.

by the way, it's almost always more flexible to implement a no-arg ctor using default-args
