--new blog: more time+facilities4reflective blogging 
.. is a major benefit I'm willing to pay for.

It's a form of "wellbeing" for me, similar to having grandpa (or a friend) to listen to me

--add to blog on staying rented
boy is influenced by classmates, so he needs a better school.
better stay rented so we can move easily

--portable digital piano
Casio PX160. Given 88 keys, this is the lightest model I know. Can remove the stand and further reduce the weight.

My pet peeve for digital pianos is the finger touch. Looks like all the models (I only tried those below $2k) are equally bad, but better than those toy models.

--add to blog on light reading
free newspapers have never proven to be worth carrying. I always find something more interesting or worthwhile to read

--why is my uptown NGRY only 5%
This NGRY is much lower than other cities.

luxury studio and not a shop. 

Vietnam residential is similar, but rental demand is very low.

--better find out calorie content of wines for my next flights

--new blog:
$5 cholesterol screening coupon usable at any CHAS GP. Call HPB 1800 223 1313

--add to blog on pineapple tarts
It's all about temptation. If I don't have it at home then no sufferig no agony.

first battle is how to avoid the temptation.

Now I am facing the temptation, next battle is portion control

--new blog: bridge floss
sensitivity in lower left middle tooth -- the gap between 2 bonding points is too small to reach
--new blog: ## linux concurrency support features
This topic is deep and time consuming so I will only learn some jargons for show-off

I have the OReilly book + Josh's book

spinlock -- addressed in both books
read-write spinlock
binary and counting semaphores
read-write semaphores

--instance field as char-array without terminating null
This is recommended if those char-arrays are short and this class gets instantantiated frequently.

Drawback -- when you print this field, the printing function would keep printing beyond the field boundary looking for the terminating null. I saw this in my nyse-intg parser

So as a personal best practice I often saves the terminating null in my char-array field

--empty parens
cout<<fun3() // is perfectly fine
cout<<MyClass2() // probably bad form

Calling a ctor with an empty parens is ... not common. If you want to invoke the no-arg ctor, better drop the redundant parens.

by the way, it's almost always more flexible to implement a no-arg ctor using default-args
