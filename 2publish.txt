The good thing about today's incident is -- you as a landlord finally got a first-hand observation of a typical situation.

* I can make mistakes including late night noise or wetting the shared carpets, though the severities are different -- The noise affects neighbor's sleep.

* Nick also makes mistakes including (I don't like to give a full list..)
** twice pushing my room door open without knocking, when he felt he had right to be rude to me.
** dumping not-really-smelly trash bin in front of my door
** switching off bathroom light after seeing I was inside.
** forcing the bathroom door to open even though I was holding it from inside
** aggressive, bullying language for minor things like not closing the microwave door
** frequently losing his cool (just about every time he has a grievance)
** not cleaning the bathroom in his month

* I never got angry with him; he always became hostile to me, regardless big or small grievances

* I always apologized immediately. He apologized twice for losing his cool x days ago.

As communicated in my last friendly chat with Nick before new year, it's never perfect collocating with a stranger. We want to be neighborly and tolerant. There will surely be problems like my mistakes. We as adults need some self-constraint and cool to manage those problems.  Today I was not there but you saw first hand how he managed a relatively minor problem (minor in comparison with my earlier mistake.)
