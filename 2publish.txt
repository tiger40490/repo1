--new blog Empty base-class optimiztion
This optmization only zeros out the runtime [1] size of baseclass subobject [2]. All other sizes of empty types are one.
   
Suppose Der subclasses B1 and B2.
If B1 (or B2) is empty, then sizeof(B1) == 1 not zero, but at run time, the Der object size shows the B1 object has zero size, due to EBCO.

If all of Der, B1 and B2 are empty, we know sizeof(Der) == 1, but how about rutime sizeof(an_Der_instance)? Also one, not zero, because this object is a baseclass subject.

--new blog q[Node*] param can be..
A Node address can be an entire aray of Node objects
If the Node class has a nextNode field, then this param can represent a linked list, or head (or any node) of a linked list
If Node class has left and right child nodes, then this param can represent a tree, or root (or any other) node of a tree

Q: Can this param represent an array of linked lists? 
A: No. Since each payload (aka element) in the array is a Node*, then the array looks like a Node**

--update blog on binary semaphore #CSY (halo88)
[[DougLea]] P220 confirms that in some cases release() can increase the binary semaphore to beyond 2, destroying the mutual exclusion control.

However, java binary semaphore is a mutex because releasing a semaphore before aquiring has no effect

--update blog all-static java class
In [[DougLea]] P86, this foremost OO expert briefly noted that it can be best practice to replace a java singleton with an all-static class

--new blog lazy singleton bsed on JVM dynamic classloading (halo88)
In [[DougLea]] P86, this JVM expert pointed out that a simple "eager" singleton is eager in other language, but lazy in Java due to runtime on-demand class loading.

Specifically we mean a public[1] static final field. This initialization is thread-safe by default. Assuming the field is immediately accessed after class loading, this simple design is comparable to the familiar synchronized lazy singleton. What are the pros and cons? 

Synchronized singleton requires more legwork but 
* It lets you pass ctor parameters at runtime. Note the singleton ctor is private but getInstance(userInput) is possible.
* As hinted earlier, you may load the class but do not immediately use the instance, so the simple design incurs the expensive initialization cost too early.

[[DougLea]] ws writen before java5. With java5, [[EffJava]] advocates enum.

[1] DougLea actually prefers private with public getter, for encapsulation.

--new blog starting thread in ctor (halo88)
Q: is it good practice to call new Thread(..).start() in MyClass ctor?

I feel 30% confidence this blog has another post on this subject, to be combined.

P [[DougLea]] points out the potential danger of starting thread in a ctor, esp. if subclasses are beyond your control.

The visibility effect is equivalent to parent thread releasing an implicit lock and acquisition by the run() on new thread.

Frequently, the constructed MyClass instance is used by the new thread, but is MyClass fully constructed? It is if the new Thread(..).start() is last line in ctor, but what if this ctor runs as part of a subclass ctor?

Many of my peers acknowledge the importance of job interivews, but they are able to move up so they don't need to interview again and again.

Their model is risky when they need to move out.

--new blog: criticalMass against churn 
See also post on impact of c++jobs

[tags t_gz_j^cpp, t_domainBet]

Critical mass (eg: in core java self-study) is one of the most effective strategies against technology churn. Once I accumulated the critical mass, I don't need a full time job to sustain it.

Q: how strongly is it related to accumulation?
A: not much AFTER you accumulate the critical mass. With java I did it through enough interviews and reading. 

Q: why some domains offer no critical mass?
A: some (jxee) have limited depth
A: some (TMP, py) have No pattern identified from interview questions

Q: how strongly is it related to leverage?
A: not much though Critical mass enhances leverage

..other examples of criticl mass against churn:
SQL? yes though SQL is diminishing
classic data structures? Yes
c++? yes took much longer to reach criticl mass
STL? yes
socket? not yet
