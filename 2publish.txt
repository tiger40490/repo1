Jarkata was never mentioned as a property investment destination, but Katherine Teopilus (probably local) actually knows the CBD area is not bad. I guess it's more developed than Manila. When I mentioned the traffic jam, she pointed out it creates demand for residential units in CBD, exactly like BGC

Katherine echoes Susan's view that Bankok airbnb model can be fairly profitable but I doubt I have the appetite to run it as a business.

-- add to existing blog: My current preferences are
* shops 
* prime location -> current income + appreciation
** BGC, Peak
* small quantum, not necessarily low psf. This enables me to diversify and try out different products
* less legwork, since I will be in U.S.
* rental demand from outside professsionals? I feel only a few metropolitan cities have those professionals.

-- add to existing blog:
BGC investment now looks inferior due to
- current income in terms of NRY
- ccy 
- active mgmt required
- quantum

-- advertized GRY is always questionable. Haircut can be half or deeper. My 5.5% NRY is probably equivalent to 12% GRY

-- avp role in oc can pay sgd 160k total. Not sure this is typical or on the higher side. 

VP roles can earn base of sgd 200k (tech not mgmt role) but I would say very rare. However, it also shows SG banks are forced or enticed to pay such prices for tech talent

-- first weekday : need to sleep at least 4H in afternoon till 6.30pm when kids come home and starts shouting
Until I finish my 7 dys, let's keep to NY sleeping pattern with plenty of quiet time at night. No need to send boy to school.
