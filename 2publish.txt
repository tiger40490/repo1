Hi Wai,

Nick left a bottle of milk in the fridge door bottom shelf ... already expired. Can you let him know? I don't want to tell him directly. I don't get any chance to talk to him at all. If I mention it would be another negative communication between us. There has been no positive or even social chat between us, even though I said "Merry Christmas". He always ignores me.

There's so far no complaint about the fridge, but since it's shared, I invite you to take a look in case there's any conflict in the future.

Last night around 11.15 Nick opened his lips for the first time. I was cooking, with some noise, not as much as last time. No radio. He said "It's almost midnight please don't make the banging sound.... I'm telling you." I promised no more banging sound. I still don't know what banging sound there was but it was my kitchen noise.

More important than his words is his body language. Cllearly unhappy about the noise, but he wasn't as aggressive, domineering, bursting with anger as last time. He still refused to engage with me in any real dialog -- he wannted to send a message and shut his door, not interested in what I have to tell him. 

Improvement this time -- he gave me a warning in advance , before it's too late and too much to bear, so I could further lower the noise and have a chance to avert another open conflict.
