There's a bit of positive feedback on my c++ coding 
* in Jun or Jul, I conceived a redesign of some c++ component and convinced Josh. He accepted my design.
* in Dec he gave me some code investigation project and I produced a document + a demo spreadsheet to replicate the c++ code. He liked them.

coding drill -- highest satisfaction, self-esteem, sense of achievement. Regadless how manyy books I carry-on, spending more my time coding is still better. The laser focus on coding is precious. I get about 10 hours in month. Those books retain their freshness for a long time. I carry them only as fallback option. Note my coding absorbency is enhanced, I would also feel higher aborbency for tech books, but in such a situation Alwas favor coding as it requires much higher absorbency.

c++QQ/zbs expertise: I got some
 
As stated repeatedly, c++ is the most complicated and biggest language used i industry, at least in terms of syntax. Well, I have impressed many expert interviewers on my c++ language insight.

That means I must have some expertise in c++ QQ topics. For my c++ zbs growth, see separate blogs.

Note socket, shared mem ... are outside c++ language. More like OS library

Deepak, Shanyou, Dilip .. are not stronger. I know more about some c++ subdomains, in both QQ and zbs.

--j4 keeping a big mtg for 30Y? Many people say you borrow cheap, but for what? Do they have a way to generate more return than the loan xq rate (5% or 2.5%)?

If (like me) they have too much cash sitting idle in the bank, why should they borrow 600k at 4% and pay monthly interest of 2k?  I guess they want to keep the cash as contingency?
