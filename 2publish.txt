--new blog: Most c++guys don't understand STL
when I recall the STL interviews, it's clear that majority of c++ app developers use STL every year for 5-10 years almost like a black box. Only 1% has the level of insight as Henry Wu. 

Analogy -- Most of us live in a house without civil engineering insight.

Many interviewe questions drill in on one or two everyday STL functionality (everyone would have used), just below the surface. These questions filter out majority of candidates. 

Intellectual curiosity vs intellectual laziness.  不求甚解，不加咀嚼，囫囵吞枣 -- I see it in many self-taught developers. That's exactly what these interiew questions are designed to identify and sceen out.
