--new blog: ground floor to run daycare
rent a 3-4k home with big ground floor to run a small Chinese language daycare.

My family can use 2nd floor. 3rd floor can sublease out. Part of ground floor can be my storage.

Safe location, not necessarily Chinese concentration. Jersey City and Hoboken are very safe.

May need an asistant in case wife is sick.

--new blog: [19]living%%dream life, now
These are elements of the dream life I envisioned 5..10..20 years ago:

beautiful wife. Stable family
fin: concrete, spacious, well-located home, paid off
fin: no debt burden
fin: reliable passive incomes on appreciating assets
attractive, convincing trec
robust career prospect in a lucritive field, arguably higher security than the FTE
affordable yoga + exercise classes
health -- bmi, sleep, appetite, dental ..
(promotion isn't part of my dream life.)

--new blog: 66kg is too near the upper limit

even 57kg is safe for me

I believe 69 kg would be the upper limit of my green zone, so mid-range is 63kg, not 66kg !

--add to blog on whey
if no temptation, i think one "MRP meal" can last 4 hours. With teptation, it is 20 minutes!

I took 2 level scoops after 8pm 1 Feb. I felt slightly hungry within an hour but didn't eat anything substantial until 10.30pm when wife offered me the left-over noodles

I feel the meal-replacement feature simply doesn't work for me. I get hungry faster than other ppl

consider mixing one scoop MRP + one scoop of whey + teaspoon of chia
:) cheaper than MRP alone
:) precise calorie budgeting and tracking
:) more filling
:( 2 open bottles
