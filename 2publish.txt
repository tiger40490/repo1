--new blog: div stock beats income funds
I have never [1] earned dividend yield above 10% so I am keen to experience it.

[1] The Allinz funds are so fake!

Hopefully, one of my stocks pays a quarterly dividend above 3% of my principal and I will see how thing unfold.

If without eroding NAV I can generate 5% dividend on 6k then this is a strategic asset class for me, better than most FSM funds. A mutual fund eats away 1.5% of the dividend yield
