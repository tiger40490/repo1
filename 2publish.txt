--new blog: CNY trip diet review
In terms of weight (and probably calorie) ... not so effective. I would guess my weight (in Retro) would be 64kg so I plan to bring it down gradually back to 63 and 62.5 kg
In terms of nutrition ... high quliaty
In terms of self-control and daily battles? won some lost some
:) rice at home
:) stayed away from peanuts + love letters + cakeHistory 
:( cakes -- offce free food

biggest enemy remains temptations (+ the ensuing loss of control), in the form of cakes, ice cream, but not peanuts!

starch reduction? successful. 
* completely free of rice-dependency. 
* Very few fancy breads.
* all the meals were basically without staple starch food
* had some rice + buns on flight

cakes + cookies? indulgence on two buffets + MS office free food + pineapple tarts but luckily I mixed with raw veg, big improvement. I didn't touch the garlic peanuts + love letters. 

home cooking? basically healthy though not low-cal. I avoided starch and fat, but still high cal intake

snacking? cake indulgence is not so good, but most other snacks are whole some
* raw veg made by GM
* yogurt
* fruits
* mongo ice cream

veg (raw or cooked) + fruits? highly successful
ice cream, fried stuff? successful
lean protein? success. Lots of fish and lean meat
nuts? small indulgence at Aerotel
whole milk and yogurt? successful. No loss of control

Q: eating more healthy food ... hoping to suppress appetite for the heavy stuff  -- is it effective?
I did that in two steamboat dinners ...
