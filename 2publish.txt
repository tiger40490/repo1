--new blog: 66kg is too near the upper limit

even 57kg is safe for me

I believe 69 kg would be the upper limit of my green zone, so mid-range is 63kg, not 66kg !

--add to blog on whey
if no temptation, i think one "MRP meal" can last 4 hours. With teptation, it is 20 minutes!

I took 2 level scoops after 8pm 1 Feb. I felt slightly hungry within an hour but didn't eat anything substantial until 10.30pm when wife offered me the left-over noodles

I feel the meal-replacement feature simply doesn't work for me. I get hungry faster than other ppl

consider mixing one scoop MRP + one scoop of whey + teaspoon of chia
:) cheaper than MRP alone
:) precise calorie budgeting and tracking
:) more filling
:( 2 open bottles
