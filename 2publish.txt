--new blog: retirement burn rate is 33% of current
othRisk

Conventional wisedom says 75%. I would say 33% based on SG lifestyle assuming 0 inflation.

My 2016 burn rate analysis shows that only 2k/m is couple core burn rate, so the conventional wisedom estimate is highly misleading.

If I retire in Malaysia then burn rate should be much lower.

--new blog:
my investment strategies since 1997 (milestones only)
the more brief, the better -- oth_risk
1997 started at FSM 
1997 gambled big with family savings (50k+) and lost 11k. Started recording personal investment experiences for review.
2005 big decision to buy #4-116 at a lucky location. Not for investment but rent-saving
2007-2012 (U.S.) suspended all personal investments. Missed big recovery:( Did send USD 90k to Beijing -- dumb luck
2012-2014 fxo + Oanda -> realized I'm only suitable for small scale, low frequency trading. very low ROTI
2012-2016 lots of research and experiments on FSM. Thoroughly disillutioned with commodity funds, EM funds, dividend funds, balanced funds... Made money mostly in U.S. and country-specific equity funds.
2012-2017 lots of discussions and experiments with insurance. Conclusion -- too long too low. While many people seem to use insurance or bonds as the base of a personal portfolio, I dislike these products and use properties instead
2013-14 decision to pay down OC mtg asap
2015 BGC 
2016 BridgeRetail x 2
2015-2017 Jill.. slowly embracing private equity
2018 Energy 12. small but bold experiment
2018 43R ... decided to avoid buying 700k home
2018 CPF-LIFE .. decision to go for smallest amount, since I can foresee my cash flow at that age
2018 college funding -- decided to avoid the ivy league price tag, largely based on UChicago experience
2019 PeakRetail.. decisive
