--new blog: Most c++guys don't understand STL
when I recall the STL interviews, it's clear that majority of c++ app developers use STL every year for 5-10 years almost like a black box. Only 1% has the level of insight as Henry Wu. 

Analogy -- Most of us live in a house without knowing the civil engineering.

Many interviewer questions drill in on one or two everyday STL functionality (everyone would have used), just below the surface. These questions filer out majority of candidates. 不求甚解，不加咀嚼，囫囵吞枣 -- I see it in many Indian developers. That's exactly what these interiew questios are designed to identify and sceen out.

Intellectual curiosity vs intellectual laziness
