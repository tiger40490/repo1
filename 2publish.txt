top 3 bitter setbacks in sg:
* MSFM poor ROI. See tabulation
* long service, moving-up attempts failed 3 times in SG. Self-esteem damaged each time
** Next time I get into a perm job, I will not try so hard
* c++ visible progress was slow; c# visible progress yes but abandoned
.. minor
* FSM and trading as a side project and new direction? Unwhelming exprience... didn't realy bear fruits
