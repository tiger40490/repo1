温故而知新 .. I tend to find bugs + neglected/forgotten parts + areas of improvement. Each part of a given solution can be a show stopper or derailer in a real coding test

====max submatrix using histogram algo
thick->thin? not yet. 

====2-pivot partition
can we simplify it further, after simplifying massively in early Jan 2019

====[Lv] serialize/deserialize binTree

====cycle in binTree
what's the O()?
why is XR saying there's some better solution? There might be!

====abbr gen, longest first

====find all paths in matrix
