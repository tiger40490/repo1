--new blog Empty base-class optimiztion
lowMktVal
This optmization only zeros out the runtime [1] size of baseclass subobject [2]. All other sizes of empty types are the same -- one byte.
   
Suppose Der subclasses B1 and B2.
Note on [1]:
If B1 is empty, then the compile-time operator sizeof() shows sizeof(B1) == 1 not zero, but at run time, the Der object size shows the B1 sub-object has zero size, due to EBCO.

Note on [2]:
If all of Der, B1 and B2 are empty, we know sizeof(Der) == 1, but how about rutime sizeof(an_Der_instance)? Also one, not zero, because this instance is not a baseclass subobject.

--new blog q[Node*] param to a function can be..
A Node address can represent an entire aray of Node objects
If the Node class has a nextNode field, then this param can represent an entire linked list, or head (or any node) of a linked list
If Node class has left and right child nodes, then this param can represent a tree, or a subtree

Q: Can this param represent an array of linked lists? 
A: No. If each element in the array is a Node*, then the array looks like a Node**

--update blog on locking in notify() 
[[DougLea]] P233 points out that pthreads signal() doesn't require the lock being held

--update blog on binary semaphore #CSY (halo88)
[[DougLea]] P220 confirms that in some thread libraries release() can increment a 0/1 binary semaphore value to beyond 1, destroying the mutual exclusion control.

However, java binary semaphore is a mutex because releasing a semaphore before aquiring has no effect but doesn't throw error.

In [[DougLea]] P86, this foremost OO expert briefly noted that it can be best practice to replace a java singleton with an all-static class

--update blog on order cancel and bust
When a trader cancels an order via a FIX connection, she can only cancel the pending portion remaining in the exchange internal orderbook. What was filled is not subject to cancel.

Bust is always initiated by whowever generates the execution report. Beside exchanges, an internal crossing engine at an ibank can issue execution reports and therefore can initiate a bust.

FX interdealer brokers? I don't know if they actually make the crossing decision or the dealers make the decision. I think FX is a quote driven market (Equity is order-driven.) so dealer may have the last look and the freedom to bust an execution.
