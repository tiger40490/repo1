rts parser is 99% stateless but it does need to remember the sequence numbers. In fact sequence number management is crucial.

Before retrans was added to parser, we never sent any retrans request. We did keep track of gaps.

Mostly we used the gap-tracker to check duplicates across Line A/B.

We also relied on our sequence number state to handle sequence resets.
