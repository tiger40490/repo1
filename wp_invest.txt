--new blog: obsessed with passive incomme?
wife pointed it out.

Consulting proves to be very suitable for me but also has swayed me to my current direction -- passive income, semi-retired

Q: Do I want to be landlord like Guang or mgr like Ravi, Josh etc?
A: landlord path is easier and more achievable. Accumulation. Active mgmt also provides gainful employment for wife

1. delay as Megaworld did to me
2. push Jill for the 14k+ payout
3. redeem part of the cnh HY bond fund

--new blog: gold and oil
long term trend is up, but long term can be 30Y. 

No current income. Negative yield actually.

no bargain, but big windfall is possible

--update blog (no hurry): GS 401k
first find out 

Q1: is there any way to avoid the 10% additional tax. If none, then better forget about current income and just hope for a windfall

Is the TargetDate 2025 a solution to Q1?

Q2: which funds promise highest windfall?
I feel U.S. equity funds tend to beat all other funds incl international, comm and bond funds. I don't want to analyze why

There might be a monthly fee around $6.50

Not a bad thing that i didn't buy a 2nd hdb home under gm or sister's name. rental yield would be much lower than cambodia but very stable and safe

--retire in rented home
My mom is now serious about selling her BJ home and live in rented home. She sees a few advantages chiefly sunshine.

We also concluded if CD interest rate remains high at 4% but GRY is 1.5% then they can get substantial extra cash income

--contrary to conventional wisedom, some assets feature higher return, lower risk than the standard assets

* my hdb + bj properties
* [b] german properties
* IPO stocks
* ? high-dividend stocks
* [b] distressed sovreign bond
[b=bargains]
--my recent (since Jan 2019) increase in financial security stems from
* Cambodia cashflow
* nlg about SG medical cost

--popular vs lesser-known financial products
for liquid assets like aapl or eurusd, we can say any information is quickly disseminated so the market price is probably fair. 
for properties in popular (highly liquid but often overpriced) locations, each unit probably receives a fair amount of scrutiny, so deep discount is often due to negative factors.
For bayonne or Cambodia, for each unit the number of serious investors is probably very very low, so bargains are more likely. The amount of unassimilated information is very high, since each investor must wade through lots of raw data and ask many questions.

--update blog: sg for retirement
lower labor cost for most services
higher efficiency not only in government
much less driving required
much cheaper medical cost
virtually zero property tax
old folks don't live in isolation. I can see they need company and human interaction.

common complaints agaisnt SG as a retirement destination
* high cost
* small economy, not "strong" enough, but I feel China and U.S. are actually more unstable
* small space
* too hot
* age-friendly jobs are mostly for doctors or manual laborers

--update blog on OPM reserve
In 1997 I made a similiar mistake by gambling my father's money (put under my care) into commodity futures. I quickly realize I took on a bigger risk than I could afford and immediately i decided to exit at a huge loss.
--new blog: retirement burn rate is 33% of current
Conventional wisedom says 75%. I would say 33% based on SG lifestyle assuming 0 inflation.

My 2016 burn rate analysis shows that most only 2k/m is couple core burn rate, so the conventional wisedom is way off.

If I retire in Malaysia then burn rate should be much lower.

--my investment strategies since 1997 (milestones only)
1997 started at FSM 
1990's IPO's -> stock trading is not my game
1997 gambled big with family savings (50k+) and lost 11k. Started recording personal investment experiences for review.
2005 big decision to buy #4-116 at a lucky location. Not for investment but rent-saving
2007-2012 (U.S.) no personal investment at all. Missed big recovery. Did send USD 90k to Beijing -- dumb luck
2012-present: many investment experiments
2012-2014 fxo + Oanda -> realized I'm only suitable for small scale, low frequency trading. very low ROTI
2012-2016 lots of research and experiments on FSM. Thoroughly disillutioned with commodity funds, EM funds, dividend funds, balanced funds... Made money mostly in U.S. and country-specific equity funds.
2012-2017 lots of discussions and experiments with insurance. Conclusion -- too long too low. While many people seem to use insurance or bonds as the base of a personal portfolio, I dislike these products and use properties instead
2013-14 decision to pay down OC mtg asap
2015 BGC 
2016 BridgeRetail x 2
2015-2017 Jill.. slowly embracing private equity HY bonds
2018 Energy 12. small but bold experiment
2018 43R ... decided to avoid buying 700k home
2018 CPF-LIFE .. decision to go for smallest amount, since I can foresee my cash flow at that age
2018 college funding -- decided to avoid the ivy league price tag, largely based on UChicago experience
2019 PeakRetail.. decisive

--possibly a new blog post, but fairly vague
I have achieved my current comfortable economic position by
* body-building with in-demand tech skills
* education which underlies the other success factors
* high saving rate thanks to very low burn rate
* home-made investment analysis and strategies, adjusted over the years

by "Comfortable" I don't mean above my peers. I mean easy affordable lifestyle without the modern day pressure to work hard and make a living.

--new blog, though I won't consider this investment !
sg condo: everythig extreme, not for a small budget investor like me
lease -- mostly targetting foreigners, but what if they stop coming? what if they realize hdb are cheaper? There are more and more condos in Singapore but foreigners can't keep growing IMHO

rental yield is inferior at downtown, high-end locations, superior in outskirt locations close to MRT.

I believe 2-br units are more in demand as sg is very attractive for executives with family

in a down turn, I guess the less attractive rental properties may get a hit, such as remote locations or studios

SG condo investors mostly looking for appreciation, but I'm more interested in rental income, not a strong feature of sg condos

12% tax on buyers of 2nd home... way too high. That's why some sell their hdb but I can't do that.

6-person/unit including babies? I guess strict enforcement is hard

--new blog -- polyclinic xp: elderly healthcare
I spent quite a bit of time on my multiple polyclinic trips and there's an unexpected ROTI. 

For whatever reasons, the patients at TPY polyclinic are mostly elderly. Semiconsciously I started to see myself in them, and recognized, at a physical and emotional level, the SG advantage over U.S. system, where ordinary (mid-curve) old folks get significantly less help than the wealthy old folks able to afford private healthcare. U.S. healthcare wellfare targets the low-income tail of the bell curve. As the U.S. debates how to make healthcare more affordable, Singapore is quietly adapting and modernizing an already proven formula of efficient yet affordable healthycare for ordinary old folks, not only the needy. 

The Singapore system is largely based on polyclinics and subsidies at public hospitals + private clinics.

Efficient yet affordable -- fast, modern, well-staffed. system is less complicated, more understood.

Conclusion at the personal level -- My recent polyclinic experiences help foster a growing self-reassure that as long as we maintain our Singapore citizenship, we don't need to earmark a huge sum for our elderly medical needs. Until recently, I used mostly private clinics, which are still a fraction of the cost in U.S. 

I would guess very few governments take care of their ordinary old citizens so well.

Q: In 20Y when I grow old will the SG system deteriorate?
A: I have reason to believe it won't.

I now feel the elderly medical cost + daily living is rather affordable despite SG's reputation, but this is a feeling not really based on facts
--2013 ideas on retirement
Disclaimer -- I'm not seriously retirement-planning. Just random thoughts. The [1][2].. items are my retirement ideas.

I feel many people rely on their home as retirement, but you can't easily get cash out of the house. So it doesn't really generate cash needed in retirement.  It's rather important to ensure the home can be rented out to generate supplementary income [1].The better the location, the more likely. It would be idea if you can get a 2nd, perhaps small home to rent out. 

Another common thing people do is full time investing (gambling). I'm not sure at all. I'd rather leave my money with the professional fund managers. I'm more in favour of high-dividend investments.

If I have the time and good health, and needs money, I'm more in favour of working into old age[2]. Some professions are easier to find work - such as hourly work. Teaching is one field to offer work into old age.

Medical insurance [3] is quite important, esp. for catastrophic, or chronic.

Annuity [4] is a relevant option to me.
