--new blog: cpf-life: I will live past 90
I may live till 90's, so Consider taking early payout but at 55 sink in large quantum to maximize the high return given by government?

inflation risk is higher over longer horizon.

My own investments also pose higher risks over longer horizons
--new blog: ##y renting is less Undesirable]U.S.than SG
U.S. property tax erodes home ownership benefits, esp. in tri-state
U.S. appreciation is lackluster in most cities beside the top 20
U.S. mtg rate is higher
U.S. repair cost is higher due to labor cost + older wooden structure

--add to blog on my peers ffree
I think too few of them focused on reliable, consistent passive income

Apparently their "tolerable" burn rate is a few times higher than my level in Singapore

--new blog: obsessed with passive income?
wife pointed it out, hopefully false alarm

I want to continue to improve my ffree profile by increasing my passive income

Consulting proves to be very suitable for me but also has swayed me to my current direction -- passive income, semi-retired

Q: Do I want to be landlord like Guang or mgr like Ravi, Josh etc?
A: landlord path is easier and more achievable. Accumulation. Active mgmt also provides gainful employment for wife

--update blog on BGC settlement
1. delay as Megaworld did to me. Logically no penalty. Delay until USD strengthens or HY recovers
3. redeem part of the cnh HY bond fund
4. convert more usd via changeAlley or fsm
last resort -- borrow 20k from wife, breaking my plan to rebuild OPM reserve

--new blog: gold
long term trend is up, but long term can be 20Y. 

No current income. Negative yield actually. google -> Ask Ashish

no bargain, but big windfall is possible

--update blog (no hurry): GS 401k
first find out 

Q1: is there any way to avoid the 10% additional tax. If none, then better forget about current income and just hope for a windfall

Is the TargetDate 2025 a solution to Q1?

Q2: which funds promise highest windfall?
I feel U.S. equity funds tend to beat all other funds incl international, comm and bond funds. I don't want to analyze why

There might be a monthly fee around $6.50

Not a bad thing that i didn't buy a 2nd hdb home under gm or sister's name. rental yield would be much lower than cambodia though very stable and safe

--retire in rented home
My mom is now serious about selling her BJ home and live in rented home. She sees a few advantages chiefly sunshine.

We also concluded if CD interest rate remains high at 4% but GRY is 1.5% then they can get substantial extra cash income

--contrary to conventional wisedom, some assets feature higher return, lower risk than the standard assets, but not obvious so insight or due diligence are required.
* [b] my cambodia shops
* my hdb + bj properties
* [b] german properties
* IPO stocks
* ? high-dividend stocks
* [b] distressed sovreign bond
[b=bargains]
--my recent (since Jan 2019) increase in financial security stems from
* Cambodia cashflow
* nlg about SG medical cost

--popular vs lesser-known financial products
for liquid assets like aapl or eurusd, we can say any information is quickly disseminated so the market price is probably fair. 
for properties in popular (highly liquid but often overpriced) locations, each unit probably receives a fair amount of scrutiny, so deep discount is often due to negative factors.

In Bayonne or Cambodia, for each unit the number of serious investors is probably very very low, so bargains are more likely. The amount of unassimilated information is very high, since each investor must wade through lots of raw data and ask many questions.

--update blog: sg for retirement
lower labor cost for most services
higher efficiency not only in government
driving -- much less required
medical -- much cheaper
property tax -- virtually no impact on retirement cash flow

old folks don't live in isolation. I can see many (me included) need company and human interaction. I don't want to retire in a rural area

common complaints agaisnt SG as a retirement destination
* high cost
* small economy, not "strong" enough, but I feel China and U.S. are actually more unstable
* small space
* too hot
* age-friendly jobs are mostly for doctors or manual laborers

--new blog: myShield co-payment rider
co-payment is not negligible... so better
* read online
* email my quesions to Colin Tan

--update blog on OPM reserve
In 1997 I made a similiar mistake by gambling my father's money (put under my care) into commodity futures. I quickly realize I took on a bigger risk than I could afford and immediately i decided to exit at a huge loss.

--possibly a new blog post, but fairly vague
I have achieved my current comfortable Economic profile by
* body-building with in-demand tech skills
* keeping burn rate low -- efficiency inspied by SG gov
* high saving rate thanks to burn rate + decent salary
* SGP citizenships
* home-made investment analysis and strategies, adjusted over the years
** lucrative investments in #4-116 and BJ
* education which underlies the other success factors
* staying healthy

by "Comfortable" I don't mean above my peers. I mean easily affordable lifestyle without the modern day pressure to work hard and make a living.

--new blog, though I won't consider this investment !
sg condo: everythig extreme, not for a small budget investor like me
lease -- mostly targetting foreigners, but what if they stop coming? what if they realize hdb are cheaper? There are more and more condos in Singapore but foreigners can't keep growing IMHO

rental yield is inferior at downtown, high-end locations, superior in outskirt locations close to MRT.

I believe 2-br units are more in demand as sg is very attractive for executives with family

in a down turn, I guess the less attractive rental properties may get a hit, such as remote locations or studios

SG condo investors mostly looking for appreciation, but I'm more interested in rental income, not a strong feature of sg condos

12% tax on buyers of 2nd home... way too high. That's why some sell their hdb but I can't do that.

6-person/unit including babies? I guess strict enforcement is hard

--new blog -- polyclinic xp: elderly healthcare
I spent quite a bit of time on my multiple polyclinic trips and there's an unexpected ROTI. 

For whatever reasons, the patients at TPY polyclinic are mostly elderly. Semiconsciously I started to see myself in them, and recognized, at a physical and emotional level, the SG advantage over U.S. system, where ordinary (mid-curve) old folks get significantly less help than the wealthy old folks able to afford private healthcare. U.S. healthcare wellfare targets the low-income tail of the bell curve. As the U.S. debates how to make healthcare more affordable, Singapore is quietly adapting and modernizing an already proven formula of efficient yet affordable healthycare for ordinary old folks, not only the needy. 

The Singapore system is largely based on polyclinics and subsidies at public hospitals + private clinics.

Efficient yet affordable -- fast, modern, well-staffed. system is less complicated, more understood.

Conclusion at the personal level -- My recent polyclinic experiences help foster a growing self-reassure that as long as we maintain our Singapore citizenship, we don't need to earmark a huge sum for our elderly medical needs. Until recently, I used mostly private clinics, which are still a fraction of the cost in U.S. 

I would guess very few governments take care of their ordinary old citizens so well.

Q: In 20Y when I grow old will the SG system deteriorate?
A: I have reason to believe it won't.

I now feel the elderly medical cost + daily living is rather affordable despite SG's reputation, but this is a feeling not really based on facts

--2013 ideas on retirement
Disclaimer -- I'm not seriously retirement-planning. Just random thoughts. The [1][2].. items are my retirement ideas.

I feel many people rely on their home as retirement, but you can't easily get cash out of the house. So it doesn't really generate cash needed in retirement.  It's rather important to ensure the home can be rented out to generate supplementary income [1].The better the location, the more likely. It would be idea if you can get a 2nd, perhaps small home to rent out. 

Another common thing people do is full time investing (gambling). I'm not sure at all. I'd rather leave my money with the professional fund managers. I'm more in favour of high-dividend investments.

If I have the time and good health, and needs money, I'm more in favour of working into old age[2]. Some professions are easier to find work - such as hourly work. Teaching is one field to offer work into old age.

Medical insurance [3] is quite important, esp. for catastrophic, or chronic.

Annuity [4] is a relevant option to me.
