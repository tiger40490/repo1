Q1: is there any way to avoid the 10% additional tax. If none, then better forget about current income and just hope for a windfall

Is the TargetDate 2025 a solution to Q1?

Q2: which funds promise highest windfall?
I feel U.S. equity funds tend to beat all other funds incl international, comm and bond funds. I don't want to analyze why

There might be a monthly fee around $6.50

Not a bad thing that i didn't buy a 2nd hdb home under gm or sister's name. rental yield would be much lower than cambodia though very stable and safe

--retire in rented home
My mom is now serious about selling her BJ home and live in rented home. She sees a few advantages chiefly sunshine.

We also concluded if CD interest rate remains high at 4% but GRY is 1.5% then they can get substantial extra cash income

--possibly a new blog post, but fairly vague
I have achieved my current comfortable Economic profile by

* high saving rate thanks to burn rate + decent salary
* SGP citizenships
* home-made investment analysis and strategies, adjusted over the years
** lucrative investments in #4-116 and BJ

by "Comfortable" I don't mean above my peers. I mean easily affordable lifestyle without the modern day pressure to work hard and make a living.

--2013 ideas on retirement
Disclaimer -- I'm not seriously retirement-planning. Just random thoughts. The [1][2].. items are my retirement ideas.

I feel many people rely on their home as retirement, but you can't easily get cash out of the house. So it doesn't really generate cash needed in retirement.  It's rather important to ensure the home can be rented out to generate supplementary income [1].The better the location, the more likely. It would be idea if you can get a 2nd, perhaps small home to rent out. 

Another common thing people do is full time investing (gambling). I'm not sure at all. I'd rather leave my money with the professional fund managers. I'm more in favour of high-dividend investments.

If I have the time and good health, and needs money, I'm more in favour of working into old age[2]. Some professions are easier to find work - such as hourly work. Teaching is one field to offer work into old age.

Medical insurance [3] is quite important, esp. for catastrophic, or chronic.

Annuity [4] is a relevant option to me.
