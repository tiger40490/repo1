Long term div income over 10Y or longer? I am not sure. I feel utility stocks are safer, like T:us

short term div income like 1-2Y? I feel utility stocks are "safer" but I will try some REITs

--what div stocks to market-buy and what to buy with GTC
* high div REIT: market-buy if low quantum and highly rated
* blue chip @5%: market-buy if low quantum and highly rated
* light-blue chip @6%: GTC

mkt buy is slightly lower tcost .. no monitoring
mkt buy is slightly risky

Likewise, Maybe it would be good to avoid a 4th Cambodia shop

Disposable income is higher in Singapore than U.S.
