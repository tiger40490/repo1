--sg condo: everythig extreme, not for a small budget investor like me
lease -- mostly targetting foreigners, but what if they stop coming? what if they realize hdb are cheaper? There are more and more condos in Singapore but foreigners can't keep growing IMHO

rental yield is inferior at downtown, high-end locations, superior in outskirt locations close to MRT.

I believe 2-br units are more in demand as sg is very attractive for executives with family

in a down turn, I guess the less attractive rental properties may get a hit, such as remote locations or studios

SG condo investors mostly looking for appreciation, but I'm more interested in rental income, not a strong feature of sg condos

12% tax on buyers of 2nd home... way too high. That's why some sell their hdb but I can't do that.

6-person/unit including babies? I guess strict enforcement is hard

--popular vs lesser-known financial products
for liquid assets like aapl or eurusd, we can say any information is quickly disseminated so the market price is probably fair. 
for properties in popular (highly liquid but often overpriced) locations, each unit probably receives a fair amount of scrutiny, so deep discount is often due to negative factors.
For bayonne or Cambodia, for each unit the number of serious investors is probably very very low, so bargains are more likely. The amount of unassimilated information is very high, since each investor must wade through lots of raw data and ask many questions.
