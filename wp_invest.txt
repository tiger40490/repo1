Not a bad thing that i didn't buy a 2nd hdb home under gm or sister's name. rental yield would be much lower than cambodia though very stable and safe

achieved%%comfortable economic profile

I have achieved my current comfortable Economic profile by
* body-building with in-demand tech skills
* keeping burn rate low -- efficiency inspired by SG gov
* high saving rate thanks to burn rate + decent salary
* SGP citizenships
* home-made investment analysis and strategies, adjusted over the years
** lucrative investments in #4-116 and BJ
* staying healthy

by "Comfortable" I don't mean above my peers. I mean easily affordable lifestyle without the modern day pressure to work hard and make a living.

--2013 ideas on retirement
Disclaimer -- I'm not seriously retirement-planning. Just random thoughts. The [1][2].. items are my retirement ideas.

I feel many people rely on their home as retirement, but you can't easily get cash out of the house. So it doesn't really generate cash needed in retirement.  It's rather important to ensure the home can be rented out to generate supplementary income [1].The better the location, the more likely. It would be idea if you can get a 2nd, perhaps small home to rent out. 

Another common thing people do is full time investing (gambling). I'm not sure at all. I'd rather leave my money with the professional fund managers. I'm more in favour of high-dividend investments.

If I have the time and good health, and needs money, I'm more in favour of working into old age[2]. Some professions are easier to find work - such as hourly work. Teaching is one field to offer work into old age.

Medical insurance [3] is quite important, esp. for catastrophic, or chronic.

Annuity [4] is a relevant option to me.
