--new blog: ground floor to run daycare
rent a 3-4k home with big ground floor to run a small Chinese language daycare.

My family can use 2nd floor. 3rd floor can sublease out. Part of ground floor can be my storage.

Safe location not necessarily Chinese concentration. Jersey City and Hoboken is fine.

May need an asistant in case wife is sick.

Long term div income over 10Y or longer? I am not sure. I feel utility stocks are safer, like T:us

short term div income like 1-2Y? I feel utility stocks are "safer" but I will try some REITs

--what div stocks to market-buy and what to buy with GTC
* high div REIT: market-buy if low quantum and highly rated
* blue chip @5%: market-buy if low quantum and highly rated
* light-blue chip @6%: GTC

mkt buy is slightly lower tcost .. no monitoring
mkt buy is slightly risky

Not a bad thing that i didn't buy a 2nd hdb home under gm or sister's name. rental yield would be much lower than cambodia though very stable and safe

Likewise, Maybe it would be good to avoid a 4th Cambodia shop
