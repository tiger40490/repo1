====Q [c str] longest palindrome subsequence
I think some non-optional solution is feasible. start with some good (extreme) examples
eg alabama -> aabaa
eg mississippi -> ississi
eg philippines -> pilip

--solution 1: generate all abbr and check each but at some point we may have enough confidence to terminate the search

====Q[c L]: sort a list in O(N logN) but constant space? 
I think swap is way to go, but recursion stack space? iterative?

--merge sort using an aux array of same size
1) divide the array into 2^j segments each up to 2 elements, rembering the (segment) boundaries.
2) sort each segment
3) merge first 2 segments and output to a new array of N but only use the first few slots
4) similarly , merge 3rd and 4th segments into the new array, using the next few slots
Once we merge all pairs, entire new array is populated and old array can be reset to 0 and usable as a blank array
Now the segment boundaries are updated and reduced by half. When segment count becomes 2, we would be on the last merge.
5) repeat Step 3

In total we visit each of N nodes logN times

====Q[Lv] 60%: Given array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one in a linear runtime. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

well-defined problem:)
greedy?
O(1) space probably means swapping
mutable?
-- with more space, I can use a hashtable to achieve O(N)
-- My O(N) algo {applicable for any-size integers and also other than "three"}: Pick a random pivot and partition in O(N) time and O(1) space. Also keep track how many repetitions of the pivot value (probably 3). Exclude the pivot value, count size of both partitions and discard the one whose size=3X. Repeat.

====Q[c !e L !v] 50%: Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*'. No dot !
I think we can modify the existing solution. No need for an optimal solution

=====Q[L] 60%: Given an array nums of K integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero. Doable in O(KK)
%%A: separate into (M) non-negatives and (N) negatives. M+N=K. get (NN) pairs among negatives .... and look up the sum in a pre-populated hash table of M items.
O(NN + MM), smaller than O( [N+M]^2 )
test in leetcode? No obligation

====Q[c e v] implemet half-written abbr_iterative.h based on the abbr_ascendRecursive.h
Not so easy when the word is not sorted and container dupe letters. I think hashtable is needed

====Q[Lv] 80%: Leetcode problem 17... Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations (not permutations) that the number could represent.

2: abc
3: def
4: ghi
5: jkl
6: mno
7: pqrs
8: tuv
9: wxyz

Example:

Input: "23"
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]. 

--we need good variable names. 
For the 9 digits, every digit is immediately mapped to a name string like '2' -> "er" and I hope not to use the digits any more.

To minimize confusion, Create typedef LOB for either vector<char> or the string form

struct Bundle{
  set<vector<char>> clubOfWords; 
  size_t repeatOfThisButton;
  LOB lob; //compile-time constant
};
The utility function would be
Bundle gen(vector<char> const & lob /*lettersOnOneButton*/ , int repeat). This function is fairly simple. for er_5, we have 3^5 possible words in the club

sort input into 222223444 then create map: 
"er_5" -> a bundle
"san1" -> a bundle
"si_3" -> a bundle

A major Miletone is when the map is populated with the clubs. Now generate combos ... better use "append" approach.
