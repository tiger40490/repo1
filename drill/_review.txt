温故而知新 .. I tend to find bugs + neglected/forgotten parts + areas of improvement. Each part of a given solution can be a show stopper or derailer in a real coding test
 
====Q (update existing code) serialize a BST
Use addr as node id
Each node is serialized as "id|val|leftId|rightId"
====It's relatively easy n enjoyable to review some of the classicGenerators problems.

====continuousSentence:

====(cpp) water container
====2-pivot partition
