====Q: insertion sort quick-n-dirty but correct
====Q[c L]: sort a list in O(N logN) but constant space? 
I think swap is way to go, but recursion stack space? iterative?

--O(1) space solution
Get a quick estimate of the median. 
Then move two pointers from far ends towards center.
Whenever med < left item,  freeze left ptr.
Whenever right item < med, freeze right ptr.
when both pointers stoped, swap them, then unfreeze both.

Now list is partitioned into two halves. Now divide and conquer. Total logN scans.

--O[N] space (not O[1]) idea
merge sort using an aux array of same size
1) divide the array into 2^j segments each up to 2 elements, rembering the (segment) boundaries.
2) sort each segment
3) merge first 2 segments and output to a new array of N but only use the first few slots
4) similarly , merge 3rd and 4th segments into the new array, using the next few slots
Once we merge all pairs, entire new array is populated and old array can be reset to 0 and usable as a blank array
Now the segment boundaries are updated and reduced by half. When segment count becomes 2, we would be on the last merge.
5) repeat Step 3

In total we visit each of N nodes logN times

====Q[Lv] 60%: Given array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one in a linear runtime. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

well-defined problem:)
greedy?
O(1) space probably means swapping
mutable?
-- with more space, I can use a hashtable to achieve O(N)
-- My O(N) algo {applicable for any-size integers and also other than "three"}: Pick a random pivot and partition in O(N) time and O(1) space. Also keep track how many repetitions of the pivot value (probably 3). Exclude the pivot value, count size of both partitions and discard the one whose size=3X. Repeat.

====Q[c !e L !v] 50%: Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*'. No dot !
I think we can modify the existing solution. No need for an optimal solution

=====Q[L] 60%: Given an array nums of K integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero. Doable in O(KK)
%%A: separate into (M) non-negatives and (N) negatives. M+N=K. get (NN) pairs among negatives .... and look up the sum in a pre-populated hash table of M items.
O(NN + MM), smaller than O( [N+M]^2 )
