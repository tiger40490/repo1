====binge
In most flights, binge is technical impossible thanks to rationing. However sometimes I could get unlimited ice cream, etc.

#1 croissant -- more calorie dense than the others
#2 oily biscuits and chips -- tasty? Not even close to ice cream but often more calorie dense !! therefore a lousy deal so need to be absolutely conscious and aware
#3 shelled, salted nuts -- always always less tasty than my own, so stay alert and don't mindlessly consume. Just refuse when offered
* ice cream -- luckly no-buffet so at most I ate 3 times, up to 1000 cal
* chocolate -- buffet style in CX, but luckly I don't have the habit of eating big chunks
* wine -- luckly not addictive. I think one cup is fine. Two is not worthwhile since it doesn't satisfy any craving

====set-up upon boarding # best practices
* Cash -- as explained elsewhere, need to keep on the body
* passport + wallet -- can put in one holder and dump in the spinner or backpack
* laptop -- put below seat or in compartment for each access
* water bottle to encourage hydration
* cushions -- below seat or in compartment
* jacket + cap -- leave in backpack ... easier to retrieve when cold
* salt water + dental kit -- seat pocket
* avoid opening the zipped spinner. Always a hassle. Take out stuff in advance, in advance, in advance!
* pencils x 3
