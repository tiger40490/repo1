--oily starch (including the paste on fried chicken skin) feels worse than ice cream or sugary drinks
--"eat only when hungry" guideline proven completely ineffective on this trip
* proven tip: focus on starch (don't give up completely) after breaking this guideline. This guideline is no immediate death sentence, so don't give up.
* survival tip for boy and dad: avoid temptation
* sugg for boy: get used to skipping meals on a regular basis. It will help in the long run.
* Don't blame wife/gm cooking. i chose to face the temptation and lost
--boy isn't as addicted to ice cream as I am. He chose fruit juice, drinks and chendol instead
--boy agreed to jog for 9 minutes and cycle for 9 minutes. The attitude alone is commendable.
--productivity concept
Wasted human potential is more apparent in PHL than SGP

Q: On flight or MRT, in hind sight would I feel regretful to study/think or to engage with boy?
A: if boy opens up then it's worth it. After some amount of engagement we hit diminishing return

reading, assimilating, blogging about parenting, wellness, marriage .... can have direct, tangible benefits if put into practice. I wrote many posts on these topics. The act of writing feels productive though roti is zero

--腾飞 in BGC properties is less likely than in Chinese cities presumably because Chinese investors prefer first-tier metropollis like London, Toronto, Sydney etc. Mind share remains low for Manila.

--Mind museum posed the question "Which city is best for you?"
Q: u want to commute by rail, subway, or walk/cycle?
A: for me, rush hour train frequency is important, so bus and rail are not good enough

Q: how far from city center do you wan to live?
A: I used to prefer closer, but now I think 1-hour distance is acceptable given my new thinking on productivity

Q: Do you have a family or as a single?

====boy's improvement
以前爸爸记得大宝只能读懂幼儿读物， 现在上千字小学低年级中文故事能读懂。 带拼音的。 细微词义把握不准（考试要求）， 但理解大意没问题（读报足够）. 
钢琴那一两首 听起来挺娴熟的。 弹出节奏一直是难点，大宝稍有改进。 可能比不上某些孩子，但比没学过的人强多了。 其实没必要比别人。
华文补习每周都有作业要背几句范文， 还有时要默写。 以前大宝最没兴致，没自觉性，这几天不用提醒他都知道要完成。 可能也因为放假了没别的作业。
--letter to boy
大宝， 11 月 21 日我们俩办完签证后，爸爸本来应该睡觉 2 到 3 小时， 之后要坐飞机 27 小时。 爸爸当时没有想到需要睡觉。 如果爸爸一下午在家， 或许会睡一下。 但事实上我们5点多出去找脚车8点才回来， 吃了晚饭就没多少时间了。 

晚上爸爸一直都很累，现在爸爸知道是因为早上 8 点就起床了。

我们还是跑了 400 米的， 后来也买到了Speaker 和新电池， 有点收获， 回头看， 爸爸不在乎浪费了 10 元（Grab，OFO 打不开，车费）， 爸爸在乎的是花了太多时间， 造成晚上太忙了， 没有必要的。

爸爸不怪大宝。 爸爸是自己做的选择。 有几点教训值得反思：
* 我们没有想到找OFO / MOBIKE 脚车需要至少 15 分钟， 还有可能 30 分钟找不到而只好放弃。 如果时间紧迫就不应该冒这个风险。 
* 11月21日下午是时间不够的， 我现在回头看才知道
* 我们不应该又去森林大厦， 因为6.30的时候，爸爸所剩的时间太少了。
* 我们四点多用 Grab 叫车， 没料到出了差错， 不能全怪你。 虽然用 Grab 好几次了， 但我们还是不熟悉。 
* 虽然爸爸疼大宝， 希望能满足大宝去麦礼芝骑脚车的愿望， 但这次不是最好的时候。

====unbroken (mastered in 0.txt)
* remote productivity better than feared. I might outperform myself even more if I spent more hours at work.
* diet better than feared -- about 40% lower. I think I would feel much better by skipping home dinner a few times, and eating raw carrot more often
* reunions were satisfying, immediate and without difficulty, better than feared
* boy's weight maintained
* boy's grades
* boy's Chinese reading / renzi
* my health on long flights
* my swim/jogging/chin-up
* the $40 bike
* iview laptop didn't fail as feared
* BGC

====lucky
Jetstar fx rate very reasonable
FDW commitment -- much more flexible than feared
wrist watch self-healed
discovered the wonderful google-sheets
ofo/mobike worked for boy

====am still bigger than the challenges
diet ] ff very well maintained
weight under control

====well-done on this trip
discovered boy's acceptance of jogging
grand2 upgrade research done without a trip. No more doubt
BGC payment - huge research effort
found remittance trick
found maybank khm TT solution
proved that my productivitity can be very high in SGP office

====as planned:
exam review with boy? completed efficiently as planned
read the 2 tech books from NY? yes
bonding with boy on the numerous trips? yes

--XR and I both tend to be too keenly aware of inadequacies/limitations/weaknesses in self and our kids. Inferiority?

Rationally, even if a kid is less brainy than average in class, he/she can still be adequate i.e. good enough.

--Now is seller's market so some people bid 7% above the asking to snatch up a unit. These aggressive buyers need good knowledge about the location

--improvement (like new kitchen) to a house leads to faster appreciation than on a condo
#1 advantage of condo is price tag

--long flight
The shorter segment is always much lighter strain on the body. Less severe effects of long sleep-deprivation and "confinement"-induced muscle stiffness .

It pays to reduce the duration of the long segment, so avoid HK or Guangzhou.

Only HK and BJ provide airside hourly hotel.

--I used to feel zbs will make me a great contributor to any system, but now I realize localSys is more important.

In Citi muni, I wanted to use remote debugging to understand how the localsys worked, but even the best tool was only helping me in the battle between my brain power and the cummulative brain power sunk in

--movies for future flights
Flight to NY is more stressful, so consider movies. No guilt. Consider Einstein and grandpa. I want to be kind to myself as I am to my kids.

If can sleep then no need for movie.

* Favor Jap, Chinese. In the emotional genres, western movies never touched me except [[ForrestGump]], [[CuriousCase]]. 
* The most touching movies tend to be love, family...
* Favor adaptations of books
* favor award winners (except special effects award) -- minimum quality standard
* avoid action or crime genres.
* avoid superheros or scifi genres
* avoid period drama
* avoid romantic comedies .. too light-hearted, not serious enough.

Here are some promising titles

[[捍卫者]] 历史
[[遇上世界上另一个你]] Jap love story
