--new blogpost: 45-min commute when living with/out family
After my son was born in NY, my 50-minute commute (Hamilton) vs 35-min commute (Newport) felt very differnt
1-hr commute feels OK at mvea because ... no family and low workload
living with family, i predict i would again feel a big difference of 15 min change in commute

Many people feel such a prediction is highly unreliable, but I feel past experience is very reliable

staying with family, I get basically no time for study and very limited time for blogging.. about 5hr/week but I need 20-40 hr/week !!

--healthy diet tips given by SG HPB #orange
recommended -- sugar substitutes; sugar-free drinks; Chinese tea
orange is safe even though not leanest. Orange is not as low-cal as some veg but Singapore HPB (and many experts would agree) picked orange as the safest food.
