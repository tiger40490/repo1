--new blog: 45-min commute when living with/out family
After my son was born in NY, my 50-minute commute (Hamilton) vs 35-min commute (Newport) felt very differnt
1-hr commute feels OK at mvea because ... no family and low workload
living with family, i predict i would again appreciate 15 min difference in commute
Many people feel prediction is highly unreliable, but I feel past experience is very reliable

blogging on laptop often feels some progress on career, kids, investment, ..
Not burn/rot but I ought to reduce that obsession
As a comparison,how do i feel about yogao or coding drill..?

for lengthy blogging ..
laptop feels better than pencil + postit
--new blog ..
am i too preoccupied with PIP stigma? Spending this much time is probably unproductive.

The risk is real. So long as I have no thoughts about the topic i should keep working on it?

my tech xx can't be driven completely by IV. I would end up chasing the tails in jxee...
my tech xx can't be driven completely by the elusive concept of zbs.
my tech xx can't be driven by rank promotion including GTD as promotion is likely due to multiple factors

my c# xx journey was exciting but .. In contrast, my core-java/c++ (not jxee) journey has generated superior ROTI because 
* the topics are stable and 
* I was able to stick to these career directions

However, most of the java5 features are out of fashion in interviews. How about j8 features?
--workload concerns even when peers are not faster than me
Daniel Yan cited the factor of imposed deadline by exchange
Another person cited the fire-fighting mode
CSDoctor said in some companies like Huawei, there's unhealthy culture of long hours in the office, eroding family time, but i think this is rare nowadays. 
Most stressful "high performance" teams emphasize output and intensity ("productivity" and "efficiency") ... remember Kevin.

for my reflection writing, i prefer printout + real keyboard + postit.
other thinkers may rely on their brain alone.

--new blog conscious food decisions@flight
This is a intriguing context -- very limited choices..
* butter spread -- I'm able to resist
* chocolate/icecream -- I never resist
* crossant -- I find it hard to resist
* creamy food (fatty) -- i find it hard to resist

Pattern -- calorie density is extreme in fat, but luckily in small amount
Pattern -- starch is alsso hard to resist
--new log success@concurrency features ] java^c++^c# 
[tags t_othRisk]
I'm biased towards java.

I feel c# concurrenncy is less impactful because most of the important concurrent systems use *nix servers not windows, and most concurrent programming jobs do not go to windows developers

Outside windows, c++ concurrency is mostly based on the C library pthreads, non-OO and clumbsy.

The c++11 thread classes are the next generation but not widely used.

Java concurrency support is the most successful, well-designed from the beginning and extremely stable. It's simpler than c++11 thread classes. More than half the java interviews would ask threading, because java threading is understandable by the average programmer.
--overloaded .. which one to lg?
diet without zsms? challenging .. spend more on fancy, convenient foods

how do I manage this risk?
Always git commit before closing file
make backup copies
--update blog: research .. why is rice pudding so delicious but moderate calorie? 
Is it due to low fat, relatively low sugar and high water content?

how to be less hard pushing?
how to reward myself more?
--where to put the reminder below? Put in on google calendar once a day
"alt-shift -- changes input language as the windows standard"
--since 2007, very few examples of "effort->ROTI" including financial ROTI
(vague, not worth publishing)
* c++/C#/java IV pass rate
* pure algo IV pass rate
* online timed coding IV pass rate
* passive income growing including Energy12
* diet

--d-resort review (low value ... avoid Oth)
:) as planned, did some stretching and coding drill
:) as planned, boy did lots of math 
:) as planned, wild wild wet + buffet but overeating to be badly bloated

i didn't celebrate/reward myself enough esp. for the stretching and coding drill

--healthy diet tips given by SG HPB #orange
recommended -- sugar substitutes; sugar-free drinks; Chinese tea
orange is safe even though not leanest. Orange is not as low-cal as some veg but Singapore HPB (and many experts would agree) picked orange as the safest food.

a food with 0g fat or 0% DV of fat still has fat if calories from fat is nonzero
