--when to transfer final peak amt?
next week is fine, but i prefer to offload this (heavy) item asap. I have too many balls in the air like BGC final payment; sgd cash crunch

--where to put a reminder?
alt-shift -- changes input language as the windows standard 

google calendar once a day

--new blog: CNY trip diet review
In terms of weight (and probably calorie) ... not so effective. I would guess my weight (in Retro) would be 64kg so I plan to bring it down gradually back to 63 and 62.5 kg
In terms of nutrition ... high quliaty
In terms of self-control and daily battles? won some lost some
:) rice at home
:) stayed away from peanuts + love letters + cakeHistory 
:( cakes -- offce free food

biggest enemy remains temptations (+ the ensuing loss of control), in the form of cakes, ice cream, but not peanuts!

starch reduction? successful. 
* completely free of rice-dependency. 
* Very few fancy breads.
* all the meals were basically without staple starch food
* had some rice + buns on flight

cakes + cookies? indulgence on two buffets + MS office free food + pineapple tarts but luckily I mixed with raw veg, big improvement. I didn't touch the garlic peanuts + love letters. 

home cooking? basically healthy though not low-cal. I avoided starch and fat, but still high cal intake

snacking? cake indulgence is not so good, but most other snacks are whole some
* raw veg made by GM
* yogurt
* fruits
* mongo ice cream

veg (raw or cooked) + fruits? highly successful
ice cream, fried stuff? successful
lean protein? success. Lots of fish and lean meat
nuts? small indulgence at Aerotel
whole milk and yogurt? successful. No loss of control

Q: eating more healthy food ... hoping to suppress appetite for the heavy stuff  -- is it effective?
I did that in two steamboat dinners ...

--polyclinic takeaway
* from U.S. make ttsh appt for Mar
* all the liver tests? no issue 
* yellow? probbly due to carrot, after reviewing all the tests
* carrot continue? OK
* drive towards 60kg? Doc said OK. I would say go all-out
* even 57kg is safe for me? No comment
* I believe 69 kg would be the upper limit of my green zone
* lower end of bmi green zone doesn't imply low cholesterol

--healthy diet tips given by SG HPB #orange
#1 tip -- reduce animal fat
cakes and bbq meat -- portion control
recommended -- steaming, boiling, roasting
recommended -- sugar substitues; sugarfree drinks; chinese tea
orange is safe even though not leanest. Orange is not as low-cal as some veg but Singapore HPB (and many experts would agree) picked orange as the safest food. Much safer than most foods we eat during a festive season. I would say the same about the MRP.

--new blog: [19] living my dream life
These are elements of the dream life I envisioned 5..20 years ago:

beautiful kids + wife. Stable family
health -- bmi, sleep ..
debt free; concrete, spacious home paid off
reliable passive incomes
active mind, hightly relevant to the current economy
job security, arguably even higher than the FTE

--new blog (vague):
bitter setbacks since mid 2012 as I look back in 2019:
* MSFM poor ROI. See tabulation
* long service, moving-up attempts failed 3 times in SG. Self-esteem damaged each time
* c++ visible progress is slow; c# visible progress yes but abandoned
* FSM and trading as a side project and new direction? didn't realy bear fruits 

Now I feel failed attempts are part of life for everyone of us unless you don't make any attempt. It's irresponsible to avoid reviewing those unsuccessful attempts, but let's not be too fixated on the negatives. 

It is more useful and motivating to spot and perceive the positives -- progress, breakthrough, unexpected longevity... 

Below I use the number of stars to denote the difficulty level + significance of each positive:
** Beijing and khm properties
** boy did OK in P4 major exam -- science and Eng esp. strong performance
** boy sticking to piano and swimming
* meimei showing absorbency
* kids' Chinese showing big progress
** my wellness maintained, and even improved slightly
* 2018 weight and diet improvement
* reunions are satisfying
*** 2015-2018 c++ breakthrough (including technical wins) in the body-building contest
* java body-building contest -- I remain confident
** coding drill -- visible and invisible progresses

--add to blog on whey
if no temptation, i think one "MRP meal" can last 4 hours. With teptation, it is 20 minutes!

I took 2 level scoops after 8pm 1 Feb. I felt slightly hungry within an hour but didn't eat anything substantial until 10.30pm when wife offered me the left-over noodles

I feel the meal-replacement feature simply doesn't work for me. I get hungry faster than other ppl

consider mixing one scoop MRP + one scoop of whey + teaspoon of chia
:) cheaper than MRP alone
:) precise calorie budgeting and tracking
:) more filling
:( 2 open bottles
--new blog: drinks on flight
red wine + coke ? optional. No more than half a cup please, due to calorie
tomato juice
tea
All other drinks (including skim milk) has too many calories yet unsatisfying

better find out calorie content of wines for my next flights

--mvea + platform features for body-building
* multiple partial fills
* all order types
* index and known basket orders
* all strategies
* restates
* busts
* throttle control for large or basket orders
* avg pricing match to benchmark
* auto hedging
* global limit check
* agg unit limit check

--git blogging: prefer many short paragraphs to ease git-diff

--After we leave SG
need to register to vote as SG citizens. It is an obligation
--It takes huge efforts to extract a few hours of coding drill, harder than oil sand extraction. I would want to pay extra (train ticket.. prepaid SIM card for google search...) to increase the extraction rate

--productivity concept
reading, assimilating, blogging about parenting, wellness, marriage .... can have direct, tangible benefits if put into practice. I wrote many posts on these topics. The act of writing feels productive though roti is zero

--unbroken
* reunions 
* boy's Chinese reading / renzi
* my health on long flights

--I used to feel zbs will make me a great contributor to any system, but now I realize localSys is more important.

In Citi muni, I wanted to use remote debugging to understand how the localsys worked, but even the best tool was only helping me in the battle between my brain power and the cummulative brain power sunk in

--d-resort review (low value ... avoid Oth)
:) as planned, did some stretching and coding drill
:) as planned, boy did lots of math 
:) two beach stroll + cycling
