--XR and I both tend to be keenly aware of inadequacies about self and our kids. Inferiority?

I feel even if a kid is less brainy than average in class, he/she can still be adequate i.e. good enough.

家长对孩子评估下调, 孩子能感觉到. 不是滋味.　因此，有人提醒我, 对学习成绩的批评务必讲到两方面 --  1) 指出哪里下功夫可以提高, 2) 指出他过去努力的结果, 证明他具备足够的天分，只要努力就能改变现状. 

9月这次父子的接触中， 我做得不够好。 我对他强调的是他有一些聪明才智，但上进心不够，努力不够， 不求甚解，缺乏克服困难的决心。

出乎我的预料， 才见面几天我对他喊了 3 次了，都是针对他学习数学应用题的态度。
以前批评奶奶缺乏温柔的坚持。 我也急需温柔的坚持。
