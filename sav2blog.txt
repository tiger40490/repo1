--2013 ideas on retirement
Disclaimer -- I'm not seriously retirement-planning. Just random thoughts. The [1][2].. items are my retirement ideas.

I feel many people rely on their home as retirement, but you can't easily get cash out of the house. So it doesn't really generate cash needed in retirement.  It's rather important to ensure the home can be rented out to generate supplementary income [1].The better the location, the more likely. It would be idea if you can get a 2nd, perhaps small home to rent out. 

Another common thing people do is full time investing (gambling). I'm not sure at all. I'd rather leave my money with the professional fund managers. I'm more in favour of high-dividend investments.

If I have the time and good health, and needs money, I'm more in favour of working into old age[2]. Some professions are easier to find work - such as hourly work. Teaching is one field to offer work into old age.

Medical insurance [3] is quite important, esp. for catastrophic, or chronic.

Annuity [4] is a relevant option to me.

--retire in rented home
My mom suggested selling her home and live in rented home. She sees a few advantages chiefly sunshine.

--boy is influenced by classmates, so he needs a better school.
better stay rented so we can move easily

--new blog -- polyclinic xp: elderly healthcare
I spent quite a bit of time on my multiple polyclinic trips and there's an unexpected ROTI. 

For whatever reasons, the patients at TPY polyclinic are mostly elderly. Semiconsciously I started to see myself in them, and recognized, at a physical and emotional level, the SG advantage over U.S. system, where ordinary (mid-curve) old folks get significantly less help than the wealthy old folks able to afford private healthcare. U.S. healthcare wellfare targets the low-income tail of the bell curve. As the U.S. debates how to make healthcare more affordable, Singapore is quietly adapting and modernizing an already proven formula of efficient yet affordable healthycare for ordinary old folks, not only the needy. 

The Singapore system is largely based on polyclinics and subsidies at public hospitals + private clinics.

Efficient yet affordable -- fast, modern, well-staffed. system is less complicated, more understood.

Conclusion at the personal level -- My recent polyclinic experiences help foster a growing self-reassure that as long as we maintain our Singapore citizenship, we don't need to earmark a huge sum for our elderly medical needs. Until recently, I used mostly private clinics, which are still a fraction of the cost in U.S. 

I would guess very few governments take care of their ordinary old citizens so well.

Q: In 20Y when I grow old will the SG system deteriorate?
A: I have reason to believe it won't.

I now feel the elderly medical cost + daily living is rather affordable despite SG's reputation, but this is a feeling not really based on facts
--sg vs u.s.
lower labor cost in most jobs 
higher efficiency not only in government
much less driving required
much cheaper medical cost

--After we leave SG
need to register to vote as SG citizens. It is an obligation

--possibly a new blog post, but fairly vague and dubious 
I have achieved my current comfortable economic position by
* body-building with in-demand tech skills
* education which underlies the other success factors
* high saving rate based on very low burn rate
* home-made investment analysis and mgmt

by "Comfortable" I don't mean above my peers. I mean easy affordable lifestyle without the modern day pressure to work hard and make a living.

--add to blog on whey
if no temptation, i think one "MRP meal" can last 4 hours. With teptation, it is 20 minutes!

I took 2 level scoops after 8pm 1 Feb. I felt slightly hungry within an hour but didn't eat anything substantial until 10.30pm when wife offered me the left-over noodles

consider mixing one scoop MRP + one scoop of whey + teaspoon of chia
:) cheaper than MRP alone
:) precise calorie budgeting and tracking
:) more filling

--portable digital piano
Casio PX160. Given 88 keys, this is the lightest model I know. Can remove the stand and further reduce the weight.

My pet peeve for digital pianos is the finger touch. Looks like all the models (I only tried those below $2k) are equally bad, but better than those toy models.

--having more time + facilities for reflective blogging is a major benefit I'm willing to pay for.
It's a form of "wellbeing" for me, similar to having grandpa (or a friend) to listen to me

--popular vs lesser-known financial products
for liquid assets like aapl or eurusd, we can say any information is quickly disseminated so the market price is probably fair. 
for properties in popular (highly liquid but often overpriced) locations, each unit probably receives a fair amount of scrutiny, so deep discount is often due to negative factors.
For bayonne or Cambodia, for each unit the number of serious investors is probably very very low, so bargains are more likely. The amount of unassimilated information is very high, since each investor must wade through lots of raw data and ask many questions.

--sg condo: everythig extreme, not for a small budget investor like me
lease -- mostly targetting foreigners, but what if they stop coming? what if they realize hdb are cheaper? There are more and more condos in Singapore but foreigners can't keep growing IMHO

rental yield is inferior at downtown, high-end locations, superior in outskirt locations close to MRT.

I believe 2-br units are more in demand as sg is very attractive for executives with family

in a down turn, I guess the less attractive rental properties may get a hit, such as remote locations or studios

SG condo investors mostly looking for appreciation, but I'm more interested in rental income, not a strong feature of sg condos

12% tax on buyers of 2nd home... way too high. That's why some sell their hdb but I can't do that.

6-person/unit including babies? I guess strict enforcement is hard

--It takes huge efforts to extract a few hours of coding drill, harder than oil sand extraction. I would want to pay extra (train ticket.. prepaid SIM card for google search...) to increase the extraction rate

Q: On flight or MRT, in hind sight would I feel regretful to study/blog or to engage with boy?
A: if boy opens up then it's worth it. After some amount of engagement, we hit diminishing return

reading, assimilating, blogging about parenting, wellness, marriage .... can have direct, tangible benefits if put into practice. I wrote many posts on these topics. The act of writing feels productive though roti is zero

--I used to feel zbs will make me a great contributor to any system, but now I realize localSys is more important.

In Citi muni, I wanted to use remote debugging to understand how the localsys worked, but even the best tool was only helping me in the battle between my brain power and the cummulative brain power sunk in

--I used to think ascii format is inefficient and amaterish for config files. That's nothing but speculation based on Windows convention (windows *.ini files is unconventional). In the Unix and internet convention all config files are ascii.
