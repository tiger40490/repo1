--new or update:
strategic orgro is elusive. I can only think of c++ (lots of IV, but not increasing my salary...) and python
I think every other tsn attampt has some "buts". Does it mean we should stop trying? No. If I had stayed within java/sql/perl then I would have been worse off.... fewer job opportunities,  less broadended techncial base

my tsn ambition/dream is largely constrained by risks:
* stigma/respect
* figure things out faster than colleagues

For these specific risks, my current risk tolerance is higher so I ought to be bolder.

Note these risks exist with/out tsn. If want to minimize these risks we need to find a low-calibre team like RTS, or OC (95G?)

sometimes I want more time blogging than chatting with gp!
--new blogpost: 45-min commute when living with/out family
After my son was born in NY, my 50-minute commute (Hamilton) vs 35-min commute (Newport) felt very differnt
1-hr commute feels OK at mvea because ... no family and low workload
living with family, i predict i would again feel a big difference of 15 min change in commute
Many people feel such a prediction is highly unreliable, but I feel past experience is very reliable

staying with family, I get basically no time for study and very limited time for blogging.. about 5hr/week but I need 20-40 hr/week
--new blogpost ..
am i too preoccupied with PIP stigma? Spending this much time is probably unproductive.

The risk is real. So long as I have no thoughts about the topic i should keep working on it?

my tech xx can't be driven completely by IV. I would end up chasing the tails in jxee...
my tech xx can't be driven completely by the elusive concept of zbs.
my tech xx can't be driven by rank promotion including GTD as promotion is likely due to multiple factors

my c# xx journey was exciting but .. In contrast, my core-java/c++ (not jxee) journey has generated superior ROTI because 
* the topics are stable and 
* I was able to stick to these career directions

However, most of the java5 features are out of fashion in interviews. How about j8 features?
--workload concerns even when peers are not faster than me
Daniel Yan cited the factor of imposed deadline by exchange
Another person cited the fire-fighting mode
CSDoctor said in some companies like Huawei, there's unhealthy culture of long hours in the office, eroding family time, but i think this is rare nowadays. 
Most stressful "high performance" teams emphasize output and intensity ("productivity" and "efficiency") ... remember Kevin. 

--new blogpost conscious food decisions@flight
This is a intriguing context -- very limited choices..
* butter spread -- I'm able to resist
* chocolate/icecream -- I never resist
* crossant -- I find it hard to resist
* creamy food (fatty) -- i find it hard to resist

Pattern -- calorie density is extreme in fat, but luckily in small amount
Pattern -- starch is alsso hard to resist
--new log success@concurrency features ] java^c++^c# 
[tags t_othRisk]
I'm biased towards java.

I feel c# concurrenncy is less impactful because most of the important concurrent systems use *nix servers not windows, and most concurrent programming jobs do not go to windows developers

Outside windows, c++ concurrency is mostly based on the C library pthreads, non-OO and clumbsy.

The c++11 thread classes are the next generation but not widely used.

Java concurrency support is the most successful, well-designed from the beginning and extremely stable. It's simpler than c++11 thread classes. More than half the java interviews would ask threading, because java threading is understandable by the average programmer.
--overloaded .. which one to lg?
diet without zsms? challenging .. spend more on fancy, convenient foods

how do I manage this risk?
Always git commit before closing file
make backup copies
--update blogpost: research .. why is rice pudding so delicious but moderate calorie? 
Is it due to low fat, relatively low sugar and high water content?

"alt-shift -- changes input language as the windows standard"
--since 2007, very few examples of "effort->ROTI" including financial ROTI
(vague, not worth publishing)
* c++/C#/java IV pass rate
* pure algo IV pass rate
* online timed coding IV pass rate
* passive income growing including Energy12
* diet

:) as planned, did some stretching and coding drill
:) as planned, boy did lots of math 
:) as planned, wild wild wet + buffet but overeating to be badly bloated

i didn't celebrate/reward myself enough esp. for the stretching and coding drill

--healthy diet tips given by SG HPB #orange
recommended -- sugar substitutes; sugar-free drinks; Chinese tea
orange is safe even though not leanest. Orange is not as low-cal as some veg but Singapore HPB (and many experts would agree) picked orange as the safest food.

a food with 0g fat or 0% DV of fat still has fat if calories from fat is nonzero
