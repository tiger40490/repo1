--healthy diet tips given by SG HPB #orange
#1 tip -- reduce animal fat
recommended -- sugar substitutes; sugar-free drinks; Chinese tea
orange is safe even though not leanest. Orange is not as low-cal as some veg but Singapore HPB (and many experts would agree) picked orange as the safest food. Much safer than most foods we eat during a festive season. I would say the same about the MRP.

--new blog (vague):
bitter setbacks since mid 2012 as I look back in 2019:
* MSFM poor ROI. See tabulation
* long service, moving-up attempts failed 3 times in SG. Self-esteem damaged each time
** Next time I get into a perm job, I will not try so hard
* c++ visible progress is slow; c# visible progress yes but abandoned
* FSM and trading as a side project and new direction? didn't realy bear fruits 

Now I feel failed attempts are part of life for everyone of us unless you don't make any attempt. It's irresponsible to avoid reviewing those unsuccessful attempts, but let's not be too fixated on the negatives. 

It is more useful and motivating to spot and perceive the positives -- progress, breakthrough, unexpected longevity... 

Below I use the number of stars to denote the difficulty level + significance of each positive:
** Beijing and khm properties
** boy did OK in P4 major exam -- science and Eng esp. strong performance
** boy sticking to piano and swimming
* meimei showing absorbency
* kids' Chinese showing big progress
** my wellness maintained, and even improved slightly
* 2018 weight and diet improvement
* reunions are satisfying
*** 2015-2018 c++ breakthrough (including technical wins) in the body-building contest
* java body-building contest -- I remain confident
** coding drill -- visible and invisible progresses

--since 2007, very few examples of "effort->ROTI" including financial ROTI
(vague, not worth publishing)
* c++/C#/java IV pass rate
* pure algo IV pass rate
* passive income growing including Energy12
* diet

:) as planned, did some stretching and coding drill
:) as planned, boy did lots of math 
:) as planned, wild wild wet + buffet but overeating to be badly bloated

--new blog: I will prefer tropical retirement cities
grandparents and many U.S. retires prefer warm.
My wife hates cold weather.
As I get older, I too prefer warmer cities like SG.
--I booked Mar2019 trip quickly because I'm now less fixated on cash flow and I value family time more highly
This could be a good start of a progressive change.
