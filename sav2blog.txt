coding drill
c++ books from Josh if coding drill wears out
optionally magazine + newspaper? did some

--new blog: CNY trip diet reviewing
In terms of weight (and probably calorie) ... not so effective. I would guess my weight (in Retro) would be 64kg so I plan to bring it down gradually back to 63 and 62.5 kg
In terms of nutrition ... high quliaty
In terms of self-control and daily battles? won some lost some
:) rice at home
:) stayed away from peanuts + love letters + cakeHistory 
:( cakes -- offce free food

biggest enemy remains temptations (+ the ensuing loss of control), in the form of cakes, ice cream, but not peanuts!

starch reduction? successful. 
* completely free of rice-dependency. 
* Very few fancy breads.
* all the meals were basically without staple starch food
* had some rice + buns on flight

cakes + cookies? indulgence on two buffets + MS office free food + pineapple tarts but luckily I mixed with raw veg, big improvement. I didn't touch the garlic peanuts + love letters. 

home cooking? basically healthy though not low-cal. I avoided starch and fat, but still high cal intake

snacking? cake indulgence is not so good, but most other snacks are whole some
* raw veg made by GM
* yogurt
* fruits
* mongo ice cream

veg (raw or cooked) + fruits? highly successful
ice cream, fried stuff? successful
lean protein? success. Lots of fish and lean meat
nuts? small indulgence at Aerotel
whole milk and yogurt? successful. No loss of control

Q: eating more healthy food ... hoping to suppress appetite for the heavy stuff  -- is it effective?
I did that in two steamboat dinners ...

--update blog on yogurt
satisfying? Not really, but in the CNY context it is a low-calorie food

--polyclinic takeaway
* from U.S. make ttsh appt for Mar
* all the liver tests? no issue 
* yellow? probbly due to carrot, after reviewing all the tests
* carrot continue? OK
* drive towards 60kg? Doc said OK. I would say go all-out
* even 57kg is safe for me? No comment
* I believe 69 kg would be the upper limit of my green zone
* lower end of bmi green zone doesn't imply low cholesterol

--healthy diet tips given by SG HPB
#1 tip -- reduce animal fat
cakes and bbq meat -- portion control
recommended -- steaming, boiling, roasting
recommended -- sugar substitues; sugarfree drinks; chinese tea
orange is safe even though not leanest. Orange is not as low-cal as some veg but Singapore HPB (and many experts would agree) picked orange as the safest food. Much safer than most foods we eat during a festive season. I would say the same about the MRP.

--After we leave SG
need to register to vote as SG citizens. It is an obligation

--add to blog on whey
if no temptation, i think one "MRP meal" can last 4 hours. With teptation, it is 20 minutes!

I took 2 level scoops after 8pm 1 Feb. I felt slightly hungry within an hour but didn't eat anything substantial until 10.30pm when wife offered me the left-over noodles

consider mixing one scoop MRP + one scoop of whey + teaspoon of chia
:) cheaper than MRP alone
:) precise calorie budgeting and tracking
:) more filling

--git blogging: prefer many short paragraphs to ease git-diff

--taxi fare to airport
grab is demand-supply driven. For metered taxi,
up to $20 but midnight has surcharge + booking fee, so I ended up paying $36

--It takes huge efforts to extract a few hours of coding drill, harder than oil sand extraction. I would want to pay extra (train ticket.. prepaid SIM card for google search...) to increase the extraction rate

--productivity concept
reading, assimilating, blogging about parenting, wellness, marriage .... can have direct, tangible benefits if put into practice. I wrote many posts on these topics. The act of writing feels productive though roti is zero

====unbroken
* reunions 
* boy's Chinese reading / renzi
* my health on long flights
* my swim/jogging/chin-up
* the $40 bike
* iview laptop didn't fail as feared

--I used to feel zbs will make me a great contributor to any system, but now I realize localSys is more important.

In Citi muni, I wanted to use remote debugging to understand how the localsys worked, but even the best tool was only helping me in the battle between my brain power and the cummulative brain power sunk in

--I used to think ascii format is inefficient and amaterish for config files. That's nothing but speculation based on Windows convention (windows *.ini files is unconventional). In the Unix and internet convention all config files are ascii.
