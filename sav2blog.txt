--XR and I both tend to be keenly aware of inadequacies/limitations/weaknesses in self and our kids. Inferiority?

Rationally, even if a kid is less brainy than average in class, he/she can still be adequate i.e. good enough.

--to select a few words on touch screen:
thumb-swipe slowly over them

--flood zone:
south-west tip of the peninsula + a few locations with insufficient drainage

not really any discount for flooding history, according to an agent. I guess it's supply and demand

--price level near the Hudson county park? SFH around 500k perhaps. I don't mind a 500k price since it would appreciate

I would buy or rent between the park n light rail line, hopefully close to either 34th or 45th station.

I may also rent an address close to the top school

--I feel clean streets usually have big houses (... because the affluent like both.) but I need to find a smaller home in a relatively clean stree, better than Juliette

--price spread due to location? Not much diff between uptown and south Bayonne

Indicative numbers from Donna: 
sfh 400k +/-
2fh in good condition 500k+ -- viable choice for me long term
from me:
small condo: 300k

Some units have a basement with separate entrance -- could rent out as a unit if with kitchen/bath

--Now is seller's market so some people bid 7% above the asking to snatch up a unit. These aggressive buyers need good knowledge about the location

--wood houses built in the 1920's have better quality and can last longer, even if they need interior rennovation

--many new rental apartments but no new houses

--improvement (like new kitchen) to a house leads to faster appreciation than on a condo
#1 advantage of condo is price tag
