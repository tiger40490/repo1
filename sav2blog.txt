--new blog: I will prefer tropical retirement cities
grandparents and many U.S. retires prefer warm.
My wife hates cold weather.
As I get older, I too prefer warmer cities like SG.
--I booked Mar2019 trip quickly because I'm now less fixated on cash flow and I value family time more highly

--oth! no mean achievements this long weekend
very healthy diet in office !
sent SQL questions to friends
provided a listening year to XR
no movie no leisure browsing
measurable progress on div stock. Worked out how to limit due diligence tcost
controlled binge at Chinatown
worked through my proposal to Jay and proposal to Ashish
worked through my timing decision when to leave this comfortable job
moving home... stressful but no l@ctrl binge
worked out visio + EMC 
thorough clean-up of fridge, microwave and kitchen top 

... now the obvious
[[OS by Willam Stallings]]
push-ups + stretching

... 3+1 priorities: (zero on localsys)
SG hibernation + body-building -- major progress, esp. at high level including timing
wellness -- well done
income generator -- controlled research, action and soul-search

--since 2007, very few examples of "effort->ROTI" including financial ROTI
* c++/C#/java IV pass rate
* pure algo IV pass rate
* passive income growing including Energy12
* diet

--where to put the reminder below? Put in on google calendar once a day
"alt-shift -- changes input language as the windows standard"

--healthy diet tips given by SG HPB #orange
#1 tip -- reduce animal fat
cakes and bbq meat -- portion control
recommended -- steaming, boiling, roasting
recommended -- sugar substitutes; sugar-free drinks; Chinese tea
orange is safe even though not leanest. Orange is not as low-cal as some veg but Singapore HPB (and many experts would agree) picked orange as the safest food. Much safer than most foods we eat during a festive season. I would say the same about the MRP.

--new blog: [19]liv`%%dream life right now
These are elements of the dream life I envisioned 5..20 years ago:

beautiful kids + wife. Healthy grandparents. Stable family
health -- bmi, sleep, appetite, dental ..
fin: concrete, spacious, well-located home paid off
fin: debt free
fin: reliable passive incomes on appreciating asset
attractive, convincing trec
robust career prospect, arguably even higher than the FTE

--new blog (vague):
bitter setbacks since mid 2012 as I look back in 2019:
* MSFM poor ROI. See tabulation
* long service, moving-up attempts failed 3 times in SG. Self-esteem damaged each time
* c++ visible progress is slow; c# visible progress yes but abandoned
* FSM and trading as a side project and new direction? didn't realy bear fruits 

Now I feel failed attempts are part of life for everyone of us unless you don't make any attempt. It's irresponsible to avoid reviewing those unsuccessful attempts, but let's not be too fixated on the negatives. 

It is more useful and motivating to spot and perceive the positives -- progress, breakthrough, unexpected longevity... 

Below I use the number of stars to denote the difficulty level + significance of each positive:
** Beijing and khm properties
** boy did OK in P4 major exam -- science and Eng esp. strong performance
** boy sticking to piano and swimming
* meimei showing absorbency
* kids' Chinese showing big progress
** my wellness maintained, and even improved slightly
* 2018 weight and diet improvement
* reunions are satisfying
*** 2015-2018 c++ breakthrough (including technical wins) in the body-building contest
* java body-building contest -- I remain confident
** coding drill -- visible and invisible progresses

--polyclinic takeaway
* drive towards 60kg? Doc said OK. I would say go all-out
* even 57kg is safe for me? No comment
* I believe 69 kg would be the upper limit of my green zone
* lower end of bmi green zone doesn't imply low cholesterol

--add to blog on whey
if no temptation, i think one "MRP meal" can last 4 hours. With teptation, it is 20 minutes!

I took 2 level scoops after 8pm 1 Feb. I felt slightly hungry within an hour but didn't eat anything substantial until 10.30pm when wife offered me the left-over noodles

I feel the meal-replacement feature simply doesn't work for me. I get hungry faster than other ppl

consider mixing one scoop MRP + one scoop of whey + teaspoon of chia
:) cheaper than MRP alone
:) precise calorie budgeting and tracking
:) more filling
:( 2 open bottles
--new blog: drinks on flight
red wine + coke ? optional. No more than half a cup please, due to calorie
tomato juice
tea
All other drinks (including skim milk) has too many calories yet unsatisfying

better find out calorie content of wines for my next flights

--mvea + platform features for body-building
* multiple partial fills
* all order types
* index and known basket orders
* all strategies
* restates
* busts
* throttle control for large or basket orders
* avg pricing match to benchmark
* auto hedging
* global limit check
* agg unit limit check

--unbroken
* reunions 
* boy's Chinese reading / renzi
* my health on long flights
* my swim/jogging/chin-up
* the $40 bike
* iview laptop didn't fail as feared

--unbroken (keep in 0.txt, later in twister)
cholesterol
fitness
wife's competence

--d-resort review (low value ... avoid Oth)
:) as planned, did some stretching and coding drill
:) as planned, boy did lots of math 
:) as planned, wild wild wet + buffet but overeating to be badly bloated
