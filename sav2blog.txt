I'm likely to be still in U.S.

--sg vs u.s.
lower labor cost in most jobs 
higher efficiency not only in government
much less driving required
much cheaper medical cost

--having more time + facilities for reflective blogging is a major benefit I'm willing to pay for.
It's a form of "wellbeing" for me, similar to having grandpa (or a friend) to listen to me

--popular vs lesser-known financial products
for liquid assets like aapl or eurusd, we can say any information is quickly disseminated so the market price is probably fair. 
for properties in popular (highly liquid but often overpriced) locations, each unit probably receives a fair amount of scrutiny, so deep discount is often due to negative factors.
For bayonne or Cambodia, for each unit the number of serious investors is probably very very low, so bargains are more likely. The amount of unassimilated information is very high, since each investor must wade through lots of raw data and ask many questions.

--sg condo: everythig extreme, not for a small budget investor like me
lease -- mostly targetting foreigners, but what if they stop coming? what if they realize hdb are cheaper? There are more and more condos in Singapore but foreigners can't keep growing IMHO

rental yield is inferior at downtown, high-end locations, superior in outskirt locations close to MRT.

vacancy? If location is good then lower asking price will hopefully help

I believe 2-br units are more in demand as sg is very attractive for executives with family

in a down turn, I guess the less attractive rental properties may get a hit, such as remote locations or studios


SG condo investors mostly looking for appreciation, but I'm more interested in rental income. 

enbloc can happen to a 30Y-new building, driven by developer greed and exordinary exuberance.

12% tax on buyers of 2nd home... way too high. That's why some sell their hdb but I can't do that.

6-person/unit including babies? I guess strict enforcement is hard
--sg local mgmt agent
delinquent tenant? less of a problem. Can threaten to report to the authorities and damage their EP renewal, but these tenants will do their research and may be unfazed

ERA reps often sound confident, but I think it's not so hassle-free

--It takes huge efforts to extract a few hours of coding drill, harder than oil sand extraction. I would want to pay extra (train ticket.. prepaid SIM card for google search...) to increase the extraction rate

Q: On flight or MRT, in hind sight would I feel regretful to study/blog or to engage with boy?
A: if boy opens up then it's worth it. After some amount of engagement, we hit diminishing return

reading, assimilating, blogging about parenting, wellness, marriage .... can have direct, tangible benefits if put into practice. I wrote many posts on these topics. The act of writing feels productive though roti is zero

--I used to feel zbs will make me a great contributor to any system, but now I realize localSys is more important.

In Citi muni, I wanted to use remote debugging to understand how the localsys worked, but even the best tool was only helping me in the battle between my brain power and the cummulative brain power sunk in

--I used to think ascii format is inefficient and amaterish for config files. That's nothing but speculation based on Windows convention (windows *.ini files is unconventional). In the Unix and internet convention all config files are ascii.
