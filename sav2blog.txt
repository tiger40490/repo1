--new blog (not ready for publishing): criticalMass against churn 
See also post on impact of c++jobs

[tags t_gz_j^cpp, domainBet]

Critical mass (eg: in core java self-study) is one of the most effective strategies against technology churn. Once I accumulated the critical mass, I don't need a full time job to sustain it.

Q: how strongly is it related to accumulation?
A: not much. you need to accumulate the critical mass. With java I did it through enough interviews and reading. 

Q: why some domains offer no critical mass?
A: some (jxee) have limited depth
A: some (py) have No pattern identified from interview questions

Q: how strongly is it related to leverage?
A: not much. Critical mass enhances leverage

..other examples of criticl mass against churn
SQL? yes though SQL is diminishing
c++? yes took much longer to reach criticl mass
socket? not yet

--since 2007, very few examples of "effort->ROTI" including financial ROTI
(vague, not worth publishing)
* c++/C#/java IV pass rate
* pure algo IV pass rate
* online timed coding IV pass rate
* passive income growing including Energy12
* diet

--d-resort review (low value ... avoid Oth)
:) as planned, did some stretching and coding drill
:) as planned, boy did lots of math 
:) as planned, wild wild wet + buffet but overeating to be badly bloated

i didn't celebrate/reward myself enough esp. for the stretching and coding drill

--healthy diet tips given by SG HPB #orange
recommended -- sugar substitutes; sugar-free drinks; Chinese tea
orange is safe even though not leanest. Orange is not as low-cal as some veg but Singapore HPB (and many experts would agree) picked orange as the safest food.
