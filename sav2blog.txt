When I first identify an acquaintance as an all-round high flyer, his (her) "note-worthy" achievements were invariablly rather few, thanks to my automatic filter on his other "successes" ... becasue those "successes" are, at a deep and personal level, unimportant to me. But then those things insidiously sneak past my defence into my inferiority complex and /infest/. Extremely irrational and 不值得. 

I would rather feel inferior to someone I know well and have many real note-worthy achievements. I doubt there's any in my circle.

Incidentally, when a public speaker is introduced on the stage, the audience often hear a list of "successes" which are mostly unimportant to me.

(Even though none of them is a friend I know well enough) Over the years there were a small number of acquaintances [1] I have singled out. Once I singe one out, I tend to lose my critical thinking and see many unimportant/insignificant/secondary "achievements" as enviable.  Critical thinking is badly, badly needed at such a juncture!

Incidentally, one of the most effective ways to feel not-inferior is a lucrative job offer, even if I don't take it.

The initial "enviable achievements" are usually one these 5
1) income, almost always managerial [2]
2) investment, mostly property
3) beautiful wife
* fitness, flexibility and body shape
* short commute

The other factors are usually (as they should) in my "don't-care/unimportant-to-me" list, but they sneak into my inferiority complex.

* (multiple) degreed from prestigous universities? Actually most of them are inferior to me!
* academic kids
* competitions and awards to himself or kids
* branded employers? many of them have fewer than mine
* running his own side business? I did while many of them didn't
* wife professional career
* work-life balance... "easy job"? Questionable. Most high-paying jobs require effort 
* writing and music skills? I achieved more than most of them!
* publications
* cars? is a liability not an asset!
* green card
* vacations to many places? Huge cost, no real gain for me
* magerial success at an erly age
* golf skills? i couldn't care less when I'm not losing my critical thinking.
* networking skill, smooth personality? I'm not this type

[2] as soon as I hear the MD title of some ex-classmate, I lose my critical thinking defence.

Better consider [[compassion and self hate]] and Buddhist teaching

[1] Beside ML, Here are some questionable names. Many of them I barely know the name and job title, so my infeority is fundamentally similar to my infatuation over the Indonesiian girl Sandy, whom I spoke to fewer than 3 times.
* Lu Nuo -- I only know he has a writing hobby ...
* Cai Hongyu
* Tao YY -- I don't really know how he is doing
* Yang Yang
* Xie Xiaoli

--XR and I both tend to be keenly aware of inadequacies about self and our kids. Inferiority?

I feel even if a kid is less brainy than average in class, he/she can still be adequate i.e. good enough.

--add to blog on absorbency:
I frequently (once a month?) question my endeavor (and the ellusie strategic value) .. detrimental to absorbency. It's already hard to absorb the practice even without these self-doubts.
* yoga
* risk analytics
* socket

* how much technical learning you get on a 15H long flight is a measure of your absorbency.

* Rahul, me and Abhinav find joy in coding drill but many of my friends seem to focus on reading the ideas rather than practicing and solving problems independently. The joy increases your absorbency

--'super' -- java keyword
A super of K (a type or object) is a smaller thing than K. "baseof" would be a better keyword.
