--update blog (oth)
leverage concept of my own, inspired by the book
very similar to ROTI but more long-term
c# study? high leverage thanks to the initial gradient
c# offered some xref xx
yoga? questionable leverage .. not much visible progress

--overloaded .. which one to lg?
diet without zsms? challenging .. spend more on fancy, convenient foods
lgpp crocs shopping 
indeed push to next week like Thu evening

--0 byte left .. very dangerous
how do I manage this risk?
Always git commit before closing file
make backup copies

--yoga
how to be less hard pushing?
how to reward myself more?

--new blog: python metaprogramming features
feature: module import
feature: runtime code generation and introspection

These are two of the most powerful py features. I wrote in another blog that py reflection is richer than c# and much richer than java

feature: decorator layering and with param
feature: metaclasses. IBM has an article

What's in common among these features? We manipulate modules, classes and attributes as if they are ordinary data. In other words, we manipulate the program itself. That's hallmark of metaprogramming IMHO. We can check other people's idea of "metaproamming" but I don't have to follow theirs.

--since 2007, very few examples of "effort->ROTI" including financial ROTI
(vague, not worth publishing)
* c++/C#/java IV pass rate
* pure algo IV pass rate
* online timed coding IV pass rate
* passive income growing including Energy12
* diet

--d-resort review (low value ... avoid Oth)
:) as planned, did some stretching and coding drill
:) as planned, boy did lots of math 
:) as planned, wild wild wet + buffet but overeating to be badly bloated

i didn't celebrate/reward myself enough esp. for the stretching and coding drill

--healthy diet tips given by SG HPB #orange
recommended -- sugar substitutes; sugar-free drinks; Chinese tea
orange is safe even though not leanest. Orange is not as low-cal as some veg but Singapore HPB (and many experts would agree) picked orange as the safest food.

a food with 0g fat or 0% DV of fat still has fat if calories from fat is nonzero
