When I first identify an acquaintance as an all-round high flyer, his (her) "note-worthy" achievements were invariablly rather few, thanks to my automatic filter on his other "successes" ... becasue those "successes" are, at a deep and personal level, unimportant to me. But then those things insidiously sneak past my defence into my inferiority complex and /infest/. Extremely irrational and 不值得. 

I would rather feel inferior to someone I know well and have many real note-worthy achievements. I doubt there's any in my circle.

Incidentally, when a public speaker is introduced on the stage, the audience often hear a list of "successes" which are mostly unimportant to me.

(Even though none of them is a friend I know well enough) Over the years there were a small number of acquaintances [1] I have singled out. Once I singe one out, I tend to lose my critical thinking and see many unimportant/insignificant/secondary "achievements" as enviable.  Critical thinking is badly, badly needed at such a juncture!

Incidentally, one of the most effective ways to feel not-inferior is a lucrative job offer, even if I don't take it.

The initial "enviable achievements" are usually one these 5
1) income, almost always managerial [2]
2) investment, mostly property
3) beautiful wife
* fitness, flexibility and body shape
* short commute

The other factors are usually (as they should) in my "don't-care/unimportant-to-me" list, but they sneak into my inferiority complex.

* (multiple) degreed from prestigous universities? Actually most of them are inferior to me!
* academic kids
* competitions and awards to himself or kids
* branded employers? many of them have fewer than mine
* running his own side business? I did while many of them didn't
* wife professional career
* work-life balance... "easy job"? Questionable. Most high-paying jobs require effort 
* writing and music skills? I achieved more than most of them!
* publications
* cars? is a liability not an asset!
* green card
* vacations to many places? Huge cost, no real gain for me
* magerial success at an erly age
* golf skills? i couldn't care less when I'm not losing my critical thinking.
* networking skill, smooth personality? I'm not this type

[2] as soon as I hear the MD title of some ex-classmate, I lose my critical thinking defence.

Better consider [[compassion and self hate]] and Buddhist teaching

[1] Beside ML, Here are some questionable names. Many of them I barely know the name and job title, so my infeority is fundamentally similar to my infatuation over the Indonesiian girl Sandy, whom I spoke to fewer than 3 times.
* Lu Nuo -- I only know he has a writing hobby ...
* Cai Hongyu
* Tao YY -- I don't really know how he is doing
* Yang Yang
* Xie Xiaoli

--XR and I both tend to be keenly aware of inadequacies about self and our kids. Inferiority?

I feel even if a kid is less brainy than average in class, he/she can still be adequate i.e. good enough.

:) seats good. I saw some families sleeping on those.
:( the usual noise level. There might be a few relatively quiet yet fairly safe corners
lounges? no lie-down place
--Leetcode "hard" Q124
Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

Simple solution -- DFT. Along each root-to-leaf nde, use the max-subarray algo and store 'maxSumEningHere' in each node. I feel this is the most efficient solution there is.

--leetcode hard problem 239
Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position, return the max item in it... constant time.

Note each item lives a fixed number of cycles. so insert/delete are both constrained.

Compare the min-stack. This is a min-queue!

use a regular queue + a sorted stack?

Compare skyline problem.

sorted linked list with hm pointing to it for O(1) deletion. For insert, i'm thinking of binary heap again.

can we use the sum?

fixed capacity binary heap -- is insertion faster than O(logN)?
