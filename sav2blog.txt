keep interviewing: y rare]%%peers
Many of my peers acknowledge the importance of job interivews, but they are able to move up so they don't need to interview again and again.

Their model doesn't work for consultants.

Their model doesn't woork for non-leaders.

Their model is risky when they need to move out.

--new blog (not ready for publishing): criticalMass against churn 
See also post on impact of c++jobs

[tags t_gz_j^cpp, t_domainBet]

Critical mass (eg: in core java self-study) is one of the most effective strategies against technology churn. Once I accumulated the critical mass, I don't need a full time job to sustain it.

Q: how strongly is it related to accumulation?
A: not much AFTER you accumulate the critical mass. With java I did it through enough interviews and reading. 

Q: why some domains offer no critical mass?
A: some (jxee) have limited depth
A: some (TMP, py) have No pattern identified from interview questions

Q: how strongly is it related to leverage?
A: not much though Critical mass enhances leverage

..other examples of criticl mass against churn:
SQL? yes though SQL is diminishing
classic data structures? Yes
c++? yes took much longer to reach criticl mass
STL? yes
socket? not yet

--overloaded .. which one to lg?
diet without zsms? challenging .. spend more on fancy, convenient foods
lgpp crocs shopping 
indeed push to next week like Thu evening

--0 byte left .. very dangerous
how do I manage this risk?
Always git commit before closing file
make backup copies

--yoga
how to be less hard pushing?
how to reward myself more?

--since 2007, very few examples of "effort->ROTI" including financial ROTI
(vague, not worth publishing)
* c++/C#/java IV pass rate
* pure algo IV pass rate
* online timed coding IV pass rate
* passive income growing including Energy12
* diet

:) as planned, did some stretching and coding drill
:) as planned, boy did lots of math

i didn't celebrate/reward myself enough esp. for the stretching and coding drill

--healthy diet tips given by SG HPB #orange
recommended -- sugar substitutes; sugar-free drinks; Chinese tea
orange is safe even though not leanest. Orange is not as low-cal as some veg but Singapore HPB (and many experts would agree) picked orange as the safest food.
