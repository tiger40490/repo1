--Q: most valuable items I can bring to NY:

--Q: eating more healthy food ... hoping to suppress appetite for the heavy stuff  -- is it effective?
I did that in two steamboat dinners ...

--new blog: bridge floss
sensitivity in lower left middle tooth -- the gap between 2 bonding points is too small to reach

--new post: orange is safe even though not leanest #CNY
Orange is not as low-cal as some veg but Singapore HPB (and many experts would agree) picked orange as the safest food. Much safer than most foods we eat during a festive season.

I would say the same about the MRP.

--update blog on yogurt
satisfying? Not really, but in the CNY context it is a low-calorie food

--new blog: more time+facilities4reflective blogging 
.. is a major benefit I'm willing to pay for.

It's a form of "wellbeing" for me, similar to having grandpa (or a friend) to listen to me

--polyclinic takeaway
* from U.S. make ttsh appt for Mar
* all the liver tests? no issue 
* yellow? probbly due to carrot, after reviewing all the tests
* carrot continue? OK
* drive towards 60kg? Doc said OK. I would say go all-out
* even 57kg is safe for me? No comment
* I believe 69 kg would be the upper limit of my green zone
* lower end of bmi green zone doesn't imply low cholesterol

--add to blog on staying rented
boy is influenced by classmates, so he needs a better school.
better stay rented so we can move easily

--After we leave SG
need to register to vote as SG citizens. It is an obligation

--add to blog on whey
if no temptation, i think one "MRP meal" can last 4 hours. With teptation, it is 20 minutes!

I took 2 level scoops after 8pm 1 Feb. I felt slightly hungry within an hour but didn't eat anything substantial until 10.30pm when wife offered me the left-over noodles

consider mixing one scoop MRP + one scoop of whey + teaspoon of chia
:) cheaper than MRP alone
:) precise calorie budgeting and tracking
:) more filling

--portable digital piano
Casio PX160. Given 88 keys, this is the lightest model I know. Can remove the stand and further reduce the weight.

My pet peeve for digital pianos is the finger touch. Looks like all the models (I only tried those below $2k) are equally bad, but better than those toy models.

--git blogging: prefer many short paragraphs to ease git-diff
 
--It takes huge efforts to extract a few hours of coding drill, harder than oil sand extraction. I would want to pay extra (train ticket.. prepaid SIM card for google search...) to increase the extraction rate

--productivity concept
Wasted human potential is more apparent in PHL than SGP

Q: On flight or MRT, in hind sight would I feel regretful to study/blog or to engage with boy?
A: if boy opens up then it's worth it. After some amount of engagement, we hit diminishing return

reading, assimilating, blogging about parenting, wellness, marriage .... can have direct, tangible benefits if put into practice. I wrote many posts on these topics. The act of writing feels productive though roti is zero

--I tend to focus on the negative examples in my relationships and take them as personal... Seriously negative and unfair perception
* XR, Nikhil turning cold but not counting Deepak, Ashish Singh, CSDoctor, HenryWu, Wenjia, Longbo, Yihai, Mithun, ...

====unbroken

* boy's Chinese reading / renzi
* my health on long flights
* my swim/jogging/chin-up
* the $40 bike
* iview laptop didn't fail as feared

--improvement (like new kitchen) to a house leads to faster appreciation than on a condo
#1 advantage of condo is price tag

--I used to feel zbs will make me a great contributor to any system, but now I realize localSys is more important.

In Citi muni, I wanted to use remote debugging to understand how the localsys worked, but even the best tool was only helping me in the battle between my brain power and the cummulative brain power sunk in

--I used to think ascii format is inefficient and amaterish for config files. That's nothing but speculation based on Windows convention (windows *.ini files is unconventional). In the Unix and internet convention all config files are ascii.
