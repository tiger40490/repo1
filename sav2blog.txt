##shallow exposures

compared to the t_skillist 

I would say few (bash, sql) of the items below offer any accu like my c++ and core java experience

JGC -- i think most guys have only textbook knowledge, no working knowledge. No accu
java latency tuning -- is an art not a science. Poor portability. JVM tuning is mostly about GC but at application level, real problem is usually I/O like datastore and serialization. Sometimes data structure and threading also matter
bash scripting -- i read books for years but only gained some traction by writing many non-trivial bash scripts
ajax -- 
spring -- I used it many times but no breakthtrough. In-depth knowledge is never quizzed
SQL -- 5 years typical experience is less than 1Y@PWM
--where to put the reminder below? Put in on google calendar once a day
"alt-shift -- changes input language as the windows standard"

--since 2007, very few examples of "effort->ROTI" including financial ROTI
(vague, not worth publishing)
* c++/C#/java IV pass rate
* pure algo IV pass rate
* online timed coding IV pass rate
* passive income growing including Energy12
* diet

--d-resort review (low value ... avoid Oth)
:) as planned, did some stretching and coding drill
:) as planned, boy did lots of math 
:) as planned, wild wild wet + buffet but overeating to be badly bloated

i didn't celebrate/reward myself enough esp. for the stretching and coding drill

--healthy diet tips given by SG HPB #orange
recommended -- sugar substitutes; sugar-free drinks; Chinese tea
orange is safe even though not leanest. Orange is not as low-cal as some veg but Singapore HPB (and many experts would agree) picked orange as the safest food.
