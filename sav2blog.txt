--I used to think ascii config files are inefficient and amaterish. That's nothing but speculation based on Windows convention, except the windows *.ini files. In the Unix convention all config files are ascii.

--It takes huge efforts to extract a few hours of coding drill, harder than oil sand extraction. I would want to pay extra (train ticket.. prepaid SIM card...) to increase the extraction rate

--long flight
The shorter segment is always much lighter strain on the body. Less severe effects of long sleep-deprivation and "confinement"-induced muscle stiffness .

It pays to reduce the duration of the long segment, so avoid HK or Guangzhou.

Only HK and BJ provide airside hourly hotel.
--striving towards 
burn not rot
#1) more coding drill 
self-discipline
minimalist lifestyle, 
minimizing dependency, 
less food, more exercise

--those oily or starchy foods (including the paste on fried chicken skin) get stored in the body so definitely not better than raw vegie/fruits

--boy agreed to jog for 9 minutes and cycle for 9 minutes. The attitude alone is commendable.
--productivity concept
Wasted human potential is more apparent in PHL than SGP

Q: On flight or MRT, in hind sight would I feel regretful to study/think or to engage with boy?
A: if boy opens up then it's worth it. After some amount of engagement we hit diminishing return

reading, assimilating, blogging about parenting, wellness, marriage .... can have direct, tangible benefits if put into practice. I wrote many posts on these topics. The act of writing feels productive though roti is zero

--腾飞 in BGC properties is less likely than in Chinese cities presumably because Chinese investors prefer first-tier metropollis like London, Toronto, Sydney etc. Mind share remains low for Manila.

--Mind museum posed the question "Which city is best for you?"
Q: u want to commute by rail, subway, or walk/cycle?
A: for me, rush hour train frequency is important, so bus and rail are not good enough

Q: how far from city center do you wan to live?
A: I used to prefer closer, but now I think 1-hour distance is acceptable given my new thinking on productivity

Q: Do you have a family or as a single?

====unbroken (mastered in 0.txt)

* reunions were satisfying, immediate and without difficulty, better than feared
* boy's weight maintained

--XR and I both tend to be too keenly aware of inadequacies/limitations/weaknesses in self and our kids. Inferiority?

Rationally, even if a kid is less brainy than average in class, he/she can still be adequate i.e. good enough.

--Now is seller's market so some people bid 7% above the asking to snatch up a unit. These aggressive buyers need good knowledge about the location

--improvement (like new kitchen) to a house leads to faster appreciation than on a condo
#1 advantage of condo is price tag

--I used to feel zbs will make me a great contributor to any system, but now I realize localSys is more important.

In Citi muni, I wanted to use remote debugging to understand how the localsys worked, but even the best tool was only helping me in the battle between my brain power and the cummulative brain power sunk in
