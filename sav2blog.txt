--new log success@concurrency features ] java^c++^c# 
[tags t_othRisk]
I'm biased towards java.

I feel c# concurrenncy is less impactful because most of the important concurrent systems use *nix servers not windows, and most concurrent programming jobs do not go to windows developers

Outside windows, c++ concurrency is mostly based on the C library pthreads, non-OO and clumbsy.

The c++11 thread classes are the next generation but not widely used.

Java concurrency support is the most successful, well-designed from the beginning and extremely stable. It's simpler than c++11 thread classes. More than half the java interviews would ask threading, because java threading is understandable by the average programmer.

my tech xx can't be driven completely by IV. I would end up chasing the tails in jxee...
my tech xx can't be driven completely by the vague concept of zbs.
my tech xx can't be driven by promotion including GTD as promotion is unlikely due to multiple factors

my c# xx journey was exciting but .. In contrast, my core-java/c++ (not jxee) journey has generated superior ROTI because 
* the topics are stable and 
* I was able to stick to these career directions

However, most of the java5 features are out of fashion in interviews. How about j8 features?

--overloaded .. which one to lg?
diet without zsms? challenging .. spend more on fancy, convenient foods
lgpp crocs shopping 
indeed push to next week like Thu evening

--0 byte left .. very dangerous
how do I manage this risk?
Always git commit before closing file
make backup copies

--yoga
how to be less hard pushing?
how to reward myself more?

--where to put the reminder below? Put in on google calendar once a day
"alt-shift -- changes input language as the windows standard"


--since 2007, very few examples of "effort->ROTI" including financial ROTI
(vague, not worth publishing)
* c++/C#/java IV pass rate
* pure algo IV pass rate
* online timed coding IV pass rate
* passive income growing including Energy12
* diet

--d-resort review (low value ... avoid Oth)
:) as planned, did some stretching and coding drill
:) as planned, boy did lots of math 
:) as planned, wild wild wet + buffet but overeating to be badly bloated

i didn't celebrate/reward myself enough esp. for the stretching and coding drill

--healthy diet tips given by SG HPB #orange
recommended -- sugar substitutes; sugar-free drinks; Chinese tea
orange is safe even though not leanest. Orange is not as low-cal as some veg but Singapore HPB (and many experts would agree) picked orange as the safest food.
