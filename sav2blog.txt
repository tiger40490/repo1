--XR and I both tend to be too keenly aware of inadequacies/limitations/weaknesses in self and our kids. Inferiority?

Rationally, even if a kid is less brainy than average in class, he/she can still be adequate i.e. good enough.

--Now is seller's market so some people bid 7% above the asking to snatch up a unit. These aggressive buyers need good knowledge about the location

--improvement (like new kitchen) to a house leads to faster appreciation than on a condo
#1 advantage of condo is price tag

--long flight
The shorter segment is always much easier physically. Not really long sleep-deprivation or muscle stiffness due to unnatural restriction of movement.

It pays to reduce the duration of the long segment, so avoid HK or Guangzhou.

Only HK and BJ provide airside hourly hotel

--I used to feel zbs will make me a great contributor to any system, but now I realize localSys is more important.

In Citi muni, I wanted to use remote debugging to understand how the localsys worked, but even the best tool was only helping me in the battle between my brain power and the cummulative brain power sunk in

--movies for future flights
Flight to NY is more stressful, so consider movies.

If can sleep then no need for movie.

* Favor Jap, Chinese. In the emotional genres, western movies never touched me except [[ForrestGump]], [[CuriousCase]]. 
* The most touching movies tend to be love, family...
* Favor adaptations of books
* favor award winners except special effects
* avoid action or crime genres.
* avoid superheros or scifi genres
* avoid period drama
* avoid romantic comedies .. too light-hearted, not serious enough.

Here are some promising titles
