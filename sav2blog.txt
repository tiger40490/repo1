--new blog: Most c++guys don't understand STL
when I recall the STL interviews, it's clear that majority of c++ app developers use STL every year for 5-10 years almost like a black box. Only 1% has the level of insight as Henry Wu. 

Analogy -- Most of us live in a house without knowing the civil engineering.

Many interviewer questions drill in on one or two everyday STL functionality (everyone would have used), just below the surface. These questions filer out majority of candidates. 不求甚解，不加咀嚼，囫囵吞枣 -- I see it in many Indian developers. That's exactly what these interiew questios are designed to identify and sceen out.

--I used to feel zbs will make me a great contributor to any system, but now I realize localSys is more important.

In Citi muni, I wanted to use remote debugging to understand how the localsys worked, but even the best tool was only helping me in the battle between my brain power and the cummulative brain power sunk in

--I used to think ascii format is inefficient and amaterish for config files. That's nothing but speculation based on Windows convention (windows *.ini files is unconventional). In the Unix and internet convention all config files are ascii.
