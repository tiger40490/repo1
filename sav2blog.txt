sim card?

--TOP: 1st/2nd quarter 2019

--productivity concept
Wasted human potential is more apparent in PHL than Sgp

Q: On flight or MRT, would I feel regretful to study/think or to engage with boy?

reading, assimilating, blogging about parenting, wellness, marriage .... can have direct, tangible benefits if put into practice. I wrote many posts on these topics. The act of writing feels productive though roti is zero

--腾飞 in BGC properties is less likely than in Chinese cities  because Chinese investors prefer first-tier metropollis like London, Toronto, Sydney etc. Mind share remains low for Manila.

--Mind museum posed the question "Which city is best for you?"
Q: u want to commute by rail, subway, or walk/cycle?
A: for me, rush hour train frequency is important, so bus and rail are not good enough

Q: how far from city center do you wan to live?
A: I used to prefer closer, but now I think 1-hour distance is acceptable

Q: Do you have a family or as a single?

====unbroken (mastered in 0.txt)
* remote productivity better than feared. I might outperform myself even more if I spent more hours at work.
* diet better than feared -- about 40% lower. I think I would feel much better by skipping home dinner a few times, and eating raw carrot more often but it costs too much
* reunions were satisfying, immediate and without difficulty, better than feared
* boy's weight maintained
* the $40 bike
* iview laptop didn't fail as feared
* boy's grades
* BGC

--XR and I both tend to be too keenly aware of inadequacies/limitations/weaknesses in self and our kids. Inferiority?

Rationally, even if a kid is less brainy than average in class, he/she can still be adequate i.e. good enough.

--Now is seller's market so some people bid 7% above the asking to snatch up a unit. These aggressive buyers need good knowledge about the location

--improvement (like new kitchen) to a house leads to faster appreciation than on a condo
#1 advantage of condo is price tag

--long flight
The shorter segment is always much lighter strain on the body. Less severe effects of long sleep-deprivation and muscle stiffness due to unnatural restriction of movement.

It pays to reduce the duration of the long segment, so avoid HK or Guangzhou.

Only HK and BJ provide airside hourly hotel

--I used to feel zbs will make me a great contributor to any system, but now I realize localSys is more important.

In Citi muni, I wanted to use remote debugging to understand how the localsys worked, but even the best tool was only helping me in the battle between my brain power and the cummulative brain power sunk in

--movies for future flights
Flight to NY is more stressful, so consider movies.

If can sleep then no need for movie.

* Favor Jap, Chinese. In the emotional genres, western movies never touched me except [[ForrestGump]], [[CuriousCase]]. 
* The most touching movies tend to be love, family...
* Favor adaptations of books
* favor award winners except special effects
* avoid action or crime genres.
* avoid superheros or scifi genres
* avoid period drama
* avoid romantic comedies .. too light-hearted, not serious enough.
