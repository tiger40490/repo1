--why PeakRetail:
capLand gave many sg investors confidence about appreciation
:) lower quantum than before .. allowing diversification
:) lower floor than before
10Y gurantee is rare
shops are precious
:) part of 5-star hotel building ... more proven model than BridgeRetail
:( more concentration
:( very small unit
:( left-over unit
--batam
sugg: better check out for day tour
As Andrew pointed out, no real hurry, as rental demand is not proven yet.
:( only 4.8%
:( only 3y
:( residential, not shop
convention center
highest GDP/person in IDN
primte biz (not resort ) location in batam
fx risk?
rent to who? mostly expats? I feel there are few long term renters, so airbnb is the way to go
:( after 3Y? need to engage local agent

--new blog: 20 uphill breakthroughs #wellness/IV/xx
I will use A/B rating for effort and result. Note achiving a B- is huge like an Oscar nomination.
A-|A+ [Sec 2] Chinese compo
B|C [1992] English listening, including BBC
A|B+[1993] English compo + speaking
B|A[2010] java/SQL/Unix QQ. I am a natural and didn't need to struggle too long
C|C [2012] c#. I'm a natural, but it is still an uphill for most people.
B-|C [2017] c++ coding drill. Huge effort but not huge improvement
A|B- [2019] no belly no medical condition, very healthy annd fit except borderline cholesterol

.. rest are steeper uphill. Note the C ratings set the benchmark
C|C [2014] so many properties paid up in full
A|C [2017] c++ QQ, including focused coding experiments to learn rvr, TMP
B|B [2018] weight loss + chin-up
A|B [2018] yoga -- many false starts. Really hard Unthinkable for my entire life until 2018. Huge effort despite limited progress
C|A- [2016-2018] ffree achievement and planning. Hard to achieve at my age with my income

--my healthy is actually better than 5 years ago. I no longer feel tired on long flights

--new blog: Most c++guys don't understand STL
when I recall the STL interviews, it's clear that majority of c++ app developers use STL every year for 5-10 years almost like a black box. Only 1% has the level of insight as Henry Wu. 

Analogy -- Most of us live in a house without knowing the civil engineering.

Many interviewer questions drill in on one or two everyday STL functionality (everyone would have used), just below the surface. These questions filer out majority of candidates. 不求甚解，不加咀嚼，囫囵吞枣 -- I see it in many Indian developers. That's exactly what these interiew questios are designed to identify and sceen out.

Intellectual curiosity vs intellectual laziness

--what to do on MRT alone? 
read tech?
coding?
read letters?
ask friends to call me FIC

--It takes huge efforts to extract a few hours of coding drill, harder than oil sand extraction. I would want to pay extra (train ticket.. prepaid SIM card for google search...) to increase the extraction rate

--productivity concept
Wasted human potential is more apparent in PHL than SGP

Q: On flight or MRT, in hind sight would I feel regretful to study/blog or to engage with boy?
A: if boy opens up then it's worth it. After some amount of engagement, we hit diminishing return

reading, assimilating, blogging about parenting, wellness, marriage .... can have direct, tangible benefits if put into practice. I wrote many posts on these topics. The act of writing feels productive though roti is zero

--I tend to focus on the negative examples in my relationships and take them as personal... Seriously negative and unfair perception
* XR, Nikhil turning cold but not counting Deepak, Ashish Singh, CSDoctor, HenryWu, Wenjia, Longbo, Yihai, Mithun, ...

====unbroken
* reunions 
* boy's Chinese reading / renzi
* my health on long flights
* my swim/jogging/chin-up
* the $40 bike
* iview laptop didn't fail as feared

--improvement (like new kitchen) to a house leads to faster appreciation than on a condo
#1 advantage of condo is price tag

--I used to feel zbs will make me a great contributor to any system, but now I realize localSys is more important.

In Citi muni, I wanted to use remote debugging to understand how the localsys worked, but even the best tool was only helping me in the battle between my brain power and the cummulative brain power sunk in

--I used to think ascii format is inefficient and amaterish for config files. That's nothing but speculation based on Windows convention (windows *.ini files is unconventional). In the Unix and internet convention all config files are ascii.
