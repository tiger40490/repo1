how to reward myself more?

--new blog: python metaprogramming features
feature: module import
feature: runtime code generation and introspection

These are two of the most powerful py features. I wrote in another blog that py reflection is richer than c# and much richer than java

feature: decorator layering and with param
feature: metaclasses. IBM has an article

What's in common among these features? We manipulate modules, classes and attributes as if they are ordinary data. In other words, we manipulate the program itself. That's hallmark of metaprogramming IMHO. We can check other people's idea of "metaproamming" but I don't have to follow theirs.

--d-resort review (low value ... avoid Oth)
:) as planned, did some stretching and coding drill
:) as planned, boy did lots of math 
:) as planned, wild wild wet + buffet but overeating to be badly bloated

i didn't celebrate/reward myself enough esp. for the stretching and coding drill

--healthy diet tips given by SG HPB #orange
recommended -- sugar substitutes; sugar-free drinks; Chinese tea
orange is safe even though not leanest. Orange is not as low-cal as some veg but Singapore HPB (and many experts would agree) picked orange as the safest food.
