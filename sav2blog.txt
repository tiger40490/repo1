--XR and I both tend to be too keenly aware of inadequacies/limitations/weaknesses in self and our kids. Inferiority?

Rationally, even if a kid is less brainy than average in class, he/she can still be adequate i.e. good enough.


--Now is seller's market so some people bid 7% above the asking to snatch up a unit. These aggressive buyers need good knowledge about the location

--wood houses built in the 1920's have better quality and can last longer, even if they need interior rennovation

--many new rental apartments but no new houses

--improvement (like new kitchen) to a house leads to faster appreciation than on a condo
#1 advantage of condo is price tag
