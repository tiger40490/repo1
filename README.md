--extraneous dir in a branch like cpp in a py branch:

I would say don't delete it. It's kind of back-up. I might consider moving them to a "irrelevant" dir in the new branch.

--branch descriptions
* cpp1 -- mostly single-file cpp projects -- so-called lone wolves
* cppProj -- bigger projects
* jProj -- everything is a project. There are no lone wolves. Even a single file has to be in a package directory.
* py1 and perl1 -- mostly lone wolve scripts.
